       "'four years ago i had an accident the kind of accident that can change your life this accident has been the starting point for creating a new product i thought that it was the right time to share a little bit more of this story with you todayi was spending the weekend with my friends in aixlesbains aixlesbains is a charming little town in france with a beautiful lake my friends own a boat there and as it was a sunny day we decided to spend the saturday afternoon sailing on the lakeat one point we discovered a nice cliff so we decided to climb it and then jump into the water the water was so crystal clear there it felt so inviting moreover the cliff was not too high around 8 meters so it didn’t look too dangerous my friends jumped first then it was my turn when i jumped i was afraid to hurt my back on the rocks behind me to avoid injuring myself i decided to jump as far as possible but i got unbalanced and landed in the water on my bottomright after the jump my back felt sore i lay down on my friend’s boat for 15 minutes and the weekend started again as if nothing happened i went wakeboarding and we had a great barbecue that eveningtwo days later i was back at work and my back felt entirely blocked after doing medical tests including xrays and mri the doctors discovered that i had a fracture of my 6th cervical vertebra since then the doctors have been calling me the lucky boy indeed if i had landed in the water at a slightly different angle i could have broken my 1st or 2nd cervical vertebra that would have been a very different storysince this accident my back has been hurting almost daily just after the accident i had to wear a neck brace for eight weeks the problem with the neck brace is that it creates contractures in your back muscles i saw physiotherapists more than 150 times during last four years chiropractors and many other back specialists that helped to reduce the contractures a little bit and for a short period but then the ache would return … again and again i almost gave up i thought that i would have to live the rest of my life with this painfour months ago i was complaining again about my back at the office when my manager told me have you tried to sit on a swiss ball i sat on one for four years at my previous company and that helped to reduce my back painsi was pretty reluctant trying the swiss ball i had heard good feedback about it read some articles but i was never convinced i thought that it might be strange to sit on such a round object especially as i have been sitting for so many years on a normal chair the look of the ball didn’t help convince me to use it eitherbut i was feeling so bad on that day that i decided to order one online to experiment with and see if it could help or noti got my swiss ball a few days later it didn’t look good the one i ordered was green — but i wanted to give it a try and the ball proved to me that i was wrong about itit took me less than two days to adapt to it the first day my lower back was feeling a little painful after two days i asked our office manager to remove my chair from my desk as i only wanted to sit on the ball to see the impact of it three weeks later i was sold my pains decreased and my physiotherapist paul who has been following my progress was impressed by the results on my neck mobility and my back in general at that time i didn’t change anything no extra sport no other therapy — so it was clear to me that the ball did have a real impact on my backfour months have now passed since i replaced my chair with the ball and the benefits of the ball are still here my back pains are almost gone which is a great feelingwhen i received my big green ball at the office my colleagues became intrigued by this weird object sitting next to my desk so they asked me lots of questions about it and i started telling them my story it was then that i discovered that many people of our generation already have back paini started doing some research online to find some nicelooking swiss balls but i couldn’t find anything i found hundreds of regular greenpinkyelloworange plastic balls but nothing visually appealingso i took on the challenge to create the first nice swiss ball that would look more like an art object than a plastic ballthat’s where it all started yet i had no idea about creating a product like this what i knew was that i needed an illustrator to make the ball look unique and someone who could work on the shell and sew it around the balli contacted mike lemanski who is a supertalented illustrator based in the uk mike has been doing fantastic illustrations for monocle nike new york times lacoste etc i thought mike would never reply to my email but he did reply and thought the idea was interesting so he wanted to help mehere is what he wrote mefirstly i think the project sounds really interesting i don’t believe i have ever been asked to cover a swiss ball before but there is a first time for everything i really like the idea of covering the ball with some fabricafter receiving his email i was super excited to move this forward then i found two textile designers in zurich kim and yael who could help make the first prototypekim and yael have been working hard on this it’s a challenge to create a shell for this kind of shape and its size brings a lot of constraints to make something looking nicehere are three things we have been taking in consideration to build this productand here is our very first try it didn’t look great yet but we used it to make sure the fabric fits the ball wellwhile yael and kim were working on improving the shell mike was working on the design of the ball taking into consideration all the constraints of the object itself he has been doing a great job working on some unique patterns it was inspiring to see the prototype coming together step by steptoday we are happy to share the first prototype it’s just the beginning so there are still adjustments to make but this first product is one we are ready to show we call this design orbitmike has also been working on some other designs that are beautiful and i can’t wait to share them with youwe thought it’s a great time to share this product with you we are building it for people so we are looking for feedbackif you want to get updates about this project if you have any feedbackideas or if you just want to try it out fill out the short form below and i will reach out to youhappy new year everyone and let’s sit better in 2018pierreemmanuel'"
