Among those insights is that we can improve our ability to generate novel and useful solutions to creative problems by shaping our surroundings in line with scientific findings.My focus in the first piece was on a body of work linking perceptions of distance to heightened creativity. I want to turn next to the subject of light, another facet of space design that scientists and design professionals have been studying for its effects on cognitive processing, as well as on our physical and mental health. My goals and methods in this article remain the same: to share techniques for maximizing creative productivity in physical space by drawing on experimental data, field studies, and the practices of eminent creatives from past and present.Central to any discussion of light is the circadian rhythm. A mashup of the Latin words for \u201capproximately\u201d (circa) and \u201cday\u201d (diem), the term refers to the roughly 24-hour period it takes the earth to revolve once around its axis.One obvious manifestation of this perpetual cycle is the evolving condition of the sun. At dawn, it is low on the horizon, moderate in intensity, and amber in color. By morning, the sun is on its upward trajectory, gaining brilliance, and the light becoming cooler in hue as the day wears on. That pattern is reversed after peaking at midday, until it finally disappears in a warm and sometimes even fiery blaze at nightfall.Many aspects of human physiology are biologically pegged to this period, most noticeably the internal clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. For example, the release of the hormone melatonin, which prepares us for sleep, is triggered by the onset of darkness, whereas the cool light of morning suppresses its production, enabling us to fully awaken and become energized before the cycle repeats itself again. Other hormones ebb and flow to regulate bodily functions throughout the cycle as well.Study after study shows that regular and sufficient quantities of sleep are vital to both physical and mental health.Regardless of the myth of the depressed, debauched, and destitute artist, the truth is that being at your best creatively means being at your best physiologically and psychologically. Attuning your sleep-wake cycle to the circadian rhythm is an important step in that quest.The challenge is that we are far-removed from the purely natural environments of our caveman ancestors, for whom the sun was the sole source of light and who did not spend around 90 percent of their waking hours indoors, as we do. Fortunately, there are techniques you can use to harmonize your creative space with the circadian cycle.As you might expect, one of the most effective things you can do to reap the benefits of natural light is to bring it into your space. That means, first and foremost, avoiding interiors with no windows.To give you some measure of the havoc that the absence of daylight can wreak on mind and body, researchers found that people who work in windowless environments on average get 46 minutes less sleep on work nights, experience lower-quality rest, and are less physically active during the workday than colleagues who are afforded adequate exposure. If that weren\u2019t disturbing enough, medical scientists report higher levels of depression, anxiety, delirium, and even psychosis among patients lacking access to outside views in healthcare facilities.In many cases, you will want to bring more natural light into your space. Here are some tips.For starters, position mirrors across from window walls to bounce whatever light does filter in back into the room. Choose pale colors throughout. Opt for higher gloss paint finishes than normally recommended. Replace solid doors with glazed units. Minimize window drapery. Steer clear of thick pile carpet and other light-sucking materials on floors and walls. Keep surfaces free of dust for maximum reflectiveness. And hang artwork evocative of the sunlit outdoors \u2014 a number of studies indicate that visual representations of eye-catching scenery can elicit the same psychological response as seeing the real thing.For the ultimate in circadian synchronization, take a page from playwright George Bernard Shaw and build yourself a freestanding studio mounted on a mechanical turntable that you can rotate with a hand crank to track the path of the sun.Of course, too much of a good thing can be bad. A work environment with excessive sunlight can result in glare, unwanted heat gain, faded materials, and other unintended consequences. If that\u2019s an issue in your space, I suggest installing Venetian blinds, exterior awnings, landscaping, or other configurable shading devices to modulate light intensity and direction as needed.I presented research in the previous article indicating that exposure to the color blue improves creative task performance. This naturally leads to the question of whether working under the cool light of day will bring about a similar boost in creative problem-solving skills.At least one published paper concludes that it does. So does an abundance of historical and anecdotal evidence. Many accomplished writers, for example, favor the morning hours for exercising their powers of imagination, leaving the remainder for analytic tasks, such as proofing, copy editing, and reading. Interestingly, such an approach is consistent with findings that brain fluency shifts from so-called right-side dominance to left-side dominance over the course of the day.That said, a variety of factors are likely to play into your efforts to coordinate creative time with daylight. Some are practical: Frank Kafka, for example, was compelled to pursue his literary interests at night because of his day job as an insurance executive. Others are biological: You might be a night owl or a morning person by nature. None of this takes away from the premise that our general productivity and well-being rely on healthy intakes of natural light.Now let\u2019s address the elephant in the room: electric light.First, the good news. We\u2019re no longer constrained by the rise and fall of the sun to function at all hours of the day.The bad news? Artificial illumination can thoroughly disrupt our circadian rhythms by exposing us to blue light at all hours of the day.And not just from light bulbs. Our computer screens, mobile devices, televisions, and assorted electronic doodads all emit light in the blue spectrum.The effect of this luminous bombardment is equivalent to smashing your internal clock with a hammer, and then expecting it to work properly.But it\u2019s not all bad news. Ironically, technology can help us solve some of the problems that technology has wrought.The first step is to replace your fixed-temperature bulbs with app-controlled LED lighting products, such as the Philips Hue. With these smart systems, you can program your fixtures to mimic the color transformations and intensities of the sun in real time. Keep them set at amber at night to further minimize pattern disruption.Yes, some color-changing bulbs cost more up-front than their analog counterparts. But those costs will be offset by reduced energy bills, longer periods between product replacement, and higher productivity.When it comes to electronic devices, the best strategy for maintaining circadian rhythms is to power them off one to two hours before bedtime. Barring that, install a free program like f.lux for Macs or Windows (in beta) on your computers. These apps automatically transition your screen from its default blue to a deep amber at sunset. A similar feature, called Night Shift, is available for smartphones in both iOS and Android.Want a low-tech solution that might do the most to reduce blue light? Try donning amber colored shades after dark. Dorky never looked so good.Sometimes less is more, off is on, and dimmer is brighter.That\u2019s what psychologists Anna Steidel and Lioba Werth discovered when they assessed the effects of light intensity on creative insight. According to their findings, on average people exhibit a greater aptitude for solving creative problems working under relatively dim light (150 lux) than in a typical office (500 lux) or highly illuminated setting, like a television studio (1,500 lux).As for why darker is better for out-of-the-box thinking, Steidel theorizes that bright lights give people the impression they\u2019re under surveillance, which in turn makes them feel less free to take risks for fear of criticism.I have a couple of additional theories to offer. First, I would suggest that we\u2019re less cognizant of the boundaries of space when the surrounding walls are underlit, as they are in Diane Walker\u2019s eloquent portrait of a young Steve Jobs. This effectively makes a space seem like it\u2019s expanding, which in turn broadens our receptiveness to new ideas, a cognitive phenomenon I describe at length in the opening article of this series.Besides enlarging our perception of space, low-light conditions also discourage the eye from narrowly focusing on the details of our surroundings, leaving us free to engage in the abstract, big-picture style of mental processing associated with creative thinking.Take a look again at the photograph of Steve Jobs. Do you see something else in the picture that links lighting to creativity?If you guessed the standing lamp by Jobs\u2019 side, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a subtle but nonetheless credible representation of an idea bulb.An idea bulb is a graphic illustration of that moment of elation that arrives when we suddenly arrive at an answer to a creative problem.Its roots lie in our longstanding habit of linguistically fusing creativity and light, as in having a \u201cbright idea\u201d or experiencing a \u201cflash of brilliance.\u201dAs far as I\u2018ve been able to determine, the idea bulb originally appears as a mechanical device attached to a hat in a 1935 Betty Boop cartoon. Seven years later, another Disney production shows it floating in space, establishing the convention for how it\u2019s rendered today.So powerful is our association of the light bulb with idea generation that researchers recently determined that the mere sight of a naked bulb caused subjects to score higher on creativity assessment tests than those who took the tests without the stimulus. (But only if the bulb has a classic pear shape; tests involving tubular and other nontraditional profiles did not yield the same results.)As entertaining as studies like this one might strike us, its underlying motivation is consistent with the goal of creativity-driven design psychology in general: to find those conditions of physical space that make us happier, healthier, and more productive individuals.Written byWritten byAbout this Collection","1660":"DIY ingredients delight those looking for natural recipes to replicate at home.

I had friends reaching out to me stating that I was \u201cBlowing up on their Twitter feed.\u201d I wasn\u2019t expecting the exposure, but I am so glad I was able to have such a positive impact on so many people.This email was a reply to one of my teammates, Madalyn, who sent an email to our internal Olark OOTO listserv letting us know she was taking sick time for mental health.It is incredibly hard to be honest about mental health in the typical workplace. In situations like this, it is so easy to tell your teammates you are \u201cnot feeling well.\u201d Even in the safest environment it is still uncommon to be direct with your coworkers about mental health issues. I wanted to call this out and express gratitude for Madalyn\u2019s bravery in helping us normalize mental health as a normal health issue.Madalyn was really appreciative of my email and asked if she could tweet it:I told her to go for it. I had no idea my response would become so visible \u2014 the reactions revealed that my stance on mental health in the workplace is unconventional, to say the least:I started realizing how impactful my email had been after I began reading some of the responses to Madalyn\u2019s tweet.Some of the responses brought tears to my eyes (there are 100s like this).There were so many stories of people wishing they worked at a place where their CEO cared about their health, and so many people congratulating me on doing such a good thing. This should be business as usual. We have a lot of work to do.As executives, we lead organizations made up of people who\u2019ve come together to make an impact. Our job is to empower and motivate our teams to maximize the impact of our organization for our customers, our employees, our shareholders, and the world. At Olark our mission is to make business human, and from these comments it\u2019s clear that not all leaders see the opportunity to increase impact by focusing on the humans that make up their organization.It\u2019s 2017. I cannot believe that it is still controversial to speak about mental health in the workplace when 1 in 6 americans are medicated for mental health.It\u2019s 2017. I cannot believe that it is still controversial to offer paid sick leave. Did you know that only 73% of full time employees in the US have paid sick leave?It\u2019s 2017. We are in a knowledge economy. Our jobs require us to execute at peak mental performance. When an athlete is injured they sit on the bench and recover. Let\u2019s get rid of the idea that somehow the brain is different.I know this is a lot to take in, and we have a lot of work to do. But there are some easy actions you can take today to be part of the solution:If you have or need ideas for expressing gratitude, or ideas to help your colleagues feel more safe, shoot me a note: benc@olark.com. If there\u2019s enough interest, I\u2019ll write up some of the ideas we\u2019ve tried.Over the weekend I just experienced the tip of the iceberg that is mental health in the workplace. If you want to get involved there are great organizations that support mental health awareness in the tech industry like MHPrompt and OSMI, as well as Mental Health First Aid Project from the National Council for Behavioral Health. Madalyn will also be speaking about Mental Health as part of a panel at Grace Hopper 2017.Thanks Madalyn, Karl, Kate, Kat, and Matt for reading drafts of this post.Written byWritten by","2458":"This week, I finally convinced my father to try a cannabis salve for his arthritis. You would think after four years of reporting on the marijuana world, I would have made headway on this long ago. After all, like over 85\u2026","2511":"Recently I was on an 11-day staycation that involved 2 weekends and a week off work in between. The period was filled with some family time doing fun activities and plenty of naps. Family time was great, of course. Who doesn\u2019t love mini golfing, go karts (or \u201cgo tarts\u201d as my 4-year-old calls them), bowling, swimming, and roasting marshmallows by the fire? Eating out a few times was nice. I\u2019m a fan of taking naps! My partner\u2019s mom came to stay with us for a couple days so that was fun. I still managed to get in a few runs including a 10-mile race that I\u2019d been planning on for a while. My partner and my daughter came to watch the race, followed by my daughter participating in her first race and gaining her first medal. What a proud moment for us all! Overall, this is sounding like a pretty good vacation, right? It was lovely!So why were we getting crabby and frustrated by the end of it? My daughter started acting out and I was feeling completely \u201coff\u201d. One of these days I sat down and started journaling and recognized a big factor. The thing about the staycation was that, despite being at home during this time, we were off our normal routine.For kids, it\u2019s important to maintain a regular schedule so that they know what to expect and depend on. My daughter\u2019s schedule was already greatly impacted, because, being a child of divorced parents, the regular parenting time schedule changes in the summer to allow for longer periods for vacations. While this is beneficial in a lot of ways, it can be very confusing for her 4-year-old brain. Thus, confusion = moodiness = acting out.Yet, she wasn\u2019t the only one. I found myself getting crabby easily and just feeling disconnected. I was missing many of my regular activities including meditation, going to church, seeing some co-workers and working from home. I may have gotten a little carried away with the whole \u201cwe have no schedule to worry about\u201d idea. We were eating and sleeping, of course, but the time frames and the foods were a little different than usual. It was nice to not to be a slave to a specific schedule. However, after a while, I felt like I had little direction and was lacking in the motivation department.Writing about this topic gave me the wherewithal to get honest with myself: I just function so much better when I have a routine. There can be some variation, but if I have too many days of \u201cdo as you please\u201d, it doesn\u2019t end up being in my best interest or the interest of those around me.Merriam-Webster defines a routine as \u201ca regular course of procedure\u201d (https:\/\/www.merriam-webster.com\/dictionary\/routine). The word originates from the French word \u201croute\u201d. The concept of having a routine is not foreign. Businesses have focused on the importance of routine for a long time, because they understand how much routines affect an increase in productivity. Health and wellness experts have touted the benefits of having a routine as it relates to mental, emotional, spiritual and even physical well-being.There are even websites dedicated to the significance of developing and maintaining routines, particularly morning routines. Sources such as mymorningroutine.com (https:\/\/mymorningroutine.com\/) have plenty of resources for assisting you with creating a routine. Subscribe to their email list and they will send you daily emails with helpful ideas. At Writingroutines.com (https:\/\/www.writingroutines.com\/, example routines are provided specifically for writers to make the most of their structured work time.Why do I agree that routine is so important? I believe it has a lot to do with commitment. If you are truly dedicated to being the best you can be, personal growth is a must. To grow or succeed personally, it takes commitment to certain thoughts and behaviors that are aligned with achieving this success.Routine also provides us with regular practice at doing whatever it is we do. Growing, learning and achieving take a lot practice. Obviously, the more you practice something, the better you will become at it. If I want to become a better blogger or the best blogger I can be, I\u2019m going to have to practice writing, posting and marketing. The more I practice I have, the higher the probability that I will be successful blogger. To get in the most practice I can, having a routine will ensure my time commitment to behaving in ways that accomplish that goal. Is this making sense?Occasionally veering away from a routine is fine and sometimes even allows for our creativity to flourish. Once in a while, it\u2019s a relief to have some spontaneous activities to avoid becoming stagnant or rigid. You want to allow yourself to experience the flow of the universe. There must be room for that to avoid experiencing a spiritual death. Change can be very healthy if it isn\u2019t too much on a regular basis. In fact, when building your own routine you should have some free time scheduled as an integral part. The key is balance to avoid too much of a good thing, one way or the other.Simple time management is what it comes down to. I really want to experience the best that life has to offer. I want to be an active part of life; a healthy individual of mind, body and soul. I want to succeed at the things that are aligned with my soul\u2019s purpose and that takes commitment and practice. It also requires periods of freedom and creativity. When I follow a regular routine that ensures all of this, it provides not just stability but the growth that I just don\u2019t want to live without.The moral of the story is\u2026establish a routine and stick to it!Written byWritten by","2866":"By Geoffrey JamesThere\u2019s a scene in the Oscar-winning movie where Woodie Allen sees a happy couple on the street and asks them why they\u2019re so happy. Their response is classic:","2894":"(How everything, including Poverty, gets Co-opted)There are many ways to be poor, most of them not fun. Poverty most commonly and most clearly strikes in the realm of resources. When one is economically poor they are short of basic resources like healthy food, water, clothing and shelter.When a person is biologically poor or anatomically impoverished they may have disabilities or severe pain or deformities.When someone is socially poor, they will likely be isolative or isolated. They will suffer loneliness and fatigues with no support. They may confuse and trouble others, leading to greater sorrow and conflict for themselves.Sometimes poverty even strikes the mind, and you can\u2019t think straight, can\u2019t hold a thought, can\u2019t read or interpret the world like most others around you can.About the only thing the poor can claim for their own is that they exist at the bottom rung, is that they suffer the most, is that when they rise they are doing one of the most heroic things because of where their starting point resides.But it seems now that even these little things they have are being co-opted from them. Take Thrift Stores for example. Buildings packed with goods, discount priced so that even the downtrodden can live as colorful and equipped as possible. Go into one anymore and check for yourself who\u2019s shopping there. Watch the mostly female wealthy shopaholics crowding each other out for the 80th bra and purse the moment it hits the bin. Watch the guys walking around scanning price-tags and barcodes on watches and used books, trying to find a way to snatch a bargain and sell it online to some wealthy Saudi on the other side of the world who can\u2019t as easily grab certain brands. The fact is, that you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a single mom and her struggling children searching for the lower-priced treasures which had landed in these stores to target people like her and her family.There are other ways poverty gets kidnapped. Take for example things like Dyslexia, or Attention Deficit Disorder, or Introversion. Or just plain take \u201cnerd\u201d status. Dyslexia used to be a real condition whereby certain students were behind their peers, not for lack of effort or intellectual gifting, but because something in their eyes or brains was flipping letters upside-down and backwards. How quickly did this legitimate condition become a problem-du-jour for successful parents who wanted their children to have an excuse for their low performances. The occurrences started to sky-rocket. Even more so was the phenomenon of ADD. Not that no one ever legitimately had this intense inability to focus on things, but now everyone has it. And most recently, now all of the Extroverts (the Socially Skillful Smooth Swimmers of the World) are latent Introverts. Think about this. The idea before of describing certain friends as introverted was to show that it\u2019s not as easy for some as it is for others to sail the waters of group interaction. But now that the top swimmers are claiming to have had it all along, they\u2019ve pulled the rug right out from under the truly socially stymied, by revealing that they, the more successful, not only enjoy the graces of partying it up, but they\u2019ve really just overcome what the other poor suckers couldn\u2019t.So how is it that these things come to be co-opted? Or why would anyone want to co-opt them?Part of it is fashion. But what is fashion? Is it just pretty clothes? Not hardly. Skim through the years of G.Q. and Vogue magazines, and discover for yourselves rugged and lithe beautiful enough human beings wearing dead things, covered in sweat, covered in mud or gasoline. Sometimes wearing burlappish material, other times bunny soft. There almost appears to be no rhyme or reason. Jeans low-cut, tapered, rolled, straight, baggy, torn, ripped, shreaded, barely-there-anymore. The point is that \u201cbeautiful\u201d people may drape themselves in animal feces and sell us on the notion that this is what is \u201ccool\u201d, and we\u2019ll likely follow them down the runway. We seem to not even realize we\u2019re buying it, fooled by the bodies, noses, ears and eyes of the well-crafted models, not recognizing it is their glimmer and not what they are adorning themselves with which beacons so richly.But why should this lead to identity theft, especially of the poor? Because people want to win in all categories. If sympathies go up for the poor, the \u201cwealthy\u201d want a piece of that. If bargains and charity go out to the needy, the \u201cgifted\u201d don\u2019t want to miss those \u201ctreats\u201d either. In short, people want their cake and to eat it also. You used to have to choose. Choose between things like \u201chigh road\u201d or \u201clow road\u201d, \u201cwell-traveled\u201d or \u201crarely walked\u201d. Now we want to stroll the thoroughfares to \u201cget there quickly\u201d, but we want the recognition and virtue of \u201cseeming to have gone it alone\u201d and on the byroad.What\u2019s the solution to all of this? It hurt for many to be a nerd. They had to watch you from the outside, enjoying your great cake of so many wonderful social frostings and decadence. Join them if you would, but not to pretend you were always one of them, that you felt and feel their pain, not to take their day when their star finally rises. But to say I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have let you be a nerd, be an outcast.And when you shop, consider spending the currency you have on things meant for you and your echelon. Don\u2019t rob from the poor what little is left out for them. Be thrifty, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but don\u2019t step on the backs of the sufferer to \u201cget all the gold\u201d.Written byWritten by","2927":"I get you.I get you because just like you, I\u2019ve struggled with the overwhelming need to be validated every day like some parking ticket. I get you because just like you, I\u2019ve reminded myself more than once that obsessing over my hair, my weight, and the fact that my hips are spreading like the horizon is opposite from what is acceptable and healthy thinking.I get you because just like you, I used to think what I did wasn\u2019t good enough unless somebody said it was.I\u2019d love to tell you I\u2019m completely free of all that nonsense, but I can\u2019t lie, I still have those days. I say that nonsense because that\u2019s what other people say it is. Ridiculous, crazy, bogus. But it sure feels real, doesn\u2019t it?Although I\u2019ve come a long way, the craving for affirmation-validation still edges its way into places where it does not belong.My love language is words of affirmation. My husband does well with this, true story. Others speak words of encouragement as well. But sometimes I have this crazy idea that when there are no words of affirmation about what I\u2019ve accomplished or how I look, it\u2019s like people are saying to themselves: \u201cMy mother taught me if I can\u2019t say anything nice, don\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d Granted, I\u2019m not even sure if all mothers teach this, but I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a good probability since that\u2019s what mothers do.So girlfriend if this is you \u2014 if you are waiting for someone to say: \u201cHey there, _______, you are looking pretty great every day of your life\u201d and \u201cHey there, _______, you are doing a fantastic job at whatever it is you do\u201d, then this is for you:You are and you are.Because more than half the things we think people are thinking, they aren\u2019t even thinking.Because more than half the things we beat ourselves up about, aren\u2019t even legit.Because more than half of what we see as wrong with ourselves, people don\u2019t even see, and if they do, it doesn\u2019t look the same to them. It probably looks better and what does it matter?Because more than half is pretty darn close to all. Which means our thought process has probably been all wrong more than half the time. In other words, our perception has been skewed.Our insecurities feed on our obsession. We need to take our eyes off of our insecurities because without that obsessive focus, they will die off and true change will come.We\u2019re not the girl from high school who let herself go, or the girl at work who can\u2019t do anything right. We\u2019re the intelligent, bright, one-of-a-kind girl who has a lot to offer this world.We can stop walking into restaurants, or work, or onto ball-fields, or beaches, or wherever our feet happen to take us with the old mindset full of thoughts like: \u201cHow do I look? Do I look okay? Is my hair okay? Is that extra roll showing? Are my arms covered enough? Did I stuff everything in? If only I looked like her\u2026\u201dInstead of doing that, let\u2019s do this:Enjoy where we are and who we are with without feeling others need to affirm us at every turn. Let\u2019s just be comfortable being us \u2014 the us we are right now, not the us we will be after we lose that weight or get that degree or land that job.There\u2019s an enemy of our soul who would rather see us wallowing than winning. An enemy who wants us so chained up in our own self-image battles, we can\u2019t even see the real battle we need to be fighting. The battle for truth and light and what really matters.The only affirmation we need is that we are here for a purpose and who doesn\u2019t look and feel awesome fulfilling their purpose?Pray to see through spiritual eyes because we are spiritual beings. Before we can be light we need to see light.Let\u2019s draw strength from our strengths. We have them. God has given them to us. Still need words of affirmation? His Word is full of them.Maybe our outside self can use some work but our inside self is who we really are. Our inside self doesn\u2019t wrinkle and dimple and travel south. Our inside self doesn\u2019t need trips to the salon or jewelry or a tan. But our inside self does need a realignment from time to time. Ugly on the inside seeps right through the skin. How\u2019s that for a word picture?Our inside self needs a deep-rooted connection to the God of the universe. When our inside self is spiritually healthy our mindset will be healthier, too.Our outside jars of clay may crack and crumble, but inside is where eternal things happen.Maybe your love language is not words of affirmation and you don\u2019t give a flying leap whether anyone thinks you\u2019re a cutie patootie or smarter than a 5th grader. You\u2019re thinking this all sounds shallow and whiny. You want to say just get over yourself.You\u2019re right.But we all have our days and we all have our stuff that can feel like hands around our throats. We all need to be sensitive to that person next to us who may need a compassionate friend. Maybe you don\u2019t struggle with this, but maybe she does. Reach out your hand and help her up.So if you are the girl who needs validation, may I encourage you that you are not alone in these feelings that have made you feel bad about feeling them.You can be satisfied with who you are and what you have accomplished without requiring validation from those around you. A kind word of affirmation and encouragement is sweet, but you don\u2019t need it to prove your worth.Soon you will find you can live without those affirming words just fine, even if it is your love language. As soon as you let go of having to hear those words, you\u2019ll see that they will find you anyway.Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God\u2019s sight. 1 Peter 3:3\u20134 (New International Version).Be blessed, friend, because you are of great worth in God\u2019s sight.He has validated you.DorisDoris Swift is a the author of Goodbye, Regret: Forgiving Yourself of Past Mistakes.

It was a sabbatical of sorts, but not as long or productive as what academics do. A friend asked me how my \u201cwalk-about\u201d went, but it was more of a stay-about. Besides a family trip to see the eclipse (amazing) and hike in the Great Smoky Mountains, I stayed at home. I spent time with the family, getting stuff done around the house, or doing, well, nothing.My goal was to stop.I wanted to create some mental distance from the things I obsess over \u2014 i.e., all things climate, clean economy, and sustainable business. And to a large extent, because global news and national politics deeply impact those areas, I avoided the news as well. I gave myself some time to not worry about, at the macro level, the state of the global climate or our (apparently) fragile democracy.It was a great relief to stop feeling like I should use every free minute for something productive. (\u2190Tweet this)And at the micro\/personal level, it was a great relief to stop feeling like I should use every free minute \u2014 on a flight, during the weekend, waiting in line \u2014 for something productive (like getting some damn email out of the way). Seriously, just releasing myself from my in-box for weeks was wondrous. (I did this by (a) putting an out-of-office message that said I would never see the email, and (b) having my assistant as backup. I recognize that not everyone has the luxury of the latter for help, but anyone can act as your emergency backup. You can always give important people \u2014 bosses, family, clients \u2014 your cell).So, while my purpose was not to come to any grand conclusions about life, I now have a month\u2019s distance from the time off. I have a few take-aways.Take regular breaks over all time scalesConsistently commit to \u201csabbaticals\u201d, or breaks, especially in stressful times (which I think many agree is now). Every few years or so, taking some weeks or months away from your work would be good. But I recognize that an extended break is an incredible luxury and doesn\u2019t fit everyone\u2019s job or lifestyles. But at least annually, regular vacations \u2014 and real ones where you stop everything \u2014 are critical.And even weekly, take time off from thinking and worrying about your work and the world. There\u2019s a reason so many cultures and religions have break days. After all, the word \u201csabbatical\u201d comes from the word \u201cSabbath,\u201d or rest. In Spanish, Saturday is \u201csabado.\u201d We should listen to the etymology gods.Daily breaks are important too. These times need to be free from guilt that you should be doing something else. Whatever practices of meditation or consciousness you can create, do it. For some, it is actual meditation (I\u2019ve been sitting still daily for a few years now). For others, it could be cooking or running or anything that takes you out of your head. For me, this summer, it was tennis. It\u2019s very hard to think about the world when a ball keeps coming at you every couple of seconds.Take breaks from the newsIt\u2019s important that you stop looking at what\u2019s going on in the world during these breaks. In my work, I\u2019m trying to help build a thriving world and tackle overwhelming issues like climate change. It\u2019s a pretty stressful time for those of us in this space. There is good news of course, but every day there\u2019s something that happens (usually in the U.S.) that\u2019s a gut punch to my values or strikes fear. It\u2019s important to get away from the ups and downs. To really avoid the world, you have to turn off your technology\u2026Take breaks from being connectedI mostly failed on this one during my time off. I did remove Twitter and Facebook from my phone, and I plan to keep them off. But I still managed to use my phone a lot \u2014 reading, using GPS, gaming. But during my family vacation week, we took a phone sabbatical for a day. It was fantastic. The day was so much more human: we had to, you know, talk to each other, even while driving for hours. It seems like it\u2019s becoming a skill, and a top priority for mental health, to break the phone habit. I recommend the app Moment to track your time on your phone. You\u2019ll likely discover that you pick that thing up a shocking number of times and spend hours on it, every day.I\u2019m resolved to lessen the tethers to technology and strengthen the ones to people. (\u2190 Tweet this.)Take breaks from yourselfI\u2019m trying to spend more time worrying about what someone else in the world needs. Right now, it could be something as simple as raising awareness about the crisis in Puerto Rico (here\u2019s a list of ways to donate). But we can also focus, regularly, on others in our immediate family. (I know, the parents of small or medium sized children reading this are thinking, \u201cIsn\u2019t every day focused on what the kids need?\u201d). Taking some time on the weekend or during the evening to focus solely on what my wife or one of my sons needs is rewarding. And it\u2019s a respite from my own stresses and issues.Finally, two smaller, mini-realizations\u2026Stay out of the comments sectionsEven when I\u2019m back connected \u2014 and I need to be \u2014 I plan to spend close to zero time reading comments in any public media. The replies in Twitter can get profoundly unproductive (and now people can get nasty with 280 characters \u2014 oh, joy). Caveat: Some readers have pointed out that a \u201ccurated\u201d digital space can be really productive. That\u2019s true, and if you have a smaller circle of friends you trust on Facebook, then the conversations can be a good experience. But I\u2019m talking about the general comment sections on public media like Twitter or any news site \u2014 those dialogs out in the wild world are ugly.Clean up somethingOn my sabbatical, the only \u201cproductive\u201d thing I did was tackle some home projects. And then, near the end, I started a few administrative projects\u2026but only in bite-sized chunks. Getting some control over some nagging area \u2014 a bit at a time so it doesn\u2019t drag you from the higher value work you need to do \u2014 feels great.For example, I\u2019ve been cleaning up some old filing cabinets by grabbing a couple files a day and seeing if I still need them (there\u2019s not much you need physically anymore). And I started going thru my entire contact database. I\u2019m deleting some older contacts, and figuring out who I need better contact info on. In batches of 15 or so contacts per day (less than 10 minutes), it will take me a year to explore my 5000 names. But this list is an important asset, and I haven\u2019t tended to it well enough. It also feels good to remind myself of my personal connections \u2014 old friends and colleagues I should talk to more.Ok, that\u2019s about it. As I said, no grand conclusions. But I\u2019m resolved to lessen the tethers to technology and strengthen the ones to people. And I\u2019m building more rhythms of work and breaks into my days, weeks, and years.(If you liked this, please hit the clap button many times so others can find it.)Fyi, I tweet here as \u201cAndrewWinston\u201dAndrew Winston advises many of the world\u2019s leading companies on how to navigate and profit from solving humanity\u2019s biggest challenges.

This is all available sooner than what you think.Some of the progress you make may be things that others might not notice but are changes that you know you\u2019ve accomplished and find valuable because you see it in yourself. These are the actions that can take you to the path of greater self-awareness as you grow in your relationship with yourself.Here are the top 10 ways to connect with yourself and create a calmer life.Physical activity is one of the most common recommendations for feeling better \u2014 because it works! Countless studies have shown that improved physical and psychological health happens through movement. Getting moving can be as simple as a walk around the block. It shifts your perspective, interrupts your thought process and gets your blood flowing.Talk it out to yourself, a friend, the dog, etc. Sometimes we really just need to hear ourselves out loud. As you hear yourself it\u2019s easier to uncover the thoughts and feelings just under the surface. You allow yourself the privilege to get clear on your own internal process. This is what shapes your view of the situation and how you feel. You make the abstract thoughts more concrete and now you have options about what you can do with them.The act of creating something, anything, helps you to think differently. Gather some supplies, so when you need to create, they are available. In a pinch, all you really need is a piece of paper and a pencil. Scribble, draw, make patterns, etc. Just get the creativity flowing. It doesn\u2019t have to be a masterpiece, that\u2019s not the point. Leave perfectionism out of it. Your goal is to introduce more flexibility into your capacity for problem-solving and creativity helps.Not everyone experiences hunger in the same way. Emotional eating might mask the early stages of hunger. It could be that increased anxiety and irritability are early hunger signs that come before your stomach starts to rumble. This is an area where you can raise your awareness of your individual hunger signals. Give yourself a minute to check in and see if you need nourishment to refuel. If you do, eat a well-balanced nourishing meal, preferably without looking at a screen while you eat. Enjoy your food and the experience of taking good care of yourself.We are social beings and sometimes we just need to be with others. Spending time with a friend can take your mind off your current worries for a bit. It\u2019s a break that can get you out of your head and the all-consuming thoughts about emotional eating. Your troubles won\u2019t disappear, but if there isn\u2019t an emergency, it\u2019s okay to give yourself some space and shift your focus for a while.Being with others and listening to their challenges will remind you that no one in life escapes difficult situations or relationships. We\u2019re all in this together and being together helps to shift your mindset from, \u201cI\u2019m in this all alone,\u201d to \u201cwe all have struggles; now, how can I handle this better?\u201dEscape! Yes, escape into something just for fun! When was the last time you laughed just because something silly happened? Or when was the last time you played a game, just because you like it? When did you last watch your favorite movie?Push the pause button and allow yourself to let go of seriousness and have a laugh.Journaling has a long track record of helpfulness. In fact, it\u2019s one of the time-tested ways of getting to know yourself better. You can write it out in note form, bullet journaling with colorful pens and drawings and you can always do it the old-fashioned way with paragraphs of your musings. The point is that writing out how you feel helps you organize your thoughts, clarify your ideas and stop them from cycling through your thought process without examination. You may even generate ideas and plans that take you where you want to go.Take the time to slow down, stop thinking about the others and put yourself in the equation. What is it that you need right now? What do you think you will need later today? It can be as simple as going to bed earlier, having a cup of tea, paying a bill, making an appointment, getting a new pair of shoes, etc. All of these things are also self-care. You are less stressed for having accomplished the task. Think about your needs and self-care on a continuum, sometimes it\u2019s small like putting on a sweater when you\u2019re cold. Sometimes it\u2019s big like moving for a better job. Both are practicing self-care.Sad, Mad, Glad. These all mean different things to different people and I bet you can refine your feelings even more. You can begin by thinking about all of the feelings surrounding the first one that pops into your head. Sad can be broken-down further to include, disappointed, regretful, grieving, gutted, isolated, lonely, etc. The feelings you name give you more information about what you need to feel better. They give you direction.Allow yourself quiet time to sit through the distractions. Take some time to sit and be still. It will take practice. Turn off the distractions. Allow yourself to experience just nothing. Start off small and take your time. Experience what it\u2019s like for 3 minutes, then try 6 minutes, then 9 minutes. Some days will be easy and some days will be next to impossible to quiet yourself. That\u2019s okay.This list is just a beginning to help you get started. There are many supportive and nurturing ways to care for yourself.Take the risk to get to know your needs, care for yourself and become a Conscious Eater.Get the tips and techniques you need to eat well and feel good about your body. You can have a peaceful relationship with food. Get your copy of the 5 Step Stress Eating Quick Stop.Written byWritten by","3438":"You\u2019ve heard the saying before. I\u2019m going to tell you why it\u2019s bad advice.In fourth grade I stared blankly at the \u201c10 commandments\u201d our teacher had written on the overhead. Bullets included things like: \u201cTreat others the way you want to be treated\u201d.None really struck a chord with me, but the last one in particular bothered me: \u201cBe Yourself.\u201d I felt my previously foggy focus sharpen as I rolled the words over in my mouth: \u201cbe yourself.\u201d No matter how many times I repeated it, I couldn\u2019t figure out what I was supposed to take away from it. How could you be anyone other than who you are? I put it from my mind.The difference between my fourth-grade-self and my present-self is I think I understand what the advice is getting at (and completely reject it).In my experience, the advice \u201cbe yourself\u201d oversimplifies the process of identity self-discovery to the point of being counterproductive.Personally, K-12 and college were full of poor judgment calls and a lack of clear identity. I was a straight-A student with a rebellious streak. I didn\u2019t know how to reconcile my feelings and behaviors into a neat little box. I felt like a phony. I was too many things at once, and stood for absolutely nothing. I wasn\u2019t sure what I cared about or what I valued.I had no idea who I was.This lack of identity was both troubling and motivating. When I graduated high school, I remember thinking that going to university was my chance to start fresh \u2014 I\u2019d settle on a nice, neat little identity and stick to it. The summer before college I resolved to 1) stop wearing makeup, 2) insist I was \u201ctotally obsessed\u201d with LOTR, and 3) become a nerdy-cute-sort-of-tomboy-ish girl. Yes. This was it. This was my identity. I was even gifted the Evenstar necklace by my college fling. This shit went deep.I kept up appearances for a while but still felt phony\u200a\u2014\u200aa poor man\u2019s Zooey Deschanel pixie dream girl.This feeling made me resent anyone who seemed to have their identity figured out. The sorority sisters who seemed legitimately thrilled to organize softball fundraisers for a charity. The Black Student Union folks who roused at the flagpoles listening intently to a speaker. Even the religious fanatic holding a \u201cThe End is Near\u201d sign in my college campus quad seemed to be more sure of himself than I was.Every self-help YouTube video I came across promised the solution for gaining self-esteem and security: \u201cBe Yourself!\u201d It was advertised like you could flip a switch and your problems would melt away. Only one flaw with this: how could I \u201cbe myself\u201d if I had absolutely no idea who I was or who I was supposed to be?In college I met someone in my Chemistry Lab and we began dating. He was older, dark, charming. He was irreverent with a dash of salty virulence, yet sweet. His presence caused me to reevaluate my manufactured identity, and feel a strong gravitational pull into his world. I abandoned my old identity in an attempt to become someone I thought was more authentic and complex. I picked up some of his quirks. I was groping for anything that would fill my (still empty) identity void. I convinced myself I was transforming into what would be my permanent, \u201creal\u201d self. I was excited at the possibility.Fast-forward to the end of my relationship with this guy \u2014 will spare the details \u2014 I slowly realized I had (again) zipped up a skin-suit that didn\u2019t fit my body. His natural pessimism and ironic tone (both which had originally seemed appealing in their foreignness) didn\u2019t come naturally to me.After college, I moved back to the Bay Area and joined a tech startup called Postmates.There was something intoxicating and transformative about being young, gainfully employed, and single in a big vibrant city. I went out to nightclubs alone multiple times a week, and bobbed my head to deep house wearing trendy-again 90's garb. There was a certain freedom in the lack of expectation from anyone in my immediate vicinity. Any day of the week I could choose to hang out in Dolores Park, crush it at work, or go backpacking. This new freedom gave me the space to sprawl out, reflect, and figure out what inspired me.I realized that for me to be myself, I had to discover myself. The idea began to take shape in my subconscious.I decided to try to find ways to find out who I was. Easy, right? I started by writing down simple, easily observable facts I knew to be true about myself (I was etching an outline that I would fill in with color later).Was I morning person? Yes. Did I like peanut butter? Yes. Did I wear socks to bed like a weirdo? Yes. Was I a 5'10\u201d brazilian model? Nope.I spent a few weeks drawing a new image of myself that felt more objective than before, and I felt slightly more comfortable in my own skin. I also decided that if certain traits I wanted to have (confidence, assertiveness) didn\u2019t come naturally to me it didn\u2019t mean I was a failure. I decided it was OK to practice the skills and traits I wanted to build every day, like a muscle.My experience is that the process of discovering who you are at different points in your life is 1) highly intentional 2) difficult and 3) time-consuming (but worth it). I want to share this experience in case it\u2019s helpful for others out there.So\u200a\u2014\u200aI think we should tell kids the truth: it\u2019s okay not to know who you are.It\u2019s okay not to know how to act\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s normal. Let\u2019s spend more time and energy discussing practical strategies to help others discover who they are and who they want to become.Written byWritten by","3512":"For as long as I can remember I have been trying out different diets hoping to find the magic potion that fixes all of my problems. Those \u201cproblems\u201d have changed through the years and along with it, my idea of healthy eating has evolved as well.For a long time, I simply wanted a diet that would make me lose weight. I fell victim to the unrealistic feminine images that are plastered on all the billboards. I thought if I could just lose enough weight to look like the models, I\u2019d be a happy girl.I bounced from diet to diet, all the while experimenting with new exercise programs, convinced the perfect combination was out there to be found. I have a magic number in my head of my \u201cideal weight\u201d. This number is based on nothing more than what I arbitrarily decided was a number I wouldn\u2019t be ashamed to say out loud if someone asked my weight. I was sure that with enough discipline and deprivation, I could reach this number. Once I hit that number on the scale, I could let go of the strict rules and harsh guidelines. Then I could relax.I now weigh 10 pounds over that magical arbitrary number and guess what?I\u2019m okay with it. It\u2019s taken years and years of struggle and self degradation, but I think I can finally say that I feel happy.Do I look the models we see in the fashion magazines? No.Do I wear a size 4 dress that I once thought would bring me joy? Not even close.So how did I get to this place that I dare to call contentment? A lot of trial and error. A lot of falling down and picking myself back up.But through it all, I learned some lessons about what it means to be healthy and how to make eating right part of a happy lifestyle. Deprivation and self degradation are not included. Here are a few guidelines that can help you reframe your eating habits and build a foundation for a lifelong healthy diet plan.Throughout high school and college and even into my late twenties, my goal was to get skinny and look like the fashion models. Eventually, as I slowly began to link my mood and energy levels to my eating habits, I realized that being \u201cskinny\u201d was not the ticket to happiness. A number on a scale does not equate to good health or even to feeling good.When I switched my focus to being healthy rather than some unattainable body image, it became far easier to maintain good eating habits. Here\u2019s why.Good health comes with other benchmarks for success, rather than just inches and pounds.My definition of good health consists of these factors:Notice that none of these benchmarks are dependent upon an arbitrary number. Yet they are all trackable.Along the way I have learned (and am still learning) what foods help to keep these markers on the plus side. If I am starting to get sweet cravings or thinking about desserts a lot, I know I have been eating too much sugar. Or maybe my energy is slipping late in the day because I ate too many carbs at lunch. When I notice the direct effects of what I eat on my mood and energy levels, I am far less tempted to eat those foods that don\u2019t make me feel great. Instead of focusing on foods I can\u2019t have, I am focusing on foods that help me feel good. And those foods, not coincidentally, are the same foods that will help me lose or maintain my weight.As I wrote earlier, I have experimented with all types of diets, from Atkins to low fat, to vegetarian to Paleo, to name just a few. I have done detoxes and cleanses hoping for a jump start to my best self. (I now believe that regular detoxing is a beneficial practice of any healthy lifestyle.) The problem with these programs was not the diet itself, but rather my approach to the diet. Aside from vegetarianism, I always thought of the diet as a means to an end. But unless I plan on getting to a point in life where I can stop eating all together, this way of thinking can only lead to failure.The way you eat has to be sustainable. If a diet is so restrictive that you can\u2019t maintain it long term, then it is not practical and not worth your time (unless you have very specific short term goals). Deprivation does not work. If after the initial acclimation period to a diet, you still feel deprived of something, this will only lead to binging later on.However, it is important to know yourself in this situation. Are you an abstainer or a moderator? Author Gretchen Rubin defines these terms on her website in this way:You\u2019re a moderator if you\u2026\u2013 find that occasional indulgence heightens your pleasure\u2013and strengthens your resolve\u2013 get panicky at the thought of \u201cnever\u201d getting or doing somethingYou\u2019re an abstainer if you\u2026\u2013 have trouble stopping something once you\u2019ve started\u2013 aren\u2019t tempted by things that you\u2019ve decided are off-limitsA moderator is someone who can be satisfied with eating just a little bit of something, whereas an abstainer is someone who finds it easier to just quit something cold turkey and never look back.Knowing which of these types you are can be a tremendous benefit to keeping healthy eating habits. I have discovered that for myself, I fall into a third category which is an abstainer who thinks she can be a moderator. I definitely get panicky at the thought of never being able to eat, say, chocolate ever again. Yet, at the same time, I have trouble stopping once I\u2019ve started. What seems to work best for me is to eliminate sweets but to make some planned exceptions. According to Gretchen Rubin, a planned exception is a way to break a habit without disrupting the good habit altogether. She elaborates by writing this:We\u2019re adults, we make the rules for ourselves, and we can mindfully choose to make an exception to a usual habit by planning that exception in advance.Ultimately, the best way to pursue healthy eating is to think about it as a lifestyle. Eating should be enjoyable and it should be nourishing. When you can see the impact food has on your mood, your energy, and your overall health, you are more apt to choose foods that have positive effects rather than negative ones\u2026even if those negative effect foods taste really good in the moment.Reframing your thinking about dieting and eating healthy is helpful as well. If you think about it as something you are doing just until you lose a certain amount of weight, you are setting yourself up for failure. You might lose weight initially, but if you don\u2019t plan on keeping the good habits that helped you get there, chances are you won\u2019t be able to keep the weight off.So instead of making a huge dietary overhaul, start small, with manageable, simple habits that serve as the foundation for lifelong healthy eating.Your body\u2019s needs are constantly changing. It is dealing with an abundance of stresses each and every day. There are emotional stresses, environmental stresses, physical stresses, etc. that your body is constantly adjusting to and fighting off. These stresses may cause your body to need more or less of certain nutrients in any given day. That\u2019s why some days eating what you normally eat works great and other days it\u2019s not quite right.Flexibility is an important ingredient in building a successful eating plan. Tune into your body\u2019s signals and hear what it is telling you. Be wise enough to let go of strict rules when your body may need something different. I struggled for two years on a vegetarian diet that wasn\u2019t working for me. I was hungry all the time and constantly thought about food. I was fatigued and lacked the energy I needed to get through the day. But I had a hard time accepting that my body needed meat. When I finally listened to my body\u2019s signals, I regained my energy and began to feel satisfied after eating my meals.Forcing your body into a restrictive or unsuitable diet because it worked for your best friend or coworker, is only going to set you back further.I believe in experimenting with foods and styles of eating, but it\u2019s important to allow yourself flexibility in those styles. Allow yourself to customize for your body and the specific needs it has. Be open and willing to hear the signals your body is sending you so you can adjust accordingly.Healthy eating does not have to be the struggle that it gets made out to be. It starts with defining what good health means to you. From there, it needs to be sustainable. You are not going for the quick fix. You want lifelong habits, so start small and build upwards. Finally, flexibility is your friend. Healthy eating is an evolving process. What I thought was healthy 10 years ago looks wildly different than what I think about healthy eating now.Be proactive in your health.Invest some time in it.Understand that healthy eating may not always equal fast and cheap.But if you want to perform well, feel good, and be happy, then isn\u2019t it worth the extra effort?Written byWritten by","3566":"I stumbled into the kitchen while rubbing the sleep out of my eyes. I grabbed the tea kettle and filled it with water while demonstrating yawns so big they could have touched my toes. Clumsily I found the dial for the burner and turned it on. Anxious to check on a project from the night before, I sat down at my computer. It shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal because I would hear the tea kettle whistle.It wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal if I had turned on the correct burner, or if I had cleaned out the cast iron skillet the night before. The night before we had brussel sprouts that were roasted in some bacon grease. Not the healthiest side dish, but deliciously yummy.So, there I was\u2026 (That\u2019s the beginning of every fantastic story if you\u2019re a member of the Akers family. We use that prompt to entertain each other and tell countless stories. Sorry for the brief interruption \u2014 Back to the story.)So there I was\u2026 checking on work from the previous night, Focus at Will in the earbuds, and in my own little world. It shouldn\u2019t have been a big deal because the tea kettle was set to whistle and call me back to attention. Instead the skillet from the night before was heating. My youngest said, \u201cHey Mom, there\u2019s a lot of smoke\u201d. It snapped me back to attention because nothing should have been smoking. I would have smelled the hot skillet, except for the three sinus surgeries that left my sense of smell altered. Upon arrival in the kitchen, less than 10 feet away, I picked up the skillet and transferred it to the sink as it erupted into flames.The girls freaked out and ran to their bedroom. My youngest was shouting that we needed to call 9\u20131\u20131. (The fire department visited her school the day before, teaching the students appropriate times for calling 9\u20131\u20131.) She said, \u201cThis is a fire, and for a fire we call 9\u20131\u20131\u201d! My husband arrived in the kitchen and retrieved the fire extinguisher from under the sink. The fire was out as quickly as it began, but the damage was done to my hand. Dust and soot covered the kitchen like a blanket.Multi-tasking creates scatter-brained people who can\u2019t focus on any one project until completion. We weren\u2019t wired to multi-task. At the risk of sounding \u201cold\u201d I\u2019ll say I remember phones being on the wall. When someone was on them the party on the other end got a busy signal. We weren\u2019t connected all the time. Multi-tasking requires a lot of extra decisions to be made. Do I answer this text message or ignore it? How do I respond to this? Do I continue what I am working on now or take a break?Had I not been multi-tasking that morning I would have noticed the wrong burner was turned on, but my attention was split between too many things, and my hand looks like this. It has taught me to focus.Okay, maybe not no multi-tasking, but certainly less multi-tasking. When I am deep in thought and my girls inundate me with requests I am famous for telling them that they have to pick one thing and do it well. I wish I had taken my own advice that morning.\u2026Sorry, that was a quick text\u2026 I\u2019m back.Completely reformed I am not, but I do pay attention when I am in the kitchen and maintain better focus for \u201cimportant\u201d things.People don\u2019t really multi-task, they just hop sequentially from task to task and perform each one less effectively than if they did the tasks one at a time.This London study suggests multitasking makes us dumber than losing a night\u2019s sleep or smoking pot. And, electronic multitasking is worse than other kinds. Instead of choosing one task, we choose them all. We don\u2019t prioritize well. We open another screen, click another link. And, it\u2019s harder than ever to make decisions.When is the last time you went out to dinner with friends or family? Likely, the cell phones came out before you decided what to eat. Part of the problem is that we have too much information. Because everything is searchable, we believe everything is worth searching. We are paralyzed by our options. Some things might be better off not knowing.Is multi-tasking a growing habit we need to extinguish? If so how will you gain focus and prioritize?Like this piece?

It runs in my family so I was never ashamed of it, knowing it is simply a chemical imbalance in my brain.But I hate the word depression. For those who suffer from clinical depression, this word doesn\u2019t adequately describe what a depressed person feels like. Most people think depression means sadness, and because of the ridiculousness of the English language, it does. But clinical depression is not sadness.Clinical depression is more like the Great Depression. There is a lack, a deficit, a shortage. Clinical depression is a lack of emotion, of feelings. You don\u2019t feel sad, you feel nothing. Feelings are opinions about what is happening around you. If you have no feelings, you have no opinion about life, and you lose interest in the things you have no opinion about. Depressed people are basically chronically bored with life and everything in it. There is no meaning. Nothing makes them happy or sad. There is no reason to do anything when you are in the throes of a depressive episode.Every single thing is hard when you have depression. You just don\u2019t care. It\u2019s like being forced to go to a boring party with people you don\u2019t know after a long day at a job you hate.Writer Andrew Solomon said during his TED talk, \u201cThe opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality.\u201d Depressed people don\u2019t feel. There is no life in them. Ally Brosh (the cartoonist of Hyperbole and a Half) describes her feelings when she is depressed as dead fish. They are not missing or hiding or sick. They are dead. My sister describes her depression as a three day old helium balloon. I describe mine as feeling scooped out, hollow, just a body. There is nothing inside me.That\u2019s why a lot of depressed people sleep. There is literally nothing better to do. When I was in the throes of a depressive episode, I remember having terrible insomnia because I was actually afraid of how tired I was. I felt like I had been dosed with anesthesia. My limbs were heavy and I spent all day and night in bed because it was too hard to get up. I felt dead inside. The only reason I didn\u2019t end it all was because of my family. I would lie in bed thinking about how each person in my family would react and what would happen to them. I already felt like a waste of space and didn\u2019t want to disappoint my family even further. Any reason will do when it comes to finding one to keep going.A lot of depressed people don\u2019t get help. It\u2019s too hard. The best way to help a depressed person is to help them get help. Call their insurance company and see which doctors are in their network. Set up an appointment for them and then drive them there. Ask if they want you in there to help answer questions. Those with depression have trouble making memories because oftentimes there are no feelings associated with them so it\u2019s like memorizing the phone book. I personally have no recollection of my time spent in the emergency psych ward. My mom said she drove me there and she\u2019s not a liar so I guess it happened. And don\u2019t expect any gratitude from them; they don\u2019t feel any. They don\u2019t feel anything.Zoloft has helped me a lot. Finding the right antidepressants can be tricky but I was lucky enough that depression runs in my family so they did all the hard work for me. My mom found Zoloft works for her and I found it works for me. But antidepressants are not the cure. In that same TED Talk, Andrew Solomon talks about how his antidepressants didn\u2019t make him happy, but it did make it easier to make a sandwich. I love my Zoloft. I like to think of him as a really good friend who convinces me to get out of the house every now and then. But Zoloft on its own doesn\u2019t make me happy. It just makes it possible for me to experience happiness.Just because Zoloft makes it possible for me to be happy, doesn\u2019t mean it does. The neural pathways that depression carved through my brain are deep and familiar roads. My first reaction to any new stimuli is that it\u2019s stupid and meaningless. But because of Zoloft, I am able to get out of that rut and explore what each experience means to me. It takes a lot of hard work. I am currently in therapy, my third time. I take supplements like Vitamin D and magnesium citrate. I meditate with the Headspace app. I have to write incredibly detailed to do lists (with gems such as \u201cwake up\u201d and \u201cgo outside for ten minutes\u201d) or I will just lie in bed all day. I start my day with an energy drink or coffee to get my energy up and I don\u2019t drink alcohol anymore because it made my depression worse. My period is especially hard for me. No matter what I do, I will sink into a depressive episode and I just have to ride it out.Dealing with depression is like pushing a boulder uphill. You can\u2019t just \u201cget the ball rolling\u201d; it is a constant struggle and you can\u2019t take a day off. It takes a lot of work just to feel \u201chuman,\u201d and I feel like I exhaust myself for what appears to be so little. Or, I can do nothing and the results can be dramatic enough to wind up in the psych emergency ward. The latter can seem tempting, especially when other people belittle your depression. Telling someone to \u2018get over\u2019 their depression or \u2018just get up\u2019 or \u2018just smile\u2019 or \u2018just try\u2019 is like telling someone to \u2018just win\u2019 a marathon and not caring that they\u2019ve just run for 24 hours straight. A non-depressed person thinks a depressed person who watches TV all day is lazy. A depressed person is proud they made it to the couch. But when someone tells them they are lazy, they see that huge triumph and realize it was worthless, so again, what\u2019s the point? They have no confidence in themselves and then someone comes along and tells them that their best isn\u2019t worth shit. When I am in a depressive episode, I find myself wishing there was some physical sign. I want to point to a huge bruise on my chest and say, \u201cSee?\u201d to all who doubt me.Dealing with clinical depression makes me stronger. Fighting an outside force is easy because you have something to attack, an enemy that must be defeated. With depression, my thoughts are my enemy. I have to fight differently when I\u2019m fighting myself. I can\u2019t attack blindly like some kid pushing all the buttons on the controller. It has to be more nuanced. It\u2019s the difference between water boarding my enemy versus sitting down and finding some common ground. I\u2019ve found I\u2019ve developed incredible empathy and sympathy towards myself and others.It\u2019s not all bad. I\u2019ve come to appreciate my depression. I\u2019m incredibly grateful for anything that makes me feel something. Pain and sadness are actually good things because it means I\u2019m alive. Joy takes my breath away. My depression has also made me funny. In the deep throes of my depression, I am a clinical scientist examining the human species around me and I\u2019ve come away with some spot-on observations.Most people do things they don\u2019t want to do all the time. I find I am almost physically incapable. Depression strips away the bullshit from my life. I only do the things I want to do with the people I want to do them with. I\u2019ve been called a bitch, told I am rude, and ignored. It used to bother me, but now I see these people are searching for meaning just like me.Most difficult job I ever had was working at Target. I worked with people in their mid 50s who have been there their whole lives. I knew I couldn\u2019t do that. I knew that living a mediocre life would kill me. And I knew that I would be the one to put myself out of my own misery. And so I quit my job, moved back into my parents\u2019 house, and started my writing career. If I didn\u2019t have depression pushing me, I probably never would have done it. We all have dreams. The consequences for not pursuing those dreams leads to regret. For most people, that\u2019s the end of it. For depressed people, that regret could kill them.And so, I hate the word depression. I\u2019m not sad. Depression just makes it impossible for me to ignore that empty spot inside us all.Written byWritten by","3602":"At first the silence was deafening. But then the chatter in my mind seemed to pick up the slack of the quiet space around me. After awhile, when my mind began to settle, the silence was liberating. This was my experience during my first weekend silent meditation retreat in Newbury, MA.I was there to practice mindfulness meditation with 19 other fellow meditators. We were to keep noble silence for the duration of the program. The Insight Meditation Society defines noble silence as,\u201ca quieting of the body and voice that helps cultivate a calm and peaceful retreat environment.\u201dIt is used to deepen concentration and awareness as well as disciplining speech to cultivate kindness and compassion.Initially, the silence felt awkward. Our first meal was eaten together in a beautiful room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the colorful fall foliage trees that surrounded the retreat center. We spooned breakfast onto our plates and took seats facing the windows hoping to avoid the awkwardness of facing each other in silence. The awkwardness gave way quickly for me. Soon I felt permission to fully enjoy and concentrate on my food without feeling the pressure of having to make small talk to strangers.During the periods of meditation, the silence felt a little more normal. Of course that is when my mind became the loudest. It would race between the birds chirping and the occasional person shifting in their seat, while simultaneously spewing out random desires, thoughts, and stories desperately tempting me to cling on and enjoy the ride.The silence eventually had a calming effect on my mind. As the desire for distraction faded, the ease of awareness settled in. I noticed the beauty in the soft sounds of nature. I noticed how repetitive the birds were. And I noticed my mind start thinking about lunch and when the bell was going to ring. This was the restless mind coming back.After a full day of silence and finally settling into the calmness that it promised, the end of the evening circled back to the awkwardness that began the program. I was getting a ride back to the residence from two of my fellow retreat goers but we were bound by the noble silence oath. After a day living in my head, I was curious to know what the others had experienced and how they were feeling. And at the same time, part of me was relieved again from the pressure of making conversation.The silence began to show me just how much energy goes into speaking. Even when I\u2019m not speaking, I\u2019m often scouring my brain for something to speak about. Being free from that pressure was liberating.On the other hand, I did experience some frustration to not feeling free to ask all the questions I wanted to the teacher. This frustration dissipated when I began to realize that my questions were eventually answered in my own practice. Most questions I had were focused around clarification of the practice or wondering how to do it correctly. I eventually realized that I could find my own way by tuning into the silence and letting go of expectations. Without my asking, the teacher told us that many people come to meditation trying to do it right and get good fast. Or they are hoping to attain some record-breaking success. But the goal of meditation is not to keep leveling up. It is simply to practice being present and accepting whatever comes with neutrality and equanimity.The silence also taught me that clarity of mind does not have to mean clarity of thought. Language can be cumbersome and inadequate. As someone who writes, this was a hard pill to swallow. My medium is words, so to have experiences beyond words presents a challenge.But that\u2019s okay. I like a challenge. Some experiences in life are meant to be just that: experienced. It\u2019s not necessary to put them into words and analyze them with restrictive language.Clarity of mind sees a grander picture. Awareness breaks down the limits that words impose. Silence invites a new type of communication experience. Our modern world is invested in the thinking mind and values the cerebral thought process. But our bodies can communicate in powerful ways if we just focus our attention to it.The first instruction we were given in our meditation practice was to focus on the body and when the attention wandered off, the moment we noticed, we focus back on the body. The body became the anchor for calming the mind. The mind can be racing in a million directions, but by continuously bringing it back to the stilled body, the mind eventually relents and quiets itself.One way to direct the focus is by doing a body scan where you intentionally focus on your toes for several minutes at a time and work your way up through each body part all the way to your head. Ed Halliwell writes about the body scan in his article The 7 Qualities of Mindfulness Trained in the Body Scan,Training attention in a body scan is a bit like doing resistance work in the gym \u2014 it takes some effort, but it cultivates strength and flexibility. Remember, each time you practice a body scan, you are strengthening the muscles of mindfulness.This training helps us develop the sensory experiences that are beyond words and language. It gives us the opportunity to get out of our heads and hone our innate instincts and abilities. Halliwell elaborates on this idea of embodiment.The body senses rather than thinks, so, by allowing body sensations to be felt, we can drop into a fuller sensory palette. Living from our bodies, we tune into a mode of perceiving that\u2019s more centered, grounded and directly in touch with the world around us, rather than always getting caught up in concepts.It\u2019s these concepts and the value placed on thinking that robs us of the signals and experiences our bodies are communicating on a daily basis. How often have you mindlessly eaten your way through a bag of chips only to discover you are stuffed and feeling sick? By paying attention, you notice what cues your body is giving you that you are full. You begin to notice when your taste buds are satisfied and no longer getting pleasure from the taste you are eating. During a body scan you begin to notice that sensations, good or bad, are constantly coming and going. Instead of resisting or fighting a painful or unpleasant sensation, mindfulness teaches you to accept it and allow it to be.We live in a society that is bombarding us with noise of all kinds. Our attention is pushed and pulled and dragged along for any number of tasks, activities, and distractions that come up in our day. This chaotic noise has generated a fear of silence. The thought of sitting still in a quiet space is enough to send most people into a panic. We fear that we\u2019re wasting precious time that we could be accomplishing, achieving and striving.But I invite you to consider the opposite. Cultivating quiet in the mind will enrich and enhance your experience of living. It will instill a sense of gratitude for the details we miss when we race through the moment. Instead of fearing silence, I now fear racing through life never really noticing what I\u2019ve experienced. I fear that my constant need to look ahead at what\u2019s next is stealing away the beauty and joy of the present moment.The great thing about mindfulness practice is that it can be incorporated into your daily activities without needing to dedicate solid blocks of your day to it. It\u2019s simple to find little moments throughout your day to sprinkle in a bit of mindfulness. Here\u2019s a few ideas to get you started:There are countless opportunities to practice mindfulness in your day. Making space for silence is something we can all benefit from in our lives. Even just a few short minutes of quiet each day will begin to cultivate greater awareness to the present moment. This is where life happens. This is where we find joy beyond external circumstances.Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and InstagramSign up for my free newsletter and I\u2019ll send you my latest discoveries in mindfulness, happiness, and creating a balanced life.Written byWritten by","3629":"In 2011 I was an organiser of a big summer event in London called Meditation in the Park. Another yoga teacher and I were doing the event in collaboration with the ecologist who maintained the park and long-term local resident who was a jovial and well-respected man and local cause supporter. His name was Steve and he had a wonderful, generous and open-hearted spirit, but for the sake of this story it need be known that this whole yoga\/meditation thing was a bit new to him\u2026My fellow yogini and I weren\u2019t the proselytising types and generally kept the details of what we did for our practice on the quiet. But after a while of working together there was a day when Steve finally broached the topic: \u201cSo what do you do when you meditate?\u201dWe replied that we get up early, do this, do that, then before bed do some more, and so on\u2026 He seemed perhaps a little shocked at the rigour of our routine. Either way, his retort was priceless: \u201cMy idea of meditation is sitting down by the docks on a Saturday morning with my fishing pole and a six pack of beer!\u201dHa! Truly classic, Steve. But beneath the light humour there was no sarcasm. He was genuinely serious! In his mind, whatever he believed \u201cmeditation\u201d to be, I believe that experience very much gave it to him.The moment passed with a bit of shared laughter, but later on I began to ponder: \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Or perhaps more to the point: \u201cIs that really meditation?\u201dYou might spiritually bypass the question by saying \u201cto each his own\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s his truth\u201d or something like that, but let\u2019s look at it this way: If that experience qualifies as meditation, then would you be prepared to adopt that practice? A 40 day sadhana perhaps??My gut feeling said that something was missing from the picture. Even letting the whole alcohol thing slip by, something told me that this practice did not have much overlap with what I did in my daily meditations. Fishing alone on a sunny morning drinking beer might very well be relaxing but it just wasn\u2019t the same as meditation. But wait! Maybe that\u2019s it\u2026.It suddenly dawned on me: I was correct in my assessment that the experience Steve described was not meditation because it was something else\u2026It was relaxation. It also occurred to me that this is a very common misconception: The idea that meditation is somehow related to relaxation. I would say that they are opposites.In order to understand why, let\u2019s consult the writings of the 5th century mystic, Patanjali, whose Yoga Sutras is a profoundly concise treatise describing the purpose, aspects and stages of a yoga practice (fundamental reading for all keen students). In Yoga Sutras, Patanjali describes meditation as a state of being called \u201cdhyana\u201d. He says to achieve this stage, one first has to go through \u201cdharana\u201d, which translates roughly to \u201cconcentration\u201d.But wait a minute! You might say you concentrate all day long at work and that doesn\u2019t feel very meditative??\u201cConcentration\u201d, here, does not mean \u201cthinking hard\u201d. Concentration, in this context, is something you do, not with your thoughts, but with your awareness. When you bring your awareness to the flow of your breath, the tip of your nose, or the sound of a mantra you are \u201cconcentrating\u201d. You are focusing the ray beam of your consciousness into a single point through the lens of awareness to increase its potency. Think: orange juice from concentrate.By concentrating our consciousness a number of good things begin to happen. First, we get back in touch with our inner nature, the one underneath all the roles we play. This gives us a deep feeling of acknowledgement and renewed sense of connection. Our true self knows the answers to our deepest questions. In meditation we get closer to that inner voice.Second, we detach ourselves from the influence of the never-ending stream of thoughts from the mind. It\u2019s like we are being tossed about in the river rapids, and suddenly we grab a rock and hold on tight. Some people think that in order to meditate you have to be thoughtless. Actually, one key purpose of mediation is to clean out the thoughts so that they don\u2019t overflow into our subconscious and unconscious mind where they become destructive. To clean them out, we don\u2019t fight them, but instead, allow them. We observe them but don\u2019t get caught up in their tidal currents.But why then, if meditation isn\u2019t relaxation, do we always feel calmer after meditating? Well, this is precisely because they are opposites. It\u2019s like going to the gym and working out all your muscles. Afterwards you can\u2019t help but relax. You needn\u2019t even try.So which is better, relaxation or meditation? Meditation is clearly the more en vogue at the moment, but I would suggest that the often neglected relaxation is at least equally as important to a healthy human life, especially in these high octane times.We all know deep relaxation as the usual sivasana at the end of a yoga class or maybe a warm bath, or a massage, but another important facet of deep relaxation includes activities that we might call play \u2014 a skill we once were all experts at! This kind of relaxation includes dancing, cooking, gardening, music making, or day dreaming on a long walk.In these activities we allow the mind to wander freely, preferably with some positive external stimulus \u2014 e.g. sunshine, nature, good music \u2014 so the mind wanders in good directions. In these moments there is nothing to worry about, no one to keep track of, no image to uphold. Here\u2019s where Steve\u2019s sunshine and fishing comes in. It\u2019s a break from his normal demands and routines, a place where his only purpose is to be. I\u2019ll bet he doesn\u2019t even care if he catches any fish!Meditation and relaxation are the Yin and Yang of the inner workout, two basic requirements of a healthy human maintenance routine. They are the \u201cshower\u201d and \u201cbrush your teeth\u201d of the inner psyche! Do you include them both? Does your meditation involve any focus or concentration? How often do you \u201cpractice\u201d deep relaxation? What would you do if you had a day to yourself, no tasks allowed, no yoga allowed, no friends or family? How would you play? Why not make it happen\u2026weekly even? In the meantime, below is a very powerful deep relaxation technique to try\u2026.Set the shower to a warm temperature (not too hot). Kneel down in the shower and, if you are able, place your head on the shower floor and arms at your sides (child\u2019s pose). Be comfortable and close your eyes. Allow the water to run down your back. Any length of time is great but try 11\u201331 minutes for a very powerful healing experience.Written byWritten by","3639":"Get ready to get real.Order-loving Saturn returns to his Spartan home of Capricorn on Dec. 19\/20, 2017.After the chaos of recent years \u2014 and the wild, fiery frenzy of 2017 \u2014 this move will hit with a jolt. It\u2019s as if an alarm goes off and we\u2019re awakening under pizza boxes and beer bottles, wondering what the heck happened and how we got there. Then realizing we\u2019re late for work.And work we will, on the job and in our personal lives.Sound depressing? It is sobering. But it\u2019s also good news, really it is. Saturn in Capricorn holds wondrous potential for carving out some security and making something of yourself. Eventually. But you have to work. (That word again!)Saturn\u2019s Zodiac pilgrimage takes 30 years; he spends three years or so in each of the 12 signs. The ringed planet travels through Capricorn from Dec. 20, 2017, until late 2020. However, he\u2019s not retrograding into the previous sign to clean up lingering business as he often does. Once he\u2019s in Capricorn, he\u2019s there for the entire tour of duty.He was last in Capricorn from February 1988 to February 1991. What became serious then? How were you called on to apply yourself? Thinking back to those years will give an idea of the kinds of issues and challenges coming for you now.Saturn is the guy who wants you to go to bed early, eat your vegetables, pay your bills on time, keep your word and be an upstanding, conscientious and, above all, productive member of society.In other words, he\u2019s the party pooper of the sky. The cosmic taskmaster. The great teacher. The ruler-wielding nun standing by your desk ready to rap your wrist at the slightest provocation.He is, basically, the planet of adulting.When he goes home to Capricorn, it\u2019s as if we\u2019re getting a double dose of Saturn. Capricorn governs the measurables of Saturn\u2019s influence: worldly ambition, achievement and status, foundations, institutions and long-range goals. No escaping any of those for the foreseeable future.While Saturn is in Capricorn, we\u2019ll be called upon to act responsibly and to commit. This often occurs through burdens, delays, obstacles, restrictions, separations and a generally heavy atmosphere that forces us to take the affected area of life seriously. Order and structure result, either because we encounter them or we create them.During his last three years in Sagittarius, Saturn prompted a lot of talk \u2014 arguing and pontificating while he demonstrated the real-world ramifications of belief systems and laws. In Capricorn, it\u2019s time for concrete action to bring ideas into tangible reality.Saturn expects hard work, rewards it when you buckle down and exacts penalties when you don\u2019t.Accountability is his religion. If you fall short or misuse your influence, there will be ramifications and consequences. They may take a while \u2014 Saturn is no hurry \u2014 but they will arrive.He won\u2019t coddle, either. He won\u2019t, for example, tie your shoelaces; that\u2019s for the Moon. He\u2019ll show you how to do it, though, and watch while you give it a shot. Practical lessons are his specialty, and they generally have staying power. Often because we have to go over them a time or two before we get them.We may balk at his unyielding insistence that we act our age. Ultimately, it\u2019s a very good thing indeed. Because, ultimately, Saturn is our friend. Play by the rules and he will deliver. Life will become more manageable.And that is especially welcome now. Look back at the past few years. What words come to mind? Not \u201cstable,\u201d \u201csecure,\u201d \u201ccalm,\u201d right? Help is at hand.With change agents Uranus and Pluto ripping up the landscape of life since 2012 or so, we\u2019ve been existing in the midst of chaos and rubble. Energetically and symbolically. (Raise your hand if you\u2019ve had good intentions about straightening up some mess or another but have not yet found the time. I thought as much.)Now we can get moving with the prospect of actually making progress. A platform has taken shape during the chaos. (It\u2019s there; look for it.) We have the motivation to clear it off, or at least clear enough space to walk.We also have awareness of the direction we\u2019d like to go. Maybe not specifics yet, but a sense, involving how it would feel to express ourselves more fully. That\u2019s been flaring up all year, with the fire eclipses, north node in Leo and grand trines. One benefit of the chaos has been creating an opening for us to head that way.Saturn in Capricorn is bringing the environment to move from chaos, sensations and theory to physical manifestation. Here we can set goals, draw up a game plan, make a spread sheet (Saturn loves spreadsheets!) and begin project-managing life.We may not see the benefits immediately. Keep plugging away, though, and before you know it, you\u2019ll be halfway there. Well, maybe not halfway. Maybe not that quickly. But you\u2019ll see progress.What to do to improve your relationship with Saturn is simple. Actually doing it is where the real work comes in. But the reward of a better, more contented and productive life will be worth it.Take one step at a time.Saturn in Capricorn requires split vision: One eye on the goal and the other on what\u2019s right in front of you. Then focus on what\u2019s nearby. Once you\u2019re clear on the direction, step by step, inch by inch is how this energy works.This combo promotes incremental progress. Let that truth guide your actions. Finish the task at hand before going on to the next. Follow the instructions teachers gave during standardized tests. Don\u2019t rush. Check your work before turning the page. Clean up after yourself. Check your work area for your belongings before you leave.Be selective.You can\u2019t do everything. Consider projects, ideas, invitations and opportunities from a calculating perspective: Do I really want this? Now? Would I enjoy what it takes? Would it get me somewhere I want to be? Is it important? Is it a diversion? Funneling effort toward a few chosen will get you further than throwing your attention and energies willy-nilly.The rest of the world may be engaging in short-attention-span theater, but that\u2019s no sane way for you to run your life. Not now. Saturn has your back on this: Say no.Honor walls and delays.Sometimes the best-laid plans hit walls. Sometimes people say no or unavailable. Sometimes your time table is different from the rest of the world\u2019s. Direct your attention and energies elsewhere. Don\u2019t hit your head against walls. Don\u2019t hammer away at delays. They may \u2014 likely will \u2014 turn out to be godsends, when you get further up the mountain.Pace yourself.You can\u2019t get to the finish line in a flash. And we\u2019re all in this nose-to-the-grindstone vibe for years. Treat life as a marathon, not a sprint.View your body and being as assets, tools, vehicles, whatever label you want, as long as you reframe your thinking of them as useful, valuable and necessary. They are getting heavy wear and tear now. Act with awareness of that.You wouldn\u2019t keep driving your car if it ran out of gas or oil, or it overheated, or a tire blew off. (Well, you might try, but you wouldn\u2019t go far.) Pushing your body beyond its limits makes as much sense as mistreating your car, which is to say: little. And the damage could be enormous.When warning signs of exhaustion or overload hit, pay attention and respond. You cannot operate full-tilt 10\u201312 hours a day, seven days a week. (That schedule\u2019s unlikely, you say? Just wait.) Bodies need sleep and fuel and occasionally quiet and stillness.Your spirit needs a break now and then, too: A laugh. A walk outdoors. A conversation with a friend (with physical contact, please, via phone \u2014 so you hear a voice \u2014 or face to face). A stretch of deliberate non-productivity when you aren\u2019t pursuing any goal at all but are simply being.Don\u2019t wait till illness flattens you because you\u2019ve worn yourself out. Being responsible also means being pro-active. Schedule downtime. Block out hours on your calendar if that\u2019s what it takes for you to follow through.In this atmosphere, you may find that too much socializing actually adds pressure. Take a tip from a real-life Capricorn, who balanced a full-time job and post-divorce dating by dedicating one night a week to vegging at home. Unwaveringly.Celebrate progress.Saturn rewards diligence. So should you. Stock up on gold stars, and give yourself one for every milestone. Those could be major tasks completed or #lifegoals achieved; some days, it could be merely leaving bed and facing the day. Small wins count, too, especially if they confronted something unpleasant or daunting. Especially if they handled something you\u2019ve been putting off.Manage Your ExpectationsSaturn sees reality as it is, not at you wish it to be. Unvarnished. It will not bring quick fixes.But it will tamp down on turmoil and chaos, but likely won\u2019t stop them. We\u2019ll still have rubble. We\u2019ll still have challenges.

By the time I was 23, I had a distinct image in my head that symbolized the progress I was making on becoming the \u201cbest\u201d version of myself. The image was a paper doll outline, and every time I felt I accomplished a \u201cshould\u201d I mortared in a little brick. The bricks started at the feet and made their way up.I lived with this image in my head for years and managed to brick my way up to just about mid-chest level. There, the bricks stopped. Every so often, I would try to add a new brick only to discover that it somehow disappeared the next time I wanted to add a new brick. Somehow, someway, the brick wall stalled at that point. I felt frustrated and defeated. I could never be good enough.People are always more perfect when viewed from a distance.I finally stopped working on filling in the doll, understanding that I was inherently broken and unable to be the person I imagined becoming: Someone who had it all together. A person with a \u201cgood\u201d career at a \u201cgood\u201d company, successfully living on their own, saving money while planning for retirement, always perfectly coiffed and styled with perfect makeup, who had the right answers in the right moment and phrased them just right.In other words, just like other women I admired and how I imagined they were. People are always more perfect when viewed from a distance.It was an impossible standard to live up to.Even once I was able to recognize that important point, I still couldn\u2019t let go of the paper doll image in my head and what it represented. My failure. My incompetence.Those \u201cshoulds\u201d laid heavily on my shoulders, weighing me down with my disappointments and inabilities. I didn\u2019t see them for what they truly were: someone else\u2019s expectations placed upon me without my permission.\u201cShoulds\u201d are boundary-crossers. When someone \u201cshoulds\u201d on us, they place an expectation upon us that may not be realistic for where \u2014 and who \u2014 we are at that moment.The real problem is when we adopt these external \u201cshoulds\u201d for ourselves. When we are living paycheck-to-paycheck and struggling to put food on the table and gas in the car, saving ten percent is not a realistic expectation. And yet, too often, we feel guilty for not doing what we know we \u201cshould.\u201dWhen we choose, we cast off guilt.I first learned this point when I attended a sales training offered by a company I worked for. In walked Bob Gregoire, a Sandler Sales trainer and consultant, and a few things he shared across those days really hit home with me.He gave us permission to cast off the \u201cshoulds,\u201d suggesting we banish the word from our vocabulary. \u201cShoulds\u201d hold us back and constrain us. Instead, he guided, opt for a choice. Choosing is empowering. \u201cI choose to save ten percent of my income\u201d resonates very differently in my body than \u201cI should save ten percent of my income.\u201dWhen we choose, we cast off guilt. When we hit an obstacle with our choosing (say, an unexpected expense), we can make a different choice. I can choose to put new tires on my car and forego saving this month, or I can choose to dip into my savings, or I can choose to take public transportation until I have enough cash to pay for the tires and still save. In replacing \u201cshoulds\u201d with choices, we become more flexible in our decision-making and free ourselves from guilt.I cast off everything I knew I \u201cshould\u201d do and I \u201cshould\u201d be and became a blank slate of wants.Choosing means understanding our desires and our dreams. I desire to get off the financial roller coaster, and to do so, I choose to save every month. I desire to have a stable and healthy romantic relationship, so I choose to attend therapy and change some of my relational behaviors. I dream of owning my own business and I choose to be underemployed so I have the time and the emotional energy to make that dream come true.I dream. I desire. I choose.(I don\u2019t know about you and your experience in reading these last few paragraphs, but I went from being stressed out over all those \u201cshoulds\u201d to relaxed over the power of choice.)After the first day of training, I went home and did something I\u2019d never done before. I took out a few sheets of paper and went about the process of designing my life.If I lived my life in my way, what would it look like? I spent four hours plugging away at it, tweaking, modifying, exploring, defining. For the first time in my life, I cast off everything I knew I \u201cshould\u201d do and I \u201cshould\u201d be and became a blank slate of wants.The paper doll vanished.As I started living out this new life, I became aware of how deeply the word \u201cshould\u201d permeated my daily life. I started discovering little \u201cshoulds\u201d hiding in odd places of my life. One of the most interesting was one around my eating habits. I discovered that I \u201cshould\u201d finish all the food on my plate, even if it tastes disgusting or I\u2019m full. Each newly-uncovered \u201cshould\u201d was examined and explored, then cast off or chosen. With each choice, a new layer of guilt was cast off.I dream. I desire. I choose.There was another benefit for me, too. I had a newly-found ability to erect and maintain relational boundaries. When a family member told me I \u201cshould\u201d do something, I knew right away if it fit within the framework of the new life I was building for myself.I had permission to say, \u201cThanks for the advice; I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d and then immediately cast it off. The obligation to take on that \u201cshould\u201d melted away. I stopped letting people \u201cshould\u201d all over me.My life today is not the life I designed for myself eight years ago and that\u2019s wonderful. Circumstances changed; my desires changed. And each time, I was able to look at the situation and make a choice: stick to the original plan or make a change. I never expected to take a sabbatical from my career, and here I am. I never expected to move to a more rural area, and I love it. I didn\u2019t foresee a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or to become a Christian, yet each step was a choice and not a should.The process is not perfect and every so often I do an exercise to find and excise the \u201cshoulds\u201d living in my life. Each time, I find it freeing and energizing. It refocuses me and helps me make sure I\u2019m living out my priorities. Learning to cast off the \u201cshoulds\u201d is one of the top 10 gifts I\u2019ve ever received.Hi there! I\u2019m Teresa Col\u00f3n, and I live with bipolar disorder. I write out of my experiences with the disorder and what I\u2019ve learned as I\u2019ve walked my road to mental health.

Americans like to focus on self, but let\u2019s not discount our global friends in Finland, France, Germany and Japan who say they feel the same pain. In January, likely you\u2019ll be wondering\u2026 What have I done? The holidays are spent in the moment of good tidings and lots of delicious food, but leave you wondering what you could have done different to avoid weight gain. Approaching the holidays with foresight instead of hindsight can make a big difference. Let\u2019s start by busting a myth you probably believe.Most people gain 7\u201310 lbs over the holiday season. It\u2019s a widely believed myth and it\u2019s not true. It may feel like you\u2019ve gained a lot of weight. The pants feel tight and become hard to button. You probably feel sluggish, irritable and anxious as a result of indulgence. The extra pounds put on between Halloween and Christmas can take up to 5 months to lose.The holiday season means different things to different people. It is loosely defined as mid-November through mid-January. The holidays come around once a year and everyone wants to feel special. Eat special. Drink special. All those allowances lead to a perception of gaining a lot of weight. During the 6\u20138 week binge most people gain 1\u20132 lbs, not 5 lbs or more. And, the good news is that most people reduce the weight they have gained very quickly after the holidays are over.This study by The Institute of Health suggests people don\u2019t gain as much weight as they think they do.Nearly 200 adult participants are weighed before the holidays, during the holidays, after the holidays, and again in Spring to Fall of the following year. The net gain is 1\u20132 lbs.Now that we\u2019ve busted the myth we\u2019re ready to deal with the reality of the situation and start the New Year in a better place. Hopefully a place that doesn\u2019t have you running for a gym membership in January only to stop using it in February. That is how most gyms make profit.If you\u2019re one of the few who really do go to these gyms, you end up getting a great deal. All the people who are at home sitting on the couch are essentially subsidizing your membership, allowing you to pay way less than what your gym services actually cost.Why are people so susceptible to this arrangement, year after year after year? Probably because the New Year is a great time to reprioritize with good intentions. But while gyms may take advantage of our good intentions, they often do so with our permission. Many people often want to be locked into an annual gym contract, believing that paying a big sum up front will guilt them into going to the gym later.You probably only have a couple of pounds to lose, If the season meant more merriment than usual it\u2019s time to get back on track.Practice any of the following with regularity and you will choose well to eliminate at least some holiday weight gain:There are a multitude of diets to choose from. There are a weight loss plans with scales and points, celebrity diets, no carb diets\u2026 the list goes on. Preferences and food sensitivities make choosing a diet nearly impossible as a one-fits-all approach.Nutrition and health experts put their heads together to create a list of 38 best and worst diets. The DASH diet receives high marks for the sixth year running. Highly mentioned are the Mediterranean, and the Mind diets. Diets judged as poor performers are Atkins, Paleo, Dukan, and Whole30 diets. Here\u2019s the complete list.Most diets are a short-term solution. They require a high level of intensity and are not successful for long term change. Let\u2019s look at other options for lifestyle changes.There are a plethora of detox treatments available. You can enlist the help of a 3-day detox, or 21-day detox. Too many holiday sweets? A sugar detox might help.Are you stressed from holiday parties, events, and family members? It\u2019s time to break down the cortisol that hangs on to extra weight around the waistline. There are almost as many detox options as there are diet choices. Here\u2019s a quick one: If you want to slough off toxins and burn fat add some lemon juice to lukewarm or warm water to start your day.Easy; right?Drink it 30 minutes before you ingest anything else to wake up your body and get it ready to burn fat.Here\u2019s a recipe with three simple ingredients:Boost again at midday if you are sluggish.Just move.Start simply, if exercise doesn\u2019t sound like a blood pumping good time. Take a brisk morning walk around the neighborhood before hitting the shower to start your day.Not an early bird? Make it an after-dinner stroll or power walk.Pick an activity you enjoy like swimming, dancing, kickboxing, cycling, and have fun.There are plenty of free apps to get you moving in the comfort of your home without a gym, specialized equipment, or an audience. Find your favorite app and block time on your calendar. Moving is as easy as spending less time on social media and using the device in your pocket.If you work in an office setting, nix the elevator and take the stairs. Or, email less frequently and walk over to a coworker\u2019s desk to ask a question.Make it a priority.You schedule meetings and conference calls because they\u2019re important. Schedule time to take care of you \u2014 You are even more important.Be accountable to a workout buddy, or have someone check in for your progress report on a regular basis.It\u2019s easier to eat healthy when processed foods and added sugars are eliminated.Stay out of the aisles while grocery shopping. Shop the perimeter of the store for real food and leave the processed food on the shelves.Read labels. The ingredients highest on the ingredient list have the largest quantities. The FDA has already delayed the release of new labels to make it easier to know what is in your food. Well, it is the government, so we may expect its tardiness. The new labels will be easier to read and will reflect portions sizes a person consumes in one sitting.They\u2019re past due by many accounts, and we already know they will be later next year than expected.Let the crockpot be your friend on nights filled with meetings and activities. Set the timer so your meal is ready to eat when you walk in the door hungry.You don\u2019t need another thing to do in the morning, so prepare the meal the night before and store it in the fridge. In the morning place the cold crock in the shell and let it warm up as the shell heats up. Don\u2019t place a cold crock in a hot shell. It\u2019s likely to crack.Need help hacking meal prep?It\u2019s here, courtesy of We Talk Healthy. Eating healthy doesn\u2019t have to be a chore. It\u2019s possible with a little forethought, meal planning, and a few simple steps. Here are other tips.Moving and eating healthier means you are on the right track.

Take the job or pass on it? New city? New house? Just in this short list, we can see that some of the decisions we make are mundane, while others may be a matter of life and death.Since I\u2019ve been focusing on work efficiency in past Wireboard articles, I\u2019d like to look closer at decision-making in organizational\/business contexts. Because regardless of the actual importance or outcome of a decision, how we handle the decision-making process itself can have positive or adverse effects on our efficiency, our time, and even our stress levels, all of which affects our work.The key feature of how we tend to approach decision-making is through a set of unconscious (usually) biases. And why is this? Have you ever noticed how draining some decisions can be to make? Or how sometimes we make snap decisions that we regret later? Last weekend my wife and I were invited to a holiday party by some close friends. I knew it was going to be a big party and so, over the next two days, I spent no less than 15 minutes trying to decide what I was going to wear. Was it going to be a suit, jacket and tie, perhaps a laugh-inducing holiday sweater?Now, while some of our fashion-conscious readers might be wondering what I ended up going with (I\u2019ll tell you at the end of the article), the point is that I was overthinking the decision. In the end, it was a poor use of my time and not a good decision. And while this is a light-hearted example, protracted decision-making costs us time and energy that we could be using for other things. We even have a term for this: decision paralysis. And as I wrote about recently, decision-making is one area where procrastination can crop up. And the bigger the decision, the more-likely it is to invite procrastination. So, let\u2019s take a closer look at what we\u2019re all doing in the midst of decision-making (cognitive biases), and what we can do about it.At Rewire, we spend a lot of time looking at the lizard brain and how it impacts people\u2019s work. And, unsurprisingly, the lizard brain can have a massive impact on our decision-making processes. I call this \u201cThe lizard brain bias for decision-making.\u201d For example:The lizard brain works very quickly in order to reduce the amount of time and energy it takes to make a decision. Notice that I said nothing about whether that decision would be the correct one, only that it would be efficient. And there are a whole host of other biases we often to use when making decisions. There have been a lot of academic studies around these biases and I found over 100 in my research, but I picked three biases that I believe are the most powerful and common in the midst of decision-making:All these biases put us in a tough spot: they help us make decisions faster and easier, but not necessarily better. And if we try to discard the biases, decision-making becomes more laborious and time-consuming. So, what are we to do? How can we make good decisions without decision-paralysis setting in?Pay attention to your internal environment: We\u2019ve written in the past about the power of mindfulness, and that dynamic certainly applies to decision-making. If you\u2019re struggling with a decision, take a moment to breathe and notice your own sensations. Another helpful tool for decision-making here is \u201cHALT.\u201d If you are Hungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired, then don\u2019t make critical decisions. If you can, make decisions when you are at your best during the day (e.g, not at 12:30AM).Relational Impact: Consider who is impacted by your decision (or lack of decision). Sometimes, looking at how others will be impacted by a given decision will help to clarify the decision for you. This is also another way to practice mindfulness, by the way.Rational Analysis: Recall that many of the biases I listed work very quickly and rely on intuition. While intuition has a place, in order to make better decisions, see if there are any actual observations you can make, or data for this decision. You don\u2019t have to write a thesis or anything, just give your rational mind some data to work with and you\u2019ll be amazed how that can quickly reframe and sharpen the decision-making for you. From there, if you still can\u2019t make a decision, you can drill deeper for more data or look for any other systemic information about your decision.Outsider Perspective: Sometimes, decisions are difficult to make because we don\u2019t have enough data and\/or experience. Sometimes, decisions are difficult because we have conflicting values and priorities for the outcomes of a decision. This is precisely where it\u2019s valuable to ask a credible source for input. They might have the data or experience you lack. And because no two people are exactly alike, they may see the value and priority conflicts in a different light. Even (and sometimes especially) if this outside perspective challenges what you think you see, it\u2019s still clarifying and helpful for decision-making.Reflect on the past: Look back on your decision-making history, and ask if you\u2019ve ever been in a situation like this before. How was that situation similar to the current one? How was it different? What were the outcomes? How did you make that decision in the past and what influenced your choice? Think about whether you\u2019ve rushed to judgment in the past. Once we have a better handle on our past, it can help give us perspective for our present decision-making processes.Although these practices might take some time to practice and master initially, they will ultimately save you time and energy.I\u2019ll close by saying again that decisions are coming at us constantly as long as we\u2019re alive. And so we\u2019ll have many, many new opportunities to develop our ability to recognize and manage emotions and biases in our decision-making. And many more opportunities to make decisions that push us towards authentic growth.And, as promised for those of you who\u2019ve read this far, I\u2019ll tell you how the \u201choliday party clothing conundrum\u201d resolved. I ended up wearing a Brooks Brothers suit and tie. Everyone else was dressed casual. A few friends asked if I had just come from a job interview or a funeral. Decision-making matters, people.Written byWritten by","3845":"With the holiday season approaching and shopping fever rushing in, I was having thoughts about the glorious Black Friday and how it is actually affecting our mindset in a somewhat\u2026 Black way.1. Black Friday comes from a place of lack and desperation. Tradespeople are compensating for the whole year of not that awesome sales (being \u201cin the red\u201d) by hitting the high numbers on this very day (and going \u201cback to black\u201d). Statistics show the highest sales for the whole year on this particular day!Read what Wikipedia says about the origin of the term2. Although it is nice consumers can get awesome products and services at a fraction of the price, their behaviour is closer to hunting. Even more \u2014 they act like vultures on carcass in a rather repulsive manner.3. The very adjective Black brings association with darkness, death, depression, and all that jazz! The first time I heard the expression \u201cBlack Friday\u201d, I took it for a reference to the Crucifixion of Christ (why on earth would it be called \u201cGood Friday\u201d??).It is a concept developed by myself and my creative partner Angelina Yaneva.Celebrate abundance, giving, gratitude and new beginnings on this beautiful day!Thank you for supporting #WhiteMonday! Immerse in the beauty of abundance, giving, gratitude and new beginnings \u2764Clap for it so more people could see it! And remember to tell your friends on social media!Written byWritten by","3854":"It\u2019s Wednesday night and we are all seated around a rectangular table. Eye contact is non-existent. Some of the women look haggard, with circles under their eyes and barely-brushed hair. Others look like they just stepped out of an office: polished and with makeup \u201con point,\u201d their high heels click tentatively into the room. They are tall and short, thin and thick, and they have this in common: they want to feel better, and don\u2019t know how.There\u2019s some light conversation as names are briefly exchanged, and we open our books and dive into the topic for the night.As we work our way through the material, it happens. \u201cIt\u2019s probably just me,\u201d Susan says, before continuing her thought.\u201cIt\u2019s probably just me\u201d properly translates to a much more powerful phrase: \u201cI\u2019m the only one, and I\u2019m all alone.\u201dThis is the evil that hides in mental illness, whether it\u2019s depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder \u2014 name your flavor, and I promise isolation and loneliness thrive within (well, perhaps with the one exception of narcissism).It is debilitating and self-stigmatizing. It stops us from reaching out to others for help. When I\u2019m the only one who has these thoughts, no one wants to be my friend. When I struggle to be cheery, no one wants to be around me or they will struggle, too (and it\u2019s my fault). When I am able to put a good face on my illness, no one knows how I\u2019m really feeling \u2014 and I don\u2019t dare tell the truth or they\u2019ll leave me. Even in a crowd of friends, I am an island.\u201cIt\u2019s probably just me\u201d properly translates to a much more powerful phrase: \u201cI\u2019m the only one, and I\u2019m all alone.\u201dNo matter how I turn, I am left alone and lonely. Weird. Cast out. Ostracized, even if it\u2019s just in my own mind.The irony of \u201cit\u2019s probably just me\u201d is that it never is. In fact, I finally made a rule in my support groups: We\u2019ve banned this phrase and its close cousin, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d shows up when someone shares something honest that they think will make someone else sad or that shows how much hurt they are truly in.)One in four people experiences a depression at some point in their life. Three in 100 people live with some form of bipolar disorder. One in six lives with anxiety. When we look at the real numbers, we know: It\u2019s not just me.Here are a few practical tips that help us break out of the isolation we feel. Some of these are harder than others, so be sensitive to where you are on your recovery journey.1) Take baby steps.Loretta wanted to make a doctor appointment, but just felt overwhelmed by it. Instead, she broke it down into baby steps.In the first step, she texted a friend for a recommendation.On the next, she saved that name and phone number on her phone.In the last step, she simply had to click the name to start the call.Breaking down any task into small parts (even tiny parts!) will make it more manageable and help you actually get it done.2) Find a support group.There are churches that offer \u201cLiving Grace\u201d studies (a group I run locally) and others that have \u201cCelebrate Recovery\u201d programs that also address mental health concerns. Most of these programs are not simple \u201cjust turn your worries over to God\u201d approaches; they offer real, practical, evidence-based tips that will help you heal.If you are uncomfortable with the idea of a church-sponsored group, call a local therapist or psychiatrist and find one through them.The best part of a support group is that it proves the lie to \u201cit\u2019s probably just me.\u201d When you are in a support group, you have 100% certainty that someone else in that group knows how you feel and has felt that way before (or feels that way now).Here\u2019s what I want you to know: It\u2019s not just you. You are not alone. If no one else, I am in this fight with you. I am on your side.3) Accept every offer of help you get.People don\u2019t offer help they don\u2019t want to give (and if they do, that\u2019s their own issue to deal with). Accepting and receiving help is as much a part of a relationship as giving and sharing are.4) Join a small group of some sort.This might be taking an art or photography class at a local community college. Or it could be a Bible study through your church, a knitting group that meets at a local yarn store, or some other activity. Whatever it is, get yourself into a position to be exposed to people who have a similar interest to yours \u2014 and where your illness doesn\u2019t have to be center stage to the relationship.5) Join a Facebook group specific to your illness. (Yes! Technology helps here!)I belong to three Facebook groups specific to bipolar disorder. I like them because they remind me that the symptoms I have are not unique to me, and it helps me remember that I have a \u201creal\u201d illness and am not \u201ccrazy.\u201d6) Know who to call, and for what.My stay-at-home-mom friends are people I can call on if I need an emergency pickup for my kid, or who can help me get to the doctor.My next door neighbor is amazing for when I just need a break at the end of a tough day.My church friends are wonderful if I need meal-train help, or need a reminder that God loves me even when I can\u2019t experience him.My girlfriends from high-school are great for when I need a giggle.My support-group friends remind me that I\u2019m not alone in the fight. I can cry and rant and share my honest thoughts, and know I\u2019m not alone. They give me hugs.My husband walks with me through it all. Sometimes he takes over laundry, housework, and paying the bills, even though those are \u201cmy\u201d jobs in our division of household labor.Participating in our community and accepting help from those around us is not easy, especially when \u201cit\u2019s probably just me\u201d dominates our thoughts. The fears we have of bringing others down or being ostracized for being honest about how we truly feel are self-stigmatizing and cause us to pull back and isolate when we need our friends the most.One in four people experiences a depression at some point in their life. Three in 100 people live with some form of bipolar disorder. One in six lives with anxiety. When we look at the real numbers, we know: It\u2019s not just me.The more we break out of our isolation, the better we will feel. The more we learn to lean on our friends and support network as we traverse our journey to remission, the easier it is to stay in remission once the storm passes.Here\u2019s what I want you to know: It\u2019s not just you. You are not alone. If no one else, I am in this fight with you. I am on your side.Lord, I ask you to watch over those who feel alone, those who are afraid to ask for or receive help. Feeling alone, God, is terrifying. While I know you are with us all the time, you designed us to crave human connection as well.

You\u2019re experiencing an excruciating amount of pain in your lower abdomen. After days of the pain building, you finally go to the hospital. They quickly schedule a time for surgery. You have your appendix removed. All is well.Scenario B: You have depression. Your appetite has gotten out of control. You have been gaining weight rapidly. Your energy levels are at an all time low. You have persistent negative thoughts that are destroying your marriage. In response, you go see a therapist. Depression is officially diagnosed.In Scenario A, the diagnosis is followed shortly by the situation being resolved.In Scenario B, the road to recovery has barely begun after the diagnosis. Depression could take weeks, months, or years to treat. There\u2019s no surgery\/drug that will immediately alleviate the pain. The diagnosis itself often presents more problems without solving much at all. Here\u2019s why I believe they\u2019re ineffective.Symptom Diversity Limits the Power of the Diagnostic LabelOne of my favorite professors in college once said, \u201cIf you know a person with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), then that\u2019s all you know, just ONE person with ASD.\u201d The autistic spectrum allows for a tremendous amount of diversity. Following in suit, if you look into other psychological disorders, you\u2019ll find that no two people with a diagnosis are the same. Homogeneity with mental health is almost nonexistent which disarms the helpfulness of a diagnosis.Some people will exhibit 5 symptoms of the disorder. Some may exhibit just 3 with a higher severity. Labels don\u2019t describe these differences.Tell a doctor that you have insomnia. They have a clear objective: helping you get to sleep.Tell a doctor you have depression, and without getting more information, they can only guess at ways to best help. The main objective may be dealing with mood control, diet problems, suicidal ideation, lack of exercise, or family issues etc. The diagnostic label does not accommodate for these nuances.Etiology>DiagnosisEtiology is the scientific term for a disease\u2019s causes. In the world of psychology, etiology is supremely important. There are a thousand different reasons why a person might be depressed. Depending on the etiology, treatment could be as simple as adding a vitamin D supplement or as complex as taking an antidepressant and going to therapy. When etiology frames a disorder, we get much closer to identifying a clear way to help.Asking yourself, \u201cDo I have this disorder?\u201d is a practically USELESS. Worst case scenario: you convince yourself that you have a disorder without any input from a psychologist. You may even get bogged down with the label.Asking yourself, \u201cWhat CAUSES my problems?\u201d is a much better question. Even if you do not have a disorder, this question never ceases to be useful. In labelling causes, not yourself, you can feel empowered to start managing whatever symptoms you may have. If you cannot handle the symptoms on your own, then find a doctor that can help. In my opinion the diagnostic label just complicates the process. The root causes of your problems need to be dealt with regardless of a diagnosis.Self-Diagnosis is a Real ProblemI rarely get \u201ctriggered\u201d, but this definitely drives me up the wall. I have found that labels aren\u2019t all that helpful for mental health problems so when I hear someone tell me that they have borderline personality disorder, anxiety, depression, multiple personality disorder, and ADD, I have to resist rolling my eyes. Psychological disorders do have overlap; there is no denying that. However, I know for a fact that a psychologist did not give you all those diagnoses.In psychology, the goal is to find the most disruptive symptom(s) and assign a label based on those symptoms. Why? To account for overlap (comorbidity). Your depression could be causing you to have a short attention span. Your borderline personality disorder could be feeding into your anxiety.Treating the most significant symptom(s) will alleviate many of the minor symptoms. There is no need for 5 diagnoses when treating the main problem reduces the impact of the lesser symptoms.When you self-diagnose, you run the risk of catastrophizing your situation. Soon you begin to think that you have more problems than you actually have. Reading a list of symptoms and finding 4\u20135 that have been relevant to you at some point is EASY. Understand that these diagnoses are for clinically significant symptoms, which have a huge negative impact on work, school, relationships, and daily tasks.It is perfectly OK to feel negative emotions. Odds are your symptoms do not warrant a diagnosis.Self-diagnosis also devalues the narratives of people with severe symptoms. Claiming you have ADD, when you do not have it, may spread misconceptions.DO NOT use an undiagnosed condition as an excuse. Doing that does real damage. There are people that legitimately need to use their diagnosis to reach out for help.Labels Do Not Account for Time\/Severity\/Current ConditionCancer is labelled in stages that help doctors describe the patient\u2019s status and make decisions for how to proceed. Mental health problems have no such descriptors. If you were diagnosed with social anxiety, there would not be a label to indicate severity, etiology, or timing.Even adding little pieces of information would help a great deal. Humor me, but I believe that if a person could say that their anxiety is on level 2T; with the 2 indicating the severity on a scale of 1\u20135, and the T indicating that they are in treatment currently, then that would drastically help people communicate their needs.Your depression is type S1? Thanks for letting me know. I now know that it\u2019s seasonal (because of the S), and I can be happy for you because the severity is only at level 1. It\u2019s likely that you have progressed in treatment.There are a variety of ways to create a system like this. Imagine being able to google \u201cADD type 3A\u201d and read about exactly what your friend is dealing with because the label is precise. That would be phenomenal.Labels Contribute to StereotypesExamples of successful people with mental health disorders in the media is sorely lacking, so misconceptions are going to flourish. You hear about mental health problems in the context of abuse, suicide, and crime. Pro tip for those in Hollywood: movies\/shows that handle mental health issues with courage are wildly successful. I can already tell that I will write about this topic later.Anyhow, when someone thinks of mental health disorders, they may instinctively think of dangerous individuals. Undoubtedly, mental illness can lead to destructive action, yet I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that perfectly sane people can do terrible things. Also, mental illness has enabled people to do amazing things. There\u2019s a give and take.The Bottom Line: Individualized CareMy main concern is that people are being misled by what a diagnoses actually accomplishes. A diagnosis is for doctors to communicate with each other about treatment options. It is not something that should be the target of perpetual speculation.You don\u2019t need to take a ten question quiz to find out what you need to change to be healthier. Avoid the temptation to self-diagnose and instead take action based on your individual situation.If you believe you have a condition, there is nothing stopping you from taking practical steps towards treating it. You don\u2019t need a label\u2019s permission to change your life for the better. There is the possibility that with enough preventative care you can manage your symptoms without the need for diagnosis.Over-diagnosis has been a serious problem in the past decades while under-diagnosis is also a problem. How is this possible? People are being diagnosed that do not have a disorder, and people that are in need of help do not receive a diagnosis.To solve this issue, using labels properly would be a good way to improve going forward. Additionally, I think a more realistic portrayal of the mentally ill would be of great help. As expressed earlier, I also like the idea of revamping diagnoses so that they can better describe an individual\u2019s state of mind.People don\u2019t need labels. No matter what may be wrong\u2026 they need anything and everything that facilitates individualized care.Written byWritten by","3925":"\u201cSo long as you can sweeten another\u2019s pain, life is not in vain.\u201d~Helen KellerHis statement made me angry.When I left his office I felt more lost than before I went in. I was thankful to get into my car. Alone. My anger turned into overwhelming sadness. The sobs started and kept coming like gigantic waves one after the other.Who wants to get used to living with chronic nerve pain?In my early twenties, I sincerely believed that I would be exempt from pain and suffering if I lived the way God wanted me to. Filled with pride, I was happy to share my perspective with anyone who would listen. I must have sounded ridiculous!Thirty years later, nothing could have prepared me for the level of pain I would endure after being diagnosed with a rare neurological disease.January 2018 will mark four years since my health changed. Life as I have always known it is in my rear view mirror. I have embraced the words of one of my favorite authors, Corrie ten Boom, \u201cNever be afraid to trust an unknown future to a known God.\u201dIt is true that my future with Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy is unknown. RSD is not life threatening, just life altering.Pain is my constant companion. Sometimes it seems random and meaningless.God ordained that Jesus, His only Son, would suffer. \u201cSince he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all\u2026\u201d (Romans 8:32)Jesus is the only innocent sufferer, and yet his suffering was so radically voluntary.If God wouldn\u2019t spare Jesus why would He spare me?Here are ten truths that have helped me make positive steps towards managing forever pain.\u201cCan anything ever separate us from Christ\u2019s love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity\u2026\u201d (Romans 8:35)\u201cAnd I am convinced nothing can ever separate us from God\u2019s love.\u201d (Romans 8:38)\u201c\u2026nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God.\u201d (Romans 8:39)2. Life is different, but not over.3. I have learned that there is more to life than being pain free.4. God has a plan for my life even if I can\u2019t see it now.\u201cI know the plans I have for you,\u201d says the Lord. (Jeremiah 29:11)5. My circumstances are out of my control.\u201cThe Lord has established His throne in the heavens, And His sovereignty (control) rules over all.\u201d (Psalm 103:19)6. I have physical limitations and I have to be okay with that.7. Sleep is my number one priority.8. Feelings are real, but not always realistic or reliable. They can escalate and drive me over the edge emotionally if I\u2019m not careful.9. Suffering is lonely and isolating. Beware!10. God loves me for who I am and not for who I think I should be.One of our pastors at church spoke on identifying our personal platform for sharing the Gospel. Today, my platform is pain.-Make me more relatable to others who suffer.-Make me kinder, more compassionate, and more understanding.-Focus on what\u2019s most important, God and relationships.-Strengthen my prayer life.-Make me more dependent on Him.-Change my heart attitude.-Slow down my lifestyle, increasing margin and setting boundaries.The grind and monotony of days, weeks, and months of unrelenting pain has been a beat down. But years of saturating my soul with God\u2019s Word, has protected me from losing my spiritual footing in the midst of some serious physical affliction.\u201cSometimes God delivers us from suffering, and other times he sustains us through suffering. Sometimes God calms the storm, and sometimes he calms the heart. Both are acts of grace, and both should prompt us to praise Him.\u201d ~Randy AlcornThis quote by Randy Alcorn is my experience. God has sustained me day after day. More often than not, He has calmed my heart while the storm was raging around me.I love Psalm 107:23\u201331.\u201cTheir ships were tossed to the heavens and plunged again to the depths; the sailors cringed in terror. They reeled and staggered like drunkards, and were at their wits end.Lord, help! They cried in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.He calmed the storm to a whisper and stilled the waves.What a blessing was that stillness as he brought them safely into harbor!\u201d (Psalm 103:26\u201330)Four years.Many days filled with tears.But God has quieted all my fears.Chapter after chapter of life reads the same,I try desperately not to complain.Because my life is not in vain,If I can Glorify God in my forever pain.~Ally HollandWritten byWritten by","4065":"by Nancy Booth, recovering hurrier, listener extraordinaire, lover of God and of children, looking for a restful ChristmasYou have a to do list that is never ending. The Christmas season is packed with a million wonderful things and yet it\u2019s lost its luster for you. You begin to dread getting up in the morning. What is going on in your mind, heart and body? Christmas is coming and you want to feel all joyous, happy and hopeful. Instead you feel all worried, grumpy and exhausted. How can you find any time to plug into a Christmas rest that restores?When I think about Christmas rest, I think about letting go of all the hustle and bustle and letting God direct my steps, which is easier said than done. I am so good at making lists, scurrying around to get things done and making sure that everyone is happy and glad. However, I am slowing learning that \u201cmaking\u201d everyone happy and glad for the holiday season is not necessarily my job. In the past, when I have attempted to do that, I am usually the one who gets mad and grumpy.To practice Christmas rest, plugging into sacred moments through simplicity, silence and solitude are ways I have found helpful. These practices provide the time needed to restore my mind, heart and body so that I can feel joyous, happy and hopeful, no matter my circumstances. How do I give myself permission to regularly plug into simplicity, silence and solitude?Inherent in the word simplicity is simple. The act of simplicity helps me determine what is essential in my life. How do you enjoy the holiday season and make it simple for yourself and your family? How much of the \u201ctraditions\u201d can you eliminate and still make it meaningful?For example, this year, our family decided that regifting or shopping at a thrift store were viable options for gifting as well as giving each other short gift lists of practical items. This simple choice has taken a huge pressure off our budget as well as lessening time in the stores. It also means we\u2019ll have more time for games and memory-making when we get together as a family because there won\u2019t be so many gifts to open.Christmas time can be noisy, with lots of activities, people, places via for your attention. Taking time to sit with God in silence can totally refresh your mind, body and soul. Silence is a chance for your brain to regenerate, reduce stress and tension and be reflective.It also gives you a chance to listen to God and ask Him what your priorities for the day might be so you don\u2019t have so much to decide every day. Even 10 minutes can be very restorative. I have found that silence, while challenging, is refreshing my mind, body and soul.Even in a busy household, you can enjoy solitude. It might be in the shower, if necessary. However brief, that time of solitude \u2014 a time for yourself to recharge without any demands on you is a time of rest.By filling your own mind, body and soul with quiet and care for yourself, you are then able to give out of a full cup. Rest in solitude restores. This solitude time is as important as work times. Giving yourself permission to just be held by God will bless your mind, body and soul.How will you create your sacred Christmas rest? What can you make more simple in your life and your family\u2019s life? What would silence with God look like? Where can you go for some solitude?As you read these questions, what resistance is bubbling up? Acknowledge the resistance and take that to God as well so that you can find the restorative Christmas rest you desire this season.In this world of darkness and angst, I am grateful for Christmas rest and sacred moments with God. He lights our paths and restores hope and joy in our families, regardless of our circumstances.It\u2019s not easy but it is possible and the rewards are great. Get my list of 10 Ways to Find Sacred Moments This Christmas for additional ways to find sacred, restorative moments as you seek the Christmas rest. These sacred moments can provide the hope and balance you want for you and your family.

I\u2019m just a girl, standing in front of a mirror, asking her body what the hell is wrong and how I can fix it.*Last year, I was finally diagnosed with hypermobility syndrome after many years of chronic neck and shoulder pain. Earlier this year, I was told I also have EDS, or Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which is a group of connective tissue disorders resulting from faulty collagen production.Suddenly, everything I had been suffering from throughout my life made sense \u2014 the aching leg pains at night when I was a kid, the insane flexibility, the easy bruising, the migraines\u2026it all clicked. In some ways, I was relieved. In many other ways, I was devastated.Staying in shape was always a part of my life. In junior high and high school, I played volleyball. In college, I had a personal trainer. After college, I was on the yoga mat at least four times a week. This committed spiritual and physical regimen, unfortunately, turned out to be what triggered my EDS diagnosis and chronic pain.The continuous overstretching, which I didn\u2019t realize was happening due to my hypermobility, wore my already flimsy ligaments and tendons down. Soon, I was unraveling (literally) and in constant pain. I had to come to terms with the fact that the one thing I loved was seriously hurting me. I stopped doing yoga and eventually began my quest to find a diagnosis. Three years later, I got it.Now, at 28 years old and with months and months of physical therapy and medication and injections under my belt with nothing to show for it, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I need to find a way to be physical and active again.I know I\u2019ll never be able to exercise the way I used to \u2014 I can\u2019t lift weights, I can\u2019t do Vinyasa yoga, I can\u2019t participate in a Tough Mudder or play volleyball\u2026but after much research, I stumbled upon a video that truly outlines a healthy way for people like me to get in shape safely.I\u2019ve used this video to create my own regimen and set of best practices, and I wanted to share it with my fellow Zebras. But first\u2026For any of us to truly treat our bodies right, we have to understand what\u2019s happening with them.In healthy folks, tendons and ligaments act like metal coils (taut and stable) and muscles act like rubber bands (able to stretch but not too far because of those tight coils connecting them).In folks like me with EDS\/hypermobility, it\u2019s the opposite. My tendons and ligaments act like rubber bands (stretchy) and are unable to hold the muscles and bones together. My muscles, as a result, are constantly in contraction mode for protection, therefore they are always tight and activated because of all the work they have to do for my useless ligaments. This is why no matter how hard I try, no matter how many massages I get, my muscles just will not calm down.And if I attempt to stretch out my muscles like a normal person, what I\u2019m actually stretching are the tendons and ligaments. NOT GOOD.And because my muscles and bones aren\u2019t held together properly, it\u2019s easy for my joints to be out of whack and to have subluxations and dislocations. For example, my right shoulder blade slowly slips out of place approximately 10,000 times a day. I then have to adjust it and pop it to get it back in.All of this puts constant stress on my joints and causes chronic pain.But if you look at my joints via x-ray or MRI, nothing looks off. At most, some of my joints look like there is a lot of space in between them. For example, my right AC joint has 8mm of space. A normal person has 4mm. But there is no tear, no inflammation, no visible osteoarthritis. All that exists, and you can\u2019t see it, are overly stretched ligaments.Ligaments cannot be strengthened or tightened through exercise. This is why scientists and doctors are experimenting with prolotherapy, which involves injecting a substance (sometimes sugar, sometimes a combination of things) into the ligaments in order to strengthen them. But this is experimental, therefore pricey and out of pocket.So what we are left with is physical therapy. Kathryn Lister, associate clinic director with Physiotherapy Associates, hosted a webinar sponsored by the Ehlers-Danlos Society in 2015 called Intelligent Exercise. In this incredibly informative video, she outlines how hypermobile bodies work, why they work that way, and how we can work with them with proper, targeted physical therapy and exercise.According to Lister, the most important thing for us to do is to focus on our stabilizing muscles. The vital ones include the rotator cuff, multifidi, and deep hip stabilizers. These should be our primary focus because they are the first-line defense when it comes to stabilizing a joint, which our EDS and hypermobile bodies have to do constantly.These muscles aren\u2019t seen by the naked eye on the outside, therefore it\u2019s easy to ignore them. But they are vital. These muscles are on and activated all the time. Because of this constant work, they can only fire at about 20\u201325 percent of their effort.After we stabilize and strengthen those deep, core muscles, we can then work on strengthening\/stabilizing the pects, biceps, and lats; erectors and quadratus; and our gluts and hip flexors. These are the muscles bodybuilders focus on during their workouts because these are the muscles we can actually see. These are the muscles that also help us move.But in order to move properly, we need something stable underneath those muscles. This is why we must focus on our stabilizers mentioned above first.And what happens if we ignore those stabilizers, like most people do, AND we have faulty ligaments and tendons that can\u2019t make up the difference? It forces our other muscles, our movers, to do all the work.Lister put it this way:Telling our movers to do the job of stabilizing would be like telling a sprinter that they need to run 26 miles.By overusing our movers, as we EDS patients do, we are continuously putting ourselves at risk for injury, chronic pain, and inflammation. So how do we turn on our stabilizers and strengthen them properly so our movers don\u2019t get overwhelmed?The key is subtlety, according to Lister. When you\u2019re attempting stabilizing exercises like chin tucks and neck bends and doorway stretches, you can\u2019t push too hard or else you will force your stabilizers to go beyond that 20\u201325 percent of their effort, making your movers come in and pick up the slack. If you\u2019re seeing your ligaments or muscles pop out and trying to flaunt themselves during your stretches and exercises, pull back. You\u2019re going too hard.Another key component to remember is isometrics. We want to focus on exercises that isolate\/target the individual muscles and activate them without actually moving the joint. This is the safest way to work the muscles we need to strengthen \u2014 finding a neutral position and gently activating them. If you\u2019re sweating, you\u2019re doing it wrong.You can find examples of isometric training here, here and here.Lastly, and this wasn\u2019t in Lister\u2019s video but is something I\u2019ve researched on my own, we need to focus on concentric movements. In a nutshell, a concentric contraction shortens your muscle as it acts against resistive force (like a weight). For example, during a biceps curl, the biceps contract concentrically during the lifting phase of the exercise.THIS is the part of that movement we want to emphasize. And when we bring our arm back down during the curl, we CANNOT extend our arm all the way down to the bottom.We want to perform as many of these concentric exercises as possible. We want to shorten our muscles, not extend them.You can find examples of these exercises here, here and here.Neck stability is particularly important for EDS patients, many of whom suffer from POTS and dysautonomia.Your neck houses your spinal cord, so the more instability you have in your neck, the angrier your spinal cord will get and the more symptoms related to dysautonomia and POTS you will get, ranging from dizziness to headaches to blurred vision and fainting spells.Shoulder stability is also vital for EDS patients because of how mobile and therefore vulnerable the rotator cuff is. Performing gentle exercises that activate the cuff is important because as Lister said, \u201cThe stronger that these stabilizing muscles become, the better we are at knowing where our shoulder is in space.\u201dWe can also perform exercises to stabilize and strengthen the core and hips, including wall pushups and bridges.Of course, while you figure out how these exercises work for you, you will likely still have your ongoing pain.Most EDS patients suffer from chronic pain, which is defined as pain that lasts longer than three months. Chronic pain can often trigger what is known as neurogenic pain. This means our bodies have become so sensitive that things that never used to cause us pain now do. Basically, our pain tolerance has dropped significantly because our neurological system is always active and ready to brace for impact.Lister suggests helping offset this hyperactive system via rescue exercises \u2014 basically, these are movements and positions one would try out on babies that won\u2019t stop crying. Try lying on your back, feet on the floor, knees facing up, and rolling from side to side slowly, dropping your knees as you go.Small, slow movements, ones similar to yin and restorative yoga postures, are the best bet. Do these every night before you go to bed, or any time during the day, and it should help calm your system.The sad part about all of this? It took me more than three years to find something that might work and it took me doing my own research after three rounds of physical therapy from three different therapists to stumble upon a video that explained the proper way for me to move. Not a single one of my therapists knew how to treat EDS and, as it turns out, all of them were having me do exercises incorrectly.To sum up what I\u2019ve found about exercising with EDS and\/or hypermobility:Learn about how your individual body works and responds to movements and to life. We are all unique, and our workouts and regimens will vary depending on that uniqueness.Look at someone doing Crossfit and strongman competitions and think you can do it too. We just really, really can\u2019t. In the short-term? Maybe. In the long-run? We\u2019ll fall apart.Focus on strengthening your rotator cuff, multifidi, and deep hip stabilizers via subtle, isolated, contracted movements.Try to bulk up your biceps and your quads and your abs without having those stable muscles underneath primed and ready to go.Practice restorative, relaxing postures like happy baby. It will help calm your nerves and likely reduce your overall pain response.Do any high impact exercises like running (especially on concrete) or contact sports. Our joints cannot handle it. If you want to engage in something more intense, try swimming!Use foam rollers to massage out knots.Do static stretching like everyone else. We end up stretching our ligaments instead, and that is the exact opposite of what we want.And most importantly\u2026Go easy on yourself. EDS is tough. So is hypermobility. We don\u2019t need to add guilt on top of the many challenges we already face as a result of our disorder.If you can, call around to physical therapists in your area and see if any of them specialize in hypermobility. If you find one, be as vocal and open as you can about your concerns. WE are the ones who should be in control of our recovery and our EDS.Lister\u2019s video on Intelligent Exercise with all of the above information and more can be viewed here:Written byWritten by","4366":"What is jojoba?Jojoba is a plant that comes from Arizona and Mexico where it is grown for its wax (commonly called \u201cjojoba oil\u201d) contained in its seeds.

Jojoba oil is extracted from it in the form of liquid wax.Jojoba in cosmetics: an essential ingredientFor the skin, jojoba helps to regulate the secretion of sebum. It is therefore ideal for sensitive or dry skin but also acne problems. It is well-known for its moisturizing and softening virtues. Indeed, jojoba oil creates a non-greasy film that preserves the natural moisture of the skin against external aggressions such as cold or dryness.Jojoba can also be used on hair. It nourishes them, softens, strengthens and accentuates their shine. Jojoba oil treats effectively seborrheic hypersecretion and dandruff.In addition, jojoba oil is used as an antioxidant to protect cosmetic formulations.How to know if a cosmetic product contains jojoba?To find out if a cosmetic product contains jojoba (wax or oil), just look at the list of its ingredients. The scientific name for jojoba is Simmondsia chinensis. Simmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) seed cera \/ wax will indicate jojoba wax, while simmondsia chinensis oil (jojoba seed oil) will indicate jojoba oil.Where to find products containing jojoba?It is found in many:- organic certified mascaras,- organic certified reds and lip pencils- bio-certified foundations and bb cream- certified organic face exfoliating creamWritten byWritten by","4473":"The one thing I know for certain in life is that I have to keep trying. No matter how long I have been practicing a good habit, it can always be uprooted at any moment. That\u2019s why I find it so important to have a versatile tool kit to repair my habits and practices when they get broken.I have had a fairly consistent meditation practice for about seven years now. Over those years, my practice has evolved and grown in many different ways. It began with me sitting on the floor, closing my eyes, and setting a timer to see how long I could sit still for. Three minutes, turned into five, five turned to 10 and eventually I was sitting for 20 to 30 minutes at a time.With consistent practice, I notice the anxiety of never having enough time in the day diminishes. I notice I am more patient and tolerant of daily annoyances like traffic and waiting in lines. I also notice that my will power is stronger, my creativity increases, and my overall happiness is greater.Yet despite, all these wonderful benefits, I still have to work at getting my practice in. I still have days that I don\u2019t feel like sitting. I still have mornings that I have to rush out the door without meditating. When those days begin to pile up and the practice begins to become not so regular, I notice the effects.Bad habits sneak in.Cravings are harder to manage.My chest tightens and my neck and shoulders get stiff.My patience dwindles and I get snippier with family and friends.Anxiety bubbles up under the surface.This is when I have to buckle down and bring meditation back to the top of my priority list. Over the years, I have found different ways to help keep my practice consistent and fresh so that if and when I fall off the wagon, it doesn\u2019t last long and I quickly get back on.Because life is messy and unpredictable, I have to have a versatile tool box for keeping me on track.Depending on what I am struggling with, I have different tools for repairing the problem.Whether it\u2019s time pressures, fears, or cravings, I have found some helpful ways get to the root of the problem so I can come back to a happier more creative state of mind.Here are 4 problems I encounter with their respective counteractive practices:Most people have a commute to work. This is a guaranteed built in time that is set aside each day. Whether you drive your own car, take public transportation, ride your bike, or walk, you can use this dedicated time as a meditative practice. Mindfulness meditation can be practiced with your eyes open and simply concentrating on the task at hand. Focusing on the breath or the body is a good way to begin. If you are driving, you can focus on the feel of your hands on the steering wheel and being aware of your body in the car. Notice whether you are tense or relaxed, whether your breath is shallow or deep. When your mind wanders, bring it back to the feeling of your hands on the steering wheel. You can set a timer for yourself or try a guided meditation.

I have a tendency to snack when I get fidgety and I have found that coloring is a great way to control these cravings. It\u2019s also great when my mind is racing and I know I need to meditate but the thought of sitting still for even a few minutes seems impossible.I break out the coloring book and pencils and the stress melts away. It allows my mind to relax while giving my fingers something to do. It helps suppress that urge to put food in my mouth when I\u2019m not hungry because I\u2019m being active with my hands. Research shows that coloring relaxes the amygdala which is the part of the brain that controls stress. According to the blog, Pocket Mindfulness,Coloring activates the parts of the brain that support creativity. A study conducted in 2005 by Nancy Curry and Tim Kasser found that those who colored in mandalas reported drastically decreased anxiety levels.Psychologist Carl Jung was known for having his patients color mandalas as part of their therapy with him. He believed it was a good way for his patients to experience the benefits of meditation.So if you struggle with a meditation practice, coloring can be a good alternative to relax the mind and achieve a meditative state.I first discovered this amazing toy many years ago when I studied abroad in Prague. They were sold at street vendors and I became obsessed with it. I couldn\u2019t leave my room without it. I would play with it constantly.At the time, I had no idea that it was a symbol used in Buddhism and Hinduism to represent the Universe. I just knew that it was very calming and relaxing to change the shapes. I had forgotten about it for many years, until recently my sister gave me one as a gift. I have rediscovered it\u2019s magical powers.It is traditionally used as a meditation tool. The wire puzzle can be configured into 35 different shapes. It has a calming effect on the nervous system and aids in concentration and creativity. It\u2019s a great tool for fidgety folks who need to keep their hands busy. I like to keep it at my desk and use it while I\u2019m working to keep my mind clear and focused. Plus, it\u2019s just fun to use!I am in week two of a 4 week mindful writing class and it has been incredibly helpful in dealing with doubts and negative thoughts. The combination of these two practices really helps to break through the negative chatter of the brain. According to neuroscience, meditation, including mindful walking, decreases the size of the amygdala. This is the brain\u2019s fight or flight center and is where we experience fearful and anxious emotions.Mindful walking also helps to synchronize the right and left hemispheres of the brain. This sets the mind up for a more open and clear writing experience. When I tried this, I was amazed at what came out on the page. I very clearly uncovered some fears and doubts that were previously blocking my writing.Try it:Finding happiness, creativity, and peace is a life long journey. There is no magic pill or definitive practice that will work every time, under any circumstance. If there were, we\u2019d all be bored with perfection.Rather than looking at your struggles as obstacles, try seeing them as challenges that you can rise to meet. Each challenge might require a different approach, but as you fill up your toolbox you\u2019ll be better equipped to handle each situation.Follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and InstagramSign up for my free newsletter and I\u2019ll send you my latest discoveries in mindfulness, happiness, and creating a balanced life.Written byWritten by","4498":"1 \u2013 Pick up your To-Do list and put a \u2018complete by\u2019 time\/date on each item.

Do this one regularly if you can!8 \u2013 E-mail, call or talk to that person about that thing that you\u2019ve been putting off.

I am still glowing from that moment a few months ago when, at 59, I crossed the finish, for the first time, at the\u2026","4576":"Apparently, some people still don\u2019t understand what body shaming means. It has nothing to do with health or fitness. Healthy people don\u2019t make life choices out of guilt, fear, or a desire to please others.When celebrities proudly declare on national television that they like being shamed, we have a problem. Nobody should like being shamed. If they do, they need therapy.Nobody should think they\u2019re doing a friend or loved one favors by commenting on their appearance. Shaming involves nothing other than hypocrites judging those who don\u2019t fit an ideal body type.Take one of my college friends. A model. For real, people paid her money to wear their clothes in advertisements. Probably the most attractive person I\u2019ve ever shared oxygen with. She never described being shamed as a pleasant experience, or thanked anyone for it.My model friend once cried to me over coffee about her body. A lingerie company had rejected her. Why? Her butt was one inch too big. Someone had actually wrapped measuring tape around each part of her.Thousands of young women envied my friend\u2019s physique. By all standards, she was gorgeous.\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d I said. \u201cWho can tell the difference between two asses by one inch?\u201dMy comment didn\u2019t help. So I tried again. \u201cI mean, you\u2019ve got a great ass.\u201d And I was telling the absolute truth. It was the kind of ass that stopped men in the street. The kind of ass that solicits catcalls.But this ass wasn\u2019t good enough for a lingerie brand.My point? Even professionals don\u2019t enjoy being shamed. Here was my friend, a practical stick, tearing up over a single inch. And she had no reason to feel bad. If one inch can send a demi-goddess into an emotional spiral, imagine what happens when an ordinary person hears that kind of criticism from friends, family, and spouses.It\u2019s healthy to enlist life partners in your fitness goals. Let\u2019s say a married couple decides to go on a diet. They exercise together and decide on meal plans. They buy matching Fitbits. Maybe they hold each other accountable for their daily goals. \u201cHoney, did you reach your 10,000 steps today?\u201d How cute. Couples do that all the time.Let\u2019s say you hire a personal trainer to keep you on track. Your personal trainer reminds you about your fitness goals and helps you attain them. They don\u2019t roll their eyes if you haven\u2019t lost \u201call the weight\u201d by spring break. A personal trainer doesn\u2019t call you a fat ass or a failure. They want to create a positive atmosphere at their gym.What\u2019s not healthy? Treating your friends and loved ones like personal trainers and nutritionists. Asking them to berate you for skipping workouts. There\u2019s a big difference between someone encouraging healthy choices and giving you the side eye if you order cheesecake.Your husband probably isn\u2019t an expert on fitness or nutrition. Neither is your dad. Or your mom. Or your girlfriend.Why put them in control of that?I\u2019m not exactly a saint. If my partner started eating Big Macs every day and gained 20 pounds, I\u2019d have a problem. I might say something. We\u2019d probably have an earnest conversation. I\u2019m sure he would do the same for me. We exercise together. We talk about nutrition. If one of us finds out that a particular food has a lot of sodium, we let the other know.But I would never give someone else control over my health. I\u2019ll be damned if I ever let anyone call me a fat ass every time I walk into the kitchen. I don\u2019t care if I\u2019m trying to lose weight. That\u2019s abusive behavior. Who would give someone permission to act like that?My parents body shamed me constantly growing up. They put me on diets. Took photographs of me at various weights and posted them on the fridge. At one point, they even stashed a motion-detecting pig that oinked at me whenever I opened the pantry.My dad referred to me as a buffalo in front of company. My mom rolled her eyes every time I took a bite of food. She screamed at me one afternoon because she thought I\u2019d drank an entire gallon of milk. Sure, she apologized after I explained that the milk had gone bad, so I\u2019d poured it down the sink. But the torpedo had hit. And my self esteem was sunk for the rest of the day, if not the month. That\u2019s body shaming.The silly part? I was never overweight. Not even close. My parents just thought I should look thinner. When I turned 12, they bought me fitness equipment. For my 13th birthday, I got an actual cardio machine. They were so smug when they presented it to me.They got more than they bargained for. A few months later, my parents did a complete 180. \u201cYou should eat more,\u201d my dad started saying.My mom would play backup singer. \u201cYou really should,\u201d she\u2019d say. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about you.\u201d This coming from the woman who\u2019d put me on an all vegetable diet four summers ago.Why were my parents so worried? Because I was growing a little taller, and puberty had started. The opposite sex was taking interest in me. They couldn\u2019t convince me I was at risk of looking chubby anymore. So they took the next best strategy. Skinny shaming.When I was fourteen, my mom presented Polaroids of me from three years ago. \u201cYou used to look so healthy,\u201d she said. They were the same photos she\u2019d once used to convince me to lose weight.The truth? My weight has always been stable \u2014 despite whatever doubt happens inside my head. Fortunately, the fat and skinny shaming didn\u2019t send me down the well of anorexia or bulimia, like so many others. Pure luck, in my opinion. Sure, I go through sensitive phases. I still look at myself in the mirror and wonder if I\u2019m thin enough. Like it or not, good or bad, that\u2019s probably never going away. I just manage it.In high school I ran track and cross-country \u2014 against my parents\u2019 advice. They thought it would kill me. In college, I gravitated to backpacking, hiking, and kayaking. By then, they finally stopped caring.It\u2019s a shame that I\u2019ve lived an active lifestyle, eaten healthy, and never had to go on a \u201cdiet,\u201d and yet men and women like me still worry about one day suddenly becoming \u201cfat,\u201d or unappealing. That\u2019s just insane.Everyone has their own fitness and weight goals. You can always change those. And it\u2019s always nice to share those goals with friends and family. But it\u2019s nonsense to let someone shame you into a healthy lifestyle.In fact, that\u2019s a heavy sack of bullshit. Nobody responds to shame. If anything, feelings of guilt and inadequacy trigger unhealthy choices. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s your father, husband, wife, or sister. Don\u2019t ever let anyone talk to you like you\u2019re lazy, fat, or stupid. Fuck those people. And fuck anyone who tells you it\u2019s okay. Or that it works. It doesn\u2019t.Written byWritten by","4587":"As Dig Inn\u2019s Supply and Menu Development Manager, Kristen Barnett\u2019s job includes: testing variations of a kale salad with goat cheese crumbles, deciding the perfect circumference of a Happy Valley meatball, and comparing bias vs. square cuts of wild Alaskan salmon (her verdict: Bias looks wayyy fancier and keeps the salmon from drying out).Despite her daily duties, the 25-year-old has been vegan for three years. It\u2019s a lifestyle change she undertook for her health \u2014 and has since become a pillar of her holistic approach to living well. For Barnett, eating a plant-based diet is necessary to treat her chronic Lyme disease.Whether you\u2019re looking to go vegan once a week, before 6pm \u00e0 la Mark Bittman, or full-on meat-and-dairy-free, Barnett has the experience to prove eating vegan is not all sad salads and seitan.Q: Why did you go vegan?A: I contracted Lyme disease when I was 20. The first time I got sick, I went deep into western medicine, taking six different antibiotics and antimalarials for 18 months. The pills do pretty intensive damage to your gut and immune system. I relapsed less than a year later and realized I had a chronic illness, not just a one-time problem. I was faced with a choice: Do I go back to taking pills and hoping they work? Or do I rethink the way I live my life? I went to a center that specializes in raw veganism for three weeks and went from being too weak to walk six blocks and needing 2\u20133 naps a day to walking comfortably and being able to stay awake the entire day. Changing my diet changed my life.Q: Was it intimidating at all?A: To think about having a chronic illness AND only being able to eat a certain way for the rest of my life was really scary. I spent the rest of my recovery reading all about veganism because if I was going to dramatically change my diet, I wanted to know how to do it right. I looked at it from a spiritual side, an environmental side, a practical recipe-based side, and I armed myself with knowledge.Q: Any books you recommend?A: The China Study by T. Colin Campbell, Eating Animals by Jonathan Safran Foer, and The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma by Michael Pollan.Q: Favorite vegan food?A: I love maitake mushrooms so much. I love when they\u2019re the stars of any dish.Q: What\u2019s a day of typical eating look like?A: I\u2019m on an avocado toast phase right now. For lunch, I eat Dig Inn. For dinner, I do Vietnamese fresh rolls with hoisin-marinated roasted tofu, steamed sweet potato, julienned carrots and cucumbers, cilantro, mint. I roll the rice paper like a burrito, then dip it in peanut sauce if I\u2019m ambitious \u2014 or hoisin sauce with sriracha if I\u2019m lazy.Q: Your perfect Dig Inn bowl?A: Greens, cashew kale Caesar, maple cauliflower, and tofu with sriracha.Q: Your pantry essentials?A: Hummus, black beans, hoisin sauce, tortillas (they\u2019re a great underrated vehicle for roasted vegetables), and citrus to brighten up salads.Q: Any tips to feeling full and satisfied?A: Why do people think they\u2019re not going to be full when they\u2019re vegan? I don\u2019t struggle with that at all. I try to add protein to my meals in unique and creative ways. I never think, \u201cI need this chunk of protein.\u201d Instead, I\u2019ll think, \u201cCan I put beans and lentils in this salad?\u201d If I\u2019m making tacos, I\u2019ll add black beans. I\u2019ll blend pepitas into a dressing or garnish a salad with almonds or cashews.Q: When you\u2019re sourcing ingredients for the restaurants, does your veganism play a role?A: If I serve meat to people, I want it to be the best meat we can source. That\u2019s the standard I apply to everything we serve: I want it to be the best thing you\u2019ve ever had, taste-wise and quality-wise.Q: What about when you\u2019re developing recipes for our menu?A: I believe it\u2019s my responsibility to shepherd along this process of putting out really amazing food. How can I advocate for a menu when I haven\u2019t fully engaged with the product? I\u2019m not dogmatic about my diet. If I\u2019m traveling and someone welcomes me in and offers me food, am I going to turn it down because I\u2019m a vegan? No. I went to Spain, and I ate fish. Day in and day out, I\u2019m a vegan. But am I going to enter into stressful situations due to my dietary restrictions? I\u2019m going to live in the moment, enjoy it, and eat food with joy.Q: Non-vegan foods you miss?A: Homemade pizzas I made with my parents growing up. I was never into cheese, so I\u2019m a really lucky vegan. Pumpkin pie! That\u2019s what I miss the most.Q: What does veganism mean to you?A: Being vegan is part of living healthfully. It\u2019s what you eat, it\u2019s physical activity, it\u2019s mindfulness, intention, how you spend your time, the positive energy of friends you surround yourself with, and the work you do. I wanted to work for a company that shared my values and facilitated my lifestyle, and I\u2019ve been able to maintain my veganism through Dig Inn.Thinking about going vegan, even for just one lunch?

It is not a diet. There are no food restrictions or recommendations. There is no counting calories or fat grams or carbohydrates. It is simply paying attention to what you are eating and how you feel when you eat it.Sounds kind of easy, right?But when was the last time you ate a meal, sitting down, with no distractions, for at least 20 minutes? That means no phone, no iPad, no book or Kindle or newspaper. That means no getting up in the middle of the meal to do some task you just remembered. Or standing in front of the television while spooning your breakfast cereal in your mouth. Or sitting at your desk eating your sandwich while answering emails.Maybe not as easy as it first sounded.Mindful eating is a simple practice that when done consistently, offers tremendous benefits.It\u2019s something I have done off and on for a couple of years. When I\u2019m in the practice of doing it, everything is better.I feel better about myself.My digestion is better.My eating is under control.I make the right decisions about what foods to eat.I feel more comfortable in my clothes.I don\u2019t crave things or have moments of crazed binge eating.Food doesn\u2019t control me.I decide what and when I want to eat.I don\u2019t succumb to every stray thought that tells me to open the fridge to see what\u2019s there.The benefits of mindful eating are well researched and documented. Dr. Susan Albers is a psychologist for the Cleveland Clinic and has written 5 books on mindful eating. She lists three general ways in which mindful eating can benefit someone.In other words, mindful eating works in the same way mindful meditation works. With practice, you become more aware of your thoughts and less susceptible to being yanked around by them. It gives you the space to pause and make a choice before shoving that cookie in your mouth.So why is it so hard to do? If everything is better when I do it, why can\u2019t I just keep doing it?I have mantras that help me through the times when I\u2019m struggling.When I\u2019m feeling the need to snack mindlessly while working, I say to myself\u201cCreate Space\u201d.Or when I have the overwhelming urge to pop bites of food in my mouth while I\u2019m preparing dinner, I say to myself,\u201cDon\u2019t eat before you eat.\u201dThese silly little mantras actually work when I remember to say them. The words help to slow down my thoughts and pause long enough to realize they are merely thoughts and I have a choice of whether to act on them or not.But why does it stop working? Where do the wheels come off the track? Why does weakness take over and my strong will crumble?Even now as sit here writing this, I have the thought that getting up to go to the fridge might help me find the right words that I need to continue this post.Surely, no part of that thought is true. When did food become my sole source of comfort?There\u2019s another great doctor who is doing some positive work in the mindful eating arena. His name is Judson Brewer and he has a fantastic smart phone app called Eat Right Now. It is a 30 day program, teaching you the basics of mindful eating. Each day has a short video and lesson about mindful eating followed by a simple practice to perform that day.When I was doing the program, I had the will of Ironman. The videos and the lessons worked. The practices made sense. I was happy with the results.But like so many good habits, without the proper attention and focus, they can easily slip away. Mindful eating, just as mindful meditation, or any mindfulness practice, requires diligence and discipline.But an even greater component of this practice is patience and self compassion. It\u2019s important to remember that there\u2019s a lot wrapped up in our relationship with food. On the one hand, we need food to fuel us, give us energy, and make our bodies function. On the other hand, food is often used as a reward, treat, or as a way to soothe and comfort in times of sadness or even excitement.Food sensitivities, allergies, and intolerances add even more complexity to our relationship with it. Our brains are directly affected by what we eat. Food can cause cravings, mood swings, brain fog, memory loss, depression and a whole host of other symptoms that we may not immediately recognize as coming from a food source.Mindful eating can help us to recognize these cause and effect reactions. Paying attention to what we eat and how we feel before, during and after eating can illuminate many seemingly unrelated feelings or symptoms.We are living in a time where toxins are at the highest rate in history. Even small levels of exposure can build up over many years and slowly wreak havoc on our systems. Yet the slow build up can cause us not to notice the small effects. Or we write it off as part of getting older. But if we are practicing mindful eating, we are more likely to see the direct correlation of how we feel from what we put inside of our bodies.So while I have been struggling with my own mindful eating practice, I have to remind myself that there are many factors at play and what I need most is non- judgmental self compassion. That is the foundation of any mindfulness practice.If you\u2019d like to begin a mindful eating practice, I highly recommend checking out Dr. Susan Albers website or Judson Brewer\u2019s smart phone app.For some free guided mindful eating meditations, check out the Center for Mindful Eating website or the Insight Timer app, which has a great meditation that I use often.Written byWritten by","5004":"They say we grow the most when we are faced with change.Well, very few things change you as much as hitting rock bottom. At some point in life, this planet will hand you some very tough circumstances that will leave you in the deepest trenches for some amount of time, wondering how you will dig yourself out and when you will see the light of day again.There is nothing left to be desired about hitting rock bottom. Rock bottom usually comes with the feeling of depression.And when you are depressed everything you try to do carries so much resistance, especially if it is the first time being depressed in your life time.Everything you do becomes so difficult. It takes so much effort. Making every moment of every single day an absolute nightmare.What you do when you arrive there is very important to your future.You don\u2019t have to remain in the trenches, you always have a choice in how you choose to respond to a rock bottom scenario. You can choose to focus on what you can change. Or what you can\u2019t. What you are grateful for and what you can work towards. Or what you won\u2019t.The worst thing you can do, though, is decide to stay down there forever. But don\u2019t worry about doing that because I believe no one stays in a dark hole forever.It took a while for me to piece this together but I found six things that help me each single time I hit rock bottom and maybe they can help you too.Pain will make you take action.It is uncomfortable and foreign to our bodies, most people don\u2019t want it in them and they will be moved to act. Pain may just be the motivation that you have always needed to make the necessary changes in your life. So do not ignore it.Use it, to not let yourself settle for nothing less than what you deserve.Use your pain to ignite your inner strength and bravery. You can do anything if you want it badly enough. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, take the negative stuff that\u2019s weighing you down and turn it into motivation.To leave the depths of rock bottom feel the pain but use it as a source of motivation that will propel you upwards.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be down there alone.\u201dThat stamen doesn\u2019t mean dragging others to the bottom with you but reaching out to them instead. Sometimes, the weight of our problems seems too much to bear alone, so don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the people who love and care about you.If you can find even one person that cares for you and can help you out, it will do wonders for you.Reach out to your close ones and let them help you out. Any push that they can give you will go a long way for you, trust me on this one.The ones that love and care for you will happily lend you a helping hand a shoulder to cry on if you need it, because they want to see you thriving once again.Rock bottom offers you the chance to start all over again without any of the pressure that comes from the expectations of yourself and of other people.Think of this moment as the perfect time for you to get rid of negative people and start all over again.It\u2019s a chance for you to come up with a new vision for your life and find a new network of people to tap into. You can create new beliefs, values and principles for which you want to base your life on. You can have a new work ethic if you want to.Hitting reset every once in a while is actually good for you, so do it every time you hit the bottom and build a strong foundation for your future.J.K Rowling, author of the Harry Porter sequel, actually once said that:\u201cRock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.\u201dYou can do the same. Rebuild.I bet when you were at the top or thought you were at the top, you assumed you knew it all. Chances are that is one of the reasons why you are down there.So take the lessons and be a good student.Learn from what went wrong. Learn about who you are as a person. Learn about what you want to do. Learn about the people in your life, watch their reactions to your fall. Learn, Learn, Learn.Learn everything you can and use it to move forward and make progress.With each hardship you gain a new sense of clarity, and you develop the vision to see your life better than it is right now.The realization that you have nothing else to lose should push you to take action on some, if not all, the ideas that you have wanted to bring to life.\u201cThe good thing about being at the bottom is that the only way to go\u2026is up.\u201dWell that is true. You are at the lowest of the low, you can\u2019t get any further. Rock bottom is as far as it gets which means the only way is up.Any action you take will either fail or succeed. When you have failed hard and are at your last wits you really don\u2019t have much to lose and any failure that you experience now will just be a learning experience for you, and any win will serve the purpose of lifting you off the ground.Either way it is now a Win-Win situation for you.You cannot change past mistakes or regrets; you cannot predict or alter what\u2019s going to happen next. You can only make the most out of this moment, so make it a good one.Maybe what you need to get out of rock bottomville is some gratitude.This is the best time for you to be grateful for what you still have\u2026 That is if you still have anything. Take a look at the people still standing next to you during your failures and realize their true priceless value.The small things that you still have are things that you can still be grateful for. Your sense of humor that is lifting up your spirits. A roof over your head. An education and the savings that you may still have. The opportunities that are being given to you now.It could be much worse.There is always something to be grateful. Find it.Remember that you are ten times stronger than you think you are.And that there are a lot of creative ways that you can get yourself back to the top of the mountain. The given ways provided above are just a few of them which are meant to help you take that one step that will get you closer to achieving that goal.Even if you feel buried beneath life\u2019s circumstances and don\u2019t see any way out of the hole you\u2019re in, don\u2019t worry. The universe will always seek to guide you in a direction that will benefit you the most and come out on top.Have you been to trenches? How did you get out?

Biohacking is the future, and it\u2019s development has been rapid and recent. Biohacking will impact your life sooner or later \u2014 and maybe it already has. If you\u2019ve taken steps to better understand your body, your DNA, and your potential, that\u2019s biohacking. If you\u2019ve pursued ways to improve your physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, or cellular health, that\u2019s biohacking. And it\u2019s so much more than that.Biohacking: In a NutshellBiohacking is using science and technology to become the absolute best version of yourself. Essentially, it\u2019s using all of the tools we have at our disposal to improve our lives. Modern science is addressing each and every potential illness, injury, issue, inconvenience, or physical limit facing human bodies today. We are learning everything we can about our own biology, as well as finding ways to \u201chack\u201d that biology.\u201cHacking\u201d has long served a negative connotation. But as you probably know, we now use \u201chack\u201d to define any type of creative optimizing. For example, when you find a creative solution to an everyday problem you may call it a \u201clife hack.\u201d A tweak to how furniture is normaly assembled from the manufacturer\u2019s instructions is an \u201cIKEA hack\u201d\u2014you get the drift. Hacking is the creative problem solving to improve one\u2019s life, and we are turning the focus on our bodies and biology.Biohacking: Why?Biohacking has actually been used for centuries. Human beings are always looking to maximize their performance, from the days of hunter-gatherers to modern Olympians. It\u2019s not just about being bigger and faster, either. It\u2019s about whatever is important to you and your body\u2019s functioning. Science and technology are focusing intensely on biohacking to change lives. One of my favorite topics of focus in Biohacking is finding ways to unlock the brain\u2019s potential. How can brain teasing puzzles, nutrition, and even sleep be combined to provide the brain with everything it needs to train up to its maximum potential?Biohacking is the answer to the question \u201cHow can we improve lives?\u201d We can help wounded veterans learn to walk again. We can fight the deterioration of mind and body through aging. We can protect the vulnerable and ease the strain on those who use their bodies and strength for skilled work. We can improve daily function, baseline health, productivity, appearance, and lifespan. So really the question ought to be, why not biohack?Biohacking: AnalyticsThe first and most accessible step of biohacking is real time analytics of our biology. We first must understand our own biology and what is happening in our bodies. Bioanalytics is a growing field that is dedicated to tracking your body function and vitals in order to help you make more informed decisions for improvement.Wearable analytic technology is everywhere \u2014 you may be wearing one right now. If you\u2019re tracking steps, heart rate, blood sugar, or other metrics then you\u2019re already biohacking through analytics. The options are wide, and ever-growing, for ways to track and analyze your biological performance. You might be someone who doesn\u2019t enjoy wearing watch style apparel, or maybe you love wearing watches and feel awkward about wearing two bands on your arm at once. I completely understand that and I personally switched to a discrete ring style monitor that tracks my activity and sleep habits. The most important factor is tracking your biology to determine what to change and track the progress of your efforts.Wearable tech isn\u2019t the end-all-be-all when it comes to Analytics. There are a myriad of affordable test that help us understand what is happening on out insides. For example, the topic of gut biome is becoming an ever increasing topic of conversation in the Biohacking world. There are tests that can be done that give you the ability to know exactly what is happening in your gut. Taking a general step to improve your gut is good, knowing the exact bacteria to cultivate based on gut populations is better.Passive analysis can tell us a great deal, or more intensive tracking and comparison can address direct questions you may have about your health. In the future, we look to monitoring even more about our bodies and using the logistics to create a personalized biohacking plan.Biohacking: TechnologyTechnology is rapidly rising to meet the needs of the biohacker generation. The purpose of technology has always been to make our lives easier, so naturally we are applying that to our health and wellness. Bio technology is no longer confined to medical centers, though. We are finding and applying biohacking technology to create miracles in everyday life.Wearable technology inspires millions by allowing someone a prosthetic that not only fits them perfectly, but allows for normal function. Exoskeletons are being used for both protection and support in the military, for skilled workers, and even athletes. And could jetpacks actually work? Yes, and we\u2019re probably not too far from seeing them in real life.Internal technology can sound like something from a science-fiction movie, but it\u2019s a reality that could save your life. Smart technology can be implanted into your body to improve hearing, track medication usage, and even promote healing.Biohacking: EnvironmentWe have learned that by adjusting our environments we can change and nudge our biology in the right direction. The science is still developing on the ways our environments can dramatically affect our bodies and health, but what we\u2019ve already discovered is intriguing.Cryotherapy has been useful for ages. If you venture into the training rooms for many professional sports teams you may find a tank with warm water and a tank with iced water. Cold environments especially intense cold that comes from ice baths may help reduce inflammation and promote faster healing. These biohacks can be as simple and taking a cold shower or as complicated as stepping into a professional Cryochamber.Oxygenation chambers can rejuvenate cells and encourage blood vessel growth. Removing toxins or infusing the air with helpful compounds is environmental biohacking that you can use in your homes right now.Biohacking: NutritionNutrition has been a foundation of health and medicine from the Dark Ages. And now we know so much more than the Dark Ages. Of course we all know not to overeat or to forget fruits and veggies, but nutritional biohacking is so much more important than that. Biohacking nutrition means identifying deficiencies and problems, or desirable goals we wish to achieve, then creating a nutritional portfolio designed to achieve that biological outcome.You may choose to improve your memory, promote healthy aging, boost energy, combat illnesses or disorders, or lose weight. Through biohacking you can assess your current nutrition, determine a goal, and create a plan that could include diet, supplements, fitness, and beauty products. Controlling what goes in and on your body is the simplest and most immediately applicable form of biohacking \u2014 to great effect.Biohacking: What\u2019s Next?The most exciting thing about biohacking is that we have little idea of what comes next. The potential is so vast and the science is developing rapidly. We may one day live in a world with only completely healthy, able-bodied, happy people. We may be able to swear off illness and injury. We may be able to stretch the limits of what our bodies can do, beyond what we ever thought possible.It\u2019s all within the realm of biohacking, and we\u2019re all about exploring. Exploring our own biology, exploring our own potential. What can your body do? We invite you to find out.If you liked the read, hold down that clap button!Ryan Goodwin is both a professional biohacker and Chief Marketing Officer at LifeVantage, a company at the forefront of a brand new emerging science called nutrigenomics. Simply defined, nutrigenomics is the study of how nutrients and natural compounds affect our genes.

You even have in mind that little project at home. Then something or someone interrupts those plans. How do you handle those little life interruptions?My husband and I recently had the opportunity to test our mindset and capabilities to handle an interruption in how our home is arranged.Our three-year-old grandson who stays overnight with us one night a week, had been sneezing the last few visits. This past Monday morning in particular, he was sneezing, sniffling, and had a runny nose.I checked in with my daughter to see if those things continued after they left that morning. Nope! Oh no! We recognized those clear signs of cat allergies, since both our children grew up with them.On the advice of his doctor, the decision was made to move his bed from my office \u2014 his toddler bedroom where the cat likes to hang out- to my husband, Jim\u2019s wood floor office \u2014 where the cat is NOT allowed.Interruption!! All hands on deck!Switch out one double bed for one toddle bed? Easy peasy, right? Not a chance.Thus began the dance of the furniture and the moving of the stuff.Now some of you may have very simplistic offices. Jim and I don\u2019t. We have books, papers, filing cabinets. Visualize learner bees and collectors of \u201cstuff\u201d. He has genealogy as a hobby and I am a life coach\/spiritual director.However, in this simple life interruption of the swap out of two beds, here\u2019s what I discovered about mindsets and handling life\u2019s little interruptionsBecause we had an overarching driver- my grandson\u2019s health- for the interruption of our day-to-day living routine, it made it easier to drop everything else we were doing and go with the flow.Move and change the room arrangements.Instead of a fixed, judging mindset, of why us right now? , how much work do we really have to do? , we found ourselves moving into action and problem-solving \u2014 a learner mindset \u2014 of how can we make this work for everyone involved:\u2014 our grandson\u2019s toddler bed and curious mind, Jim\u2019s office space, my office space and the guest double bed. No time for a pity party.According to Carol Dwek in her book, Mindset, the Psychology of Success, we always have an internal dialogue going in our minds.A growth mindset is attuned to the implications of learning and constructive actions- such as \u2018let\u2019s see how I can improve my office setting as we rearrange furniture\u201d.A fixed mindset could be stuck in judging the situation as \u201cI\u2019ll never get my office back to any kind of order again.\u201d Or \u201cThis will never work.\u201dBy going with the flow of learning, a growth mindset, constructive actions appeared more readily.In the midst of the chaos of moving furniture from one room to the other in a short time period, it is easy to get tired and grumpy. Those of you with spouses and furniture moving know what I mean. It\u2019s hard to keep each of you on the same page, especially when getting tired.Also we have noticed as we get older, our pacing and strength are not what they once were. Don\u2019t get me wrong. We are in great shape for our age.In fact, in our heads, we still twenty years younger. However our bodies somehow don\u2019t agree with that assessment.We took breaks between moving filing cabinets, disassembling desks, moving bookcases, so that we could feel like our spaces could be our own, as well as have the room ready for our grandson who was coming the next day.A project always grow disproportionately to the time you have for it.Asking for help seems different, too. We are so used to doing it ourselves. We have pieces of furniture still ready to go to the basement, but those pieces will wait until our younger daughter can help carry them down to the basement. .Finally, when the dust settles, the cat hair cleaned up and the rooms are back in some semblance of order, we have taken a sign of relief.I am actually grateful for this interruption given to us by our grandson. My office is lighter, airy, less cluttered. All my filing cabinets are now in my walk-in closet, to be used for storage.I feel lighter because my space is more simplistic and orderly, even with the double guest bed in it.My husband is enjoying his office space as well. His office turned out much more open and organized. This life interruption had good things written all over it \u2014 for our grandson\u2019s health and for us.When has a life interruption turn into a good change for you?How did you adjust your mindset so you could go with the flow and ask for any help you needed?In the end, how did you take time to reflect on the graces that the interruption brought you?I believe interruptions are not always pleasant, yet how we approach them can make a huge difference on our attitudes and ultimately the outcome of the interruptions.Interruptions can actually lead to more nourishment in your life as this one has for me. I would love to know how you let them nourish your life.I know two big outcomes from this interruption will be a healthier, happy grandson and a more productive writer as I enjoy a less cluttered office.

Between that\u2026and having to always work full time\u2026I have felt like motherhood, what I wanted more than nearly anything in this world, has been both gypped and marred. My short-comings seem to line this noble calling with failures aflame.Much has changed in my life just recently. After twenty years of being an educator, I have resigned. I now am in the presence of a second chance at parenting.However, is it too late? I\u2019ve agonized over this.Then, I read Patty Scott\u2019s book, Parenting Teens through Chaos & Crisis. Honestly, I don\u2019t feel that my hubby and I have had too much chaos and crisis brought on by our teenage son (yet), but so much comfort enveloped me when I read Patty\u2019s words:\u201cThe teen years are like a parenting do-over. Whatever you didn\u2019t get right when they were little can be corrected and done differently in adolescence.\u201dCould this be true? Is this a glimmer of hope for my son and for me?I have a second chance to ameliorate our family dynamics. I\u2019m a fan of second chances, and I\u2019m relieved to have one now.My little boy is becoming a young man, and I want him to know that I realize I haven\u2019t been the perfect mom. I choose to apologize where I have \u201cbungled it as a parent\u201d because as Patty mentions, \u201cAdmitting where you botched it and attempting to heal the relationship will go miles\u2026\u201dShe guides us in positive ways to interact with our young adult children, avoiding power struggles and seeking win-win situations. She gives examples of how to provide a counterbalance to what our teens intake from life outside the home. It\u2019s time for me to focus my time and energy into \u201cpouring in the good\u201d, choosing consequences that can actually be enforced on a boundary-pushing teen, being available to my boy, and being his advocate and building him up. It\u2019s time for me to parent by being a \u201cconsultant and ally\u201d instead of just the provider and authority.Patty Scott\u2019s book launches February 28, 2018.

We can dish it out and we stockpile it for ourselves. By the time our children reach the teen years, we have poured a lot of mothering into their lives. Some of that has been amazing. Other contributions \u2014 when we raised our voice, were impatient, or demanded more from them than was reasonable \u2014 were not the best.The teen years are hard on even the best of families. I know adolescents who are choosing to stay out of the fray. They decide not to have premarital sex and avoid using drugs and alcohol. This does not mean their lives are unscathed. Many of these same teens struggle with depression, anxiety, peer pressure, mood swings and relational difficulties. When they do, they tend to take out their emotions on their family.Other teens we know are not avoiding the pitfalls they face. They have succumbed to the messages of media and social media. They sext and engage in other edgy and even illegal behavior as they throw off the shackles of their parents\u2019 expectations. It goes without saying that moms of these teens are distraught and the family life in these homes is often turbulent.What happens to us mothers as we face various hardships with our teens? We tend to search back through our parenting archives and drudge up memories of mom-fails. We end up feeling a bit responsible for all that is going on in the heart and life of our teenagers. We start to believe we caused the difficulties in our adolescent. If only we had parented differently. If we had been more firm or more lenient, spent more time, given more space, or done some other key action, our child would not be the way they are. We give ourselves way too much credit and in the process we end up carrying a ton of unnecessary and unhelpful guilt. I know because I\u2019ve been down that road with my own teen son.Guilt is a relatively useless emotion. We tend to use it to beat ourselves up and in the process we stay stuck in the past, unable to move forward into a productive future. Remorse is a different matter. We can experience a type of sorrow which leads us to make a change. When we forgive ourselves and let go of whatever we did in the past, we are freed up to effectively parent.I struggled with this process as my teen son entered his 14th summer. We were seeing signs of rebellion in him which gave me great anxiety along with constant waves of guilt. It was in a counseling session that the dam cracked open and I saw that I didn\u2019t cause the challenges my son was facing. Releasing my guilt allowed me to start to be able to focus more on what he needed now in this season of his life.Through that experience and the ensuing few years of parenting him through some chaotic times and several crises, I started talking more intimately with other moms of teenagers. I found I am far from alone in my emotions and concerns. Most of us are facing some anxiety and we feel ill equipped to navigate the teen years. These conversations spurred me to write a book, \u201cParenting Your Teen Through Chaos & Crisis.\u201dIn the book I help moms release guilt. I also talk about letting go of control and learning to take the role of influencer in the life of your teen. While sharing from my life and my professional knowledge (with my Masters in Marriage and Family Therapy), I help moms of teens see where they do have power to choose. Moms will learn how to allow consequences to potentially shape the choices their teen is making. I wrap up the book by talking about ways to cultivate a positive relationship with a teenager. I remind moms of the importance of having an extended network of support as I share various ways to pursue connections. In eight manageable chapters, I aim to equip moms to weather the storms of the teen years and not only survive, but thrive through this season of motherhood.The book launches on Amazon on February 28th in both print and ebook formats. If you are raising a preteen, teen or know someone who is, I hope this book will provide hope and encouragement as well as some solid practical help.I also write weekly at https:\/\/heartshomeward.com to inspire moms to love intentionally while making room for what matters most. If you want to be a part of a supportive group of caring moms who are committed to mothering well, join us on Facebook in the Intentional Motherhood Community.Written byWritten by","5189":"It was a tough day. That morning, I was asked to step in and help a woman, Bertha, in crisis. I didn\u2019t know all the details and frankly, I didn\u2019t need to. Handling a crisis isn\u2019t about solving the situation; it\u2019s about helping the person calm themselves down so they are in control of themselves again.It was now evening and the role had changed. Having successfully resolved the crisis, the goal now was to help Bertha process her experiences from that morning and create an action plan to get her moving forward on the road to mental health.\u201cI scared myself this morning,\u201d Bertha shared with me. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to feel like that again. I feel like I should be able to handle this, you know?\u201dThere are a few statements that bring whatever plans I have to a full screeching stop, and Bertha hit on perhaps the biggest one: \u201cI should be able to handle this.\u201dLife is chaos, and chaos destabilizes everyone.Let\u2019s take a step back and acknowledge that life gets too big for everyone at some point in our lives, regardless of the presence of a mental illness. Everyone hits a crisis point, a point at which they look around at themselves and their lives and wonder how they got to that point. Life is chaos, and chaos destabilizes everyone.Now add in the distorting effects of a mental illness and all expectations of \u201chandling this\u201d go out the window entirely. These distorting effects go beyond the emotional; our environment is often more chaotic. We may have an addiction or live with an alcoholic or addict; we may be in an abusive relationship or modeling our relationships after examples set by ill parents. We are more likely to have a child who requires special attention. Add to these distorting factors the normal stresses of an ill parent, finances, or career, and it becomes unreasonable to expect to be able to handle it all.Worse, mental illness distorts our perception of circumstances. We look at each piece and minimize its true magnitude. I know people who live with most of the circumstances listed above (just one example: caring for a grandchild while in an abusive relationship with an alcoholic or addicted spouse and also acting as the primary caretaker for a parent. This same person insists that none of it is a big deal.Mental illness distorts our perception of circumstances.For the sake of argument, let\u2019s agree that it may be reasonable to expect someone to handle one of the above situations (I still disagree with that argument, but let\u2019s move along). However, expecting someone to handle two or even more of those is not a recipe for success. They have too much going on, too many people pulling at them, and expecting them to handle it all with grace, and compassion is, at best, unreasonable.There is something about the struggle of living with anxiety or depression that seems to drive us even harder to insist \u201cI got this; it\u2019s OK.\u201d We don\u2019t think of ourselves as strapping on our superhero cloak when dealing with life, and yet that\u2019s often what we are doing. Our superhero cloak is merely made of cloth and is not imbued with elements that give us the superhero ability of handling more life than others do.Has this message gotten through yet? You should not be able to handle everything you are living with. Collapsing is normal. Fighting as hard as you are and struggling to succeed as you wish is not a sign of incompetence or weakness; it is a testament to your strength and your will.Our superhero cloak is merely made of cloth and is not imbued with elements that give us the superhero ability of handling more life than others do.If you need help seeing this, I\u2019m asking you to take out a sheet of paper and write down everything you have going on. Avoid sugarcoating the situation; this is the opportunity for an honest appraisal. Write it all down, including every little expectation, responsibility, or stressor you live with, such as going to the grocery store and doing laundry and your diagnosis (or expected diagnosis, if you don\u2019t have a formal one).Now put your best friend\u2019s name at the top of it and imagine that this is their life. What would you say to them? Should they be able to handle this? If your answer is \u201cno\u201d for them, then it\u2019s also \u201cno\u201d for you. You are not more superhuman than they are; there is no \u201cyes, but for me\u201d that changes anything.Fighting as hard as you are and struggling to succeed as you wish is not a sign of incompetence or weakness; it is a testament to your strength and your will.So, my dear Bertha, I don\u2019t expect you to be able to handle this. In fact, with what I know of your situation now, I\u2019m in awe that it took you as long as it did to go into crisis. You\u2019ve \u201chandled it\u201d amazingly, and some days we are simply unable to go on as we have been, or to handle what we could yesterday or will be able to tomorrow. You are not a disappointment; you are not letting anyone down. You are amazing, and it\u2019s OK to not be OK.Father, I ask you grant comfort to all those who are reading this message. Help them understand that we are only humans, and imperfect humans at that. Help us see the truth of our situation and reach out for the help we need, whatever form that aid looks like. I ask that you guide them to the answers and the help needed so that they may be a shining reminder of your grace, love, and mercy. Amen.Hi there!

And then let go of it.Life\u2019s a constant succession of forks in the road and plenty of them lead to tattoo parlours, STD clinics and divorce lawyers.Question is how to do better next time?For a long time, philosophers and economists agreed that good decision-making was based on the triumph of reason over emotion.With advances in neuroscience, we now know that emotions play at least as big a role as logic.While the rational parts of our brain are centred in the frontal lobes, most of our emotional structures are based in the Amygdala, deep in the brain\u2019s medial temporal lobe.People with damaged Amygdala don\u2019t feel emotions in the same way as others. They struggle to make even the most elementary decisions.They provide evidence that effective decision-making is impossible without the meaning and motivation we assign to it through our emotional input.In other words, without accessing our emotions choosing literally becomes impossible.American psychologist Barry Schwartz divides decision-makers into two categories, maximisers and satisficers.Maximisers are perfectionists. They\u2019ll consider every possible alternative imaginable because they want to be certain that every decision or purchase they make is the best they can possibly make.Satisficers think differently. They have certain minimum criteria they want to see fulfilled, but they\u2019re quite happy to settle for any option they feel is good enough, even if it\u2019s not necessarily the best option in all respects.Research shows that satisficers on the whole lead far less stressful lives and are consistently happier than choice maximisers.Schwartz blames what he calls the curse of discernment, where the maximiser\u2019s rising expectations in life can no longer keep pace with the choices he or she is presented with.He proposes a simple solution:\u201cIf you\u2019re out to find \u2018good enough\u2019, a lot of the pressure is off and the task of choosing something in the sea of limitless choice becomes more manageable.\u201dSo while good enough might not be your best choice, it\u2019ll probably make you the happiest.Settling for good enough doesn\u2019t necessarily mean settling for the safe option.As entrepreneur and writer, Derek Sivers puts it:\u201cEvery time you\u2019re making a choice, one choice is the safe\/comfortable choice, and one choice is the risky\/uncomfortable choice. The risky\/uncomfortable choice is the one that will teach you the most and make you grow the most, so that\u2019s the one you should choose.\u201dEven if your choice doesn\u2019t play as well as you\u2019d hoped for, having pushed your skills and capabilities to the next level is a great result in itself.After all:\u201cA mind that is stretched by a new experience can never return to its old position.\u201d \u2014 Oliver Wendell Jones JrBelow are the thirteen most common reasons why you may end up regretting the decisions we make, and advice on how to do better next time.Choice overload leads to choice paralysis.If you\u2019re a maximiser, the sheer volume of choices means you may no longer be able to do the maths.So you decide not to choose.If you\u2019re a satisficer, you get equally worn down.There are too many options available, so instead of finding out which option fulfils your minimum criteria, you settle for the one that seems easiest.Overload also makes it more likely you\u2019ll regret your choice later on and encourages you to regret the alternative choices you didn\u2019t make.Professor Sheena Iyengar at Columbia Business School call this the paradox of choice.\u201cAdding options to people\u2019s lives can\u2019t help but increasing people\u2019s ideas about how good those options will be. This will produce less satisfaction with the produced results even if those results are good results.\u201dWith peak state, I don\u2019t mean being medicated on margaritas and that mystery bag you found on the dance floor. Unless you enjoy having your face tattooed.According to author Benjamin Hardy, a peak state is when you\u2019re in a position of growth and flow, a state of passion.Making decisions outside of a peak state will make your choices weak and small-minded.The best way to put yourself in such a state is to get out of your routine and spend time in an environment that\u2019s optimal for learning and growth.Take yourself out to the countryside for a couple of days. Spend time in nature, be inspired, meditate and move around.There\u2019s logic in the idea that the more information you have, the better decision you make.But after you reach a certain threshold, any additional information will only confuse you.It\u2019s in our nature to try and fill in the information gaps as a way to reduce uncertainty.Unfortunately, this information quest can quickly lead us down some rabbit holes, especially with information so easy to come by.The process, therefore, isn\u2019t so much about finding out more information, it\u2019s about finding the right information.As Psychologist Ron Friedman points out:\u201cIn a world where every click brings the promise of a discovery, we\u2019re all at risk of becoming addicts. The challenge lies in differentiating between questions worth exploring and questions best left unasked.\u201dWe find it easy to remember who we were ten years ago.Yet, for some reason, we find it much harder to imagine who we might be in ten years\u2019 time. And because we can\u2019t imagine it, we mistakenly think it\u2019s not going to happen.When we make decisions we follow a process called affective forecasting, where we try and predict how the outcomes of that decision will make us feel in the future.Trouble is we routinely overestimate the impact of the decisions we\u2019re about to make, no matter whether we think the outcome will be good or bad.In the words of Kate Douglas:\u201cRemember that whatever the future holds, it\u2019ll probably hurt or please you less than you imagine.\u201dUnless that choice involves late-night carbs or a face tattoo.If you\u2019re an indecisive procrastinator, you\u2019re probably not someone I\u2019d like to go shopping with.You find it hard to make up your mind because you know that committing to a particular choice leads to the loss of many alternative choices.You also know there\u2019s social pressure to stick to that choice once you\u2019ve made it.The anxiety caused by this internal battle makes it tempting not to choose and instead bury your head in the sand a little while longer.In the end, the only decision you make is to withdraw to the last remaining place where you feel truly safe, Netflix.Always set yourself a deadline for when a decision needs to be made if you want to avoid ending up in procrastination hell.Most economies are fixated on the idea that plenty of choices must be a good thing.It only takes a trip to any US diner to experience the opposite.As a European, having to choose between ten different fries is deeply distressing, and so is the over the top friendly waitress.Even if I enjoy the fries I chose after long deliberation, the thought of not having chosen the best fries causes stress.Here\u2019s a tip.The moment you realise you\u2019re unable to obtain the right information or knowledge in order to make a choice, is the moment you delegate it to someone who can.So if you can\u2019t tell a Malbec from a Merlot, let your dinner date pick the wine.And if he takes you to a US diner, always choose the Disco Fries.Satisficers take note: Always. Do. Your. Homework.That homework involves having a logical and structured process in place to guide your decision-making.Without a system, you\u2019ll struggle to think of all the necessary factors before you come to a decision.By being systematic you create an environment where you can explore all options, either on your own or as part of a team.From decision-making trees to paired analyses, there are plenty of helpful tools and techniques available online that\u2019ll help you identify and rank your options.Various studies have shown that when we feel happy we\u2019re more likely to be blinded by optimism and the attractiveness of a choice.Feelings of sadness or slight melancholy, on the other hand, encourage a rather more systematic and realistic look at your options.As a rule of thumb:For small decisions always give more weight to rational arguments; for complex decisions give more weight to your emotions.Take note of your physiology.If you feel your body expanding when visualising the likely outcome of a particular choice, that\u2019s a good sign.If you feel your body contracts when visualising the outcome, then that\u2019s usually a bad omen.Personal development 1.0 has brainwashed you to always trust your gut.Bad advice.There are literally hundreds of psychological biases that lead you to make decisions in a blinkered and illogical way.Here are the most common ones to watch out for when making decisions:Listen to your gut as you\u2019d listen to the advice of your slightly prejudiced aunt.Pickled from life and too many G&Ts. But she means well bless her.Maybe your past careful and skilful decision-making earned you a reputation as a great judge and choice expert.But often as you get more confident, you start relying more on gut feeling than on solid analysis.This is where sloppiness and errors of judgment start slipping in.Confirmation bias means you choose to look only at evidence that confirms your existing beliefs or theories. In other words, you get cocky.Don\u2019t just rely on past experience and information which confirms how right you are.Actively seek out information that proves how wrong you might be about your preferred option.Colleagues, family, friends and mentors can have great insights and information that help you make better choices.It\u2019s useful getting others on board early, especially if you depend on them to implement your decisions.If you\u2019re not keen on involving anyone else, or you don\u2019t have access to anyone, apply the technique of trusting the crowd within.Visualise how you would advise a close friend if they presented you with the same scenario and the same options.In psychology, this is known as dialectical bootstrapping.It helps you to step outside your vantage point and to think a little more broad-minded.For a maximiser, this is a tough nut to crack.Author Susan Jeffers suggests switching from a no-win mindset to a no-lose mindset.Instead of questioning whether you made the right decision, a no-lose mindset means reminding yourself that whatever choice you made, it was a good one.After you made your decision, you let go of your expectation and your image of how things are \u2018supposed\u2019 to go.Even if that choice, later on, turns out to be not so well, trust you can handle the consequences, and trust you can handle them well.Plenty of big decisions involve serious financial and emotional investment.These sunk costs often make it impossible for us to walk away, despite mounting evidence that the decision is harming us.After all, you put in all the hard labour, and cutting your losses now would mean accepting defeat publicly.You become so fixated on your choice that you\u2019re not willing to recognise when you need to change course, or when it\u2019s time to choose something different altogether.How do you know when to pull the plug?As Seth Godin says in his book The Dip, the best way to find out whether you\u2019ve reached a dead end is to ask yourself:\u201cIs this a project that is going to respond to my guts, effort and investment?\u201dIf it\u2019s a yes, then commit and invest. If it\u2019s a no, then get the hell out.There\u2019s no such thing as the right choice. Some choices are better than others, so focus on making a decision that\u2019s good enough.When considering your options, find a balance between being systematic and being emotional.

His caresses tell you how badly he wants you. Every part of him says he\u2019s ready. Every part except one. Mr. Happy won\u2019t cooperate. You both keep trying, but nothing happens.Nothing except an apology.Imagine a love scene going perfectly. Then someone farts. The director yells, \u201cCut!\u201d And you have to take a break and start over. Mr. Happy can act a lot like a finicky, demanding director.Embarrassment follows, then shame. You wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with you, or him, or both.Millions of us have been there. Erectile dysfunction sucks. Despite what you hear, lots of men can\u2019t afford Viagra. Their insurance plans don\u2019t cover it. Under state healthcare, it\u2019s easier for me to get birth control than it is for my spouse to buy an affordable ED drug.Lots of employers classify ED treatment as \u201crecreational.\u201d As if my spouse were some 20-something dragging home a different girl every night. To the state, having sex with your wife is just a bonus. Not essential.So we started budgeting for Viagra.About two hundred bucks a month.Unless we wanted to go bankrupt, or file for divorce, we had to find other ways to love each other. We delved into the problem together and learned a lot about this side of health and nutrition.What did we learn? Well, you might not even need Viagra.Erectile dysfunction drugs have finally gone generic.For whatever reason, your doctor might not mention this fact unless you ask specifically. Brand name drugs have almost doubled in price. By the end, we paid $300 for a handful of little blue pills. Finally, we asked about generics. The doctor blinked and said, \u201cWell, there\u2019s Sildenafil.\u201d That costs a quarter of the price. And it works\u2026even better. At least for us.The extra money in our bank account makes us feel more relaxed. As a result, we fuck more often.Your testosterone might be low.Not everybody needs an ED drug. Some men have naturally low testosterone. It turns out that tofu and pesticides like atrazine drop men\u2019s t-levels. Some studies have found that pesticides in certain areas can turn male frogs into female ones. So we bought a water purifier and nixed tofurkey night. My spouse read that red meats, seafood, and eggs can boost testosterone production. So does increased intake of Vitamin D.So nowadays he has a surf & turf dinner once or twice a week. He pops vitamin D pills twice a day. All because he loves me.If that doesn\u2019t work, you can ask your doctor for a t-test. A brand-name testosterone gel can cost even more than Viagra. But local pharmacies often compound their own gels for way cheaper.We learned that the hard way.Again, our doctor knew about local compounding. He\u2019s a nice guy. The second we said, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford Axiron,\u201d he leapt into action.Doctors just don\u2019t think about money, unless you bring it up.Go figure.You can always try GNC. We did, but with mixed results. They\u2019ll sell you 12 kinds of supplements to increase a man\u2019s virility. My spouse tried five. He settled on one that seemed to work wonders for a while. Then it was recalled. Why? Turns out they were illegally splicing their product with Viagra. He tried the modified release. It didn\u2019t work. Surprise. The entire time, he\u2019d basically been taking Viagra. Back to the drawing board.You should take a vacation.Nothing kills an erection like stress. Guys don\u2019t need a medical problem to strike out in bed. A hard week at the office can do just as much damage. Stress raises cortisol levels, and drops testosterone production. Stress also generally kills your libido \u2014 sexual desire. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve got Miranda Kerr on one knee and Margot Robbie on the other. If you\u2019re reliving an argument with a coworker in your head, nobody\u2019s getting laid.Stress can ruin your night.My spouse and I both work highly demanding jobs. A bad day\u2019s inevitable. Some weekends, both of us just want to curl up and sleep. It can be hard to slip into the mood when you know there\u2019s a stack of 30 papers waiting for you. Yes, especially on a Saturday.So we had to make a difficult decision. No matter what fell on our plate, Saturday would be sex day. No email. No grading. No research. We would wake up and spend the entire day together. We might begin with cuddling, watch some porn, and then start fooling around and see where things led. Those little vacations revamped our sex life. Some version of that might help you, too.Talk to your partner.One failed launch can lead to another if you don\u2019t communicate. That happened with us. My spouse clammed up about his ED for an entire month. Why? He felt embarrassed and guilty. He wanted to solve the problem on his own. But you can\u2019t fix ED by yourself. The further you retreat from your partner, the worse things get.Focus on her.Just because you can\u2019t get off, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t please your partner. My spouse wanted me to be happy. So even when he couldn\u2019t rise up, his hand sure could.It took months to get the ED situation fully under control. But knowing that he could satisfy me in other ways helped us both. We still had a great time in bed. Or at least I did, and I know that brought him satisfaction. And it made him feel a lot less guilt and shame. Ironically, ED helped him figure out the mystery of the clit.Sleep and Exercise more.Americans sleep less than ever. We owe that mainly to jobs and smartphones. We did some research into sleep and found that smartphone and tablet screens emit a spectrum of light that tricks your body into thinking it\u2019s day time. It\u2019s no coincidence that we both started losing sleep right around when we bought our first fancy gadgets.We all like to classify sleep as \u201crecreational,\u201d but it\u2019s not. Your body needs that rest to regenerate. That\u2019s when we produce the chemicals and hormones that keep us functional. Skimp on sleep, and you\u2019ll see a sag in your bedroom activities. I guarantee. Same goes with exercise.Insanely rich men can buy all the ED drugs they need. Our leaders get them practically for free. They really don\u2019t give a fuck out women\u2019s reproductive rights, or the average dude\u2019s ED.Stop watching so much porn.If you watch porn every day, you might need to reel that in. I mean, only if you want actual sex. An increasing amount of research points to porn as a culprit in ED. Men consume fantasies to the point that nothing else can arouse them. Digital porn is a drug. You can become addicted.Here\u2019s the catch. How do we define porn? Anytime you seek arousal from a screen or a page, that\u2019s porn. Some forms of pornography do more damage than others. But every brain\u2019s unique.My spouse used to wack off to Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion shows. Yeah, who doesn\u2019t? But he talked to me about that, and he wondered if somehow his consumption of that medium wasn\u2019t hurting his libido.He didn\u2019t stop masturbating. But instead of jerking to YouTube vids, he decided to return to his old friend \u2014 the couch.Remember how much fun it was to masturbate on a flat cushioned surface, compared to an upholstered office chair?According to my spouse, just the simple difference of jerking to imagined fantasies helped almost immediately.So there you have it. We\u2019re not scientists. But after a year, the ED has vanished. Usually, he takes a generic ED drug. But he\u2019s thicker than ever, and our sex is nothing to complain about.ED isn\u2019t just a man\u2019s problem. It\u2019s a relationship problem. My spouse and I learned firsthand.

And so they begin to define us. We forget that we\u2019re constantly changing and that we have the power to make and remake the story of who we are. But when we do remember, the results can be dramatic and turn our lives around.For years, Stephanie struggled with insomnia. When she was in her early thirties, her doctor prescribed a blood pressure\u2013lowering medication for her persistent migraines. The trouble was Stephanie already had low blood pressure, and the drug made it drop even further, making her so anxious that she felt as if she would die if she let herself fall asleep. Instead of identifying the real source of the problem, her physician prescribed sleeping pills. By the time Stephanie consulted another doctor (who immediately discontinued the blood pressure medication), she was hooked on sleeping pills \u2014 and remained addicted to them for the next 20 years.\u201cI hated myself for taking them and tried so many times to stop, but I just couldn\u2019t,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI truly believed that there was something inherently wrong with me and that my body no longer had the capacity to sleep without chemicals. The nights I tried not to take the pills, I\u2019d lie awake for hours, panicking, drenched in sweat, until I finally just gave up and reached for the drug.\u201dBut two years ago, when Stephanie started reading news stories about the dangers of sleeping pills, she became determined to stop taking them. She began meditating more regularly and tried every imaginable herbal remedy; still, she struggled and relapsed off and on for months. It wasn\u2019t until Stephanie identified \u2014 and questioned \u2014 the story she\u2019d been telling herself about how she couldn\u2019t sleep unaided by drugs that she successfully weaned herself off them. \u201cWhen I finally saw clearly that I\u2019d been held captive by this story that was just a story and not the truth, it was as if a lightbulb went on. For the first time in 20 years, I was able to trust my ability to let go and fall asleep on my own,\u201d she says.Ultimately, we\u2019re the only ones who can take a familiar story, one that is encoded in our bodies and minds, and turn it around.Nancy Napier, a trauma therapist, talks about working with people who have been through what she calls \u201cshock trauma,\u201d a huge life disruption \u2014 from dangerous situations, like a terrible car accident or plane crash, to more everyday events, like getting laid off or a breakup in a relationship, that are perceived as huge. The key piece, Napier tells me, is that people\u2019s ordinary lives have been destabilized, and their expectations feel like they have been ripped apart. One of the first things she often says to her clients who have experienced trauma is \u201cyou survived.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d be amazed at how many people for whom that is a real surprise,\u201d Napier explains.If I were choosing captions for snapshots of my early life, they would look like this: \u201cMotherless child.\u201d \u201cAbandoned.\u201d \u201cMy mentally ill father.\u201d \u201cRaised by first-generation immigrants.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how to be like everyone else.\u201d Pain, upheaval, and fear brought me to seek a new story through meditation.One of my meditation teachers was an extraordinary Indian woman named Dipa Ma. She became my role model of someone who endured crushing loss and came through it with enormous love. Her whole path of meditation was propelled by loss \u2014 first, the deaths of two of her children, and then the sudden death of her beloved husband. Dipa Ma was so grief-stricken that she just gave up and went to bed, even though she still had a daughter to raise.One day Dipa Ma\u2019s doctor told her, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die unless you do something about your mental state. You should learn how to meditate.\u201d The story is told that when she first went to practice meditation, Dipa Ma was so weak that she had to crawl up the temple stairs to get inside.Eventually, Dipa Ma emerged from her grief with enormous wisdom and compassion, and in 1972, she became one of my central teachers.One day in 1974, I went to say goodbye to her before leaving India for a brief trip to the United States. I was convinced I\u2019d soon return and spend the rest of my life in India. Dipa Ma took my hand and said, \u201cWell, when you go to America, you\u2019ll be teaching meditation.\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d I replied. \u201cI\u2019m coming right back.\u201d She said, \u201cYes, you will.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t. I can\u2019t do that.\u201d We went on this way, back and forth.Finally, Dipa Ma held my gaze and said two crucial things. First, she said, \u201cYou really understand suffering. That\u2019s why you should teach.\u201d This remark was an essential catalyst that enabled me to reframe my story: The years of upheaval and loss were not just something I had to get over, but a potential source of wisdom and compassion that could be used to help me help others. My suffering might even be some kind of credential! The second thing Dipa Ma said was this: \u201cYou can do anything you want to do. It\u2019s your thinking that you can\u2019t do it that\u2019s stopping you.\u201d What a dif\u00adferent slant on my usual story of incapacity, incompleteness, and not being enough! I carried Dipa Ma\u2019s farewell message with me back to the United States. It set the course for the rest of my life.To say I am grateful for the things I went through in childhood is a bridge too far for me. But I know those experiences are what allow me to connect to people, heart to heart.To truly love ourselves, we must treat our stories with respect but not allow them to have a stranglehold on us, so that we free our mutable present and beckoning future from the past.To truly love ourselves, we must open to our wholeness, rather than clinging to the slivers of ourselves represented by old stories. Living in a story of a limited self \u2014 to any degree \u2014 is not love.To truly love ourselves, we must challenge our beliefs that we need to be different or inherently better to be worthy of love. When we contort ourselves, doggedly trying to find some way to become okay, our capacity to love shrinks, and our attempts to improve ourselves fill the space that could be filled with love.Maybe we don\u2019t need to correct some terrible deficiency. Maybe what we really need is to change our relationship to what is, to see who we are with the strength of a generous spirit and a wise heart. St. Augustine said, \u201cIf you are looking for something that is everywhere, you don\u2019t need travel to get there; you need love.\u201dAn excerpt from the book Real Love: The Art of Mindful Connection by Sharon Salzberg.Written byWritten byAbout this Collection","5334":"Birds understand abundance.It\u2019s a snowy Sunday morning.I shovel before the world around me wakes up.

It\u2019s time.They are anxiously waiting but I still call for them with my horrible whistle that sounds anything but a birdlike song. They don\u2019t seem to mind. I fill the feeders and toss some seeds on the ground \u2014 they sink into the deep snow. Hidden but not wasted.I knew this about birds \u2014 some like to eat high, from the feeder and others like to eat low, off the ground.What an amazing design in efficiency. Nothing will go to waste. The high feeders that drop the seed will be eaten by the low feeders.As I marveled for the first time at this natural synergy, it occurred to me that both birds have a sense of abundance. The feeder birds do not compare themselves with the ground feeding birds nor do the ground feeding birds compare themselves with the feeder birds.Both get what they need.Both serve a purpose.Both are beautiful creatures.Both are worthy.Both are loved.Read my other posts on Medium.Visit Renee.love.Watch my Mindfulness Videos or My Cooking Show.Want to trade?

Tea drinking very likely originated in China and there are various legends surrounding the origins of tea drinking. One legend claims that Shen Nong in 2700 BC set out to find out about the effects of eating various plants, so he tasted over 100 plants in a single day. Luckily he had a transparent stomach so he could directly observe their effects. Tea leaves apparently were able to clear out poisons. Ummm\u2026. yeah. A slightly more believable legend claims that Shen Nong was boiling some water in a pot, when some leaves fell in. After tasting over 100 plants that day, he discovered that tea, while bitter, could make him think quicker and see clearer.Tea drinking went \u2018viral\u2019 and would have broken the internet had the internet only existed in 2700 BC. It spread throughout the world (a little more slowly) by the various ancient trade routes. Because unprocessed tea is quite bitter, the origins of the word come from \u2018tu\u2019 meaning bitter. In the mid 7th century, a pen stroke was removed from the word and the word became \u2018cha\u2019. Virtually all the words for tea in all the different languages of the world are variations are either \u2018tea\u2019 or \u2018cha\u2019. The ancient Chinese Min Nan dialect of the Fujian province used the word \u2018te\u2019 so spread via sea trade translated into the English \u2018tea\u2019 to as far away as the Maori \u2018tii\u2019. The dialects in landlocked regions of China used the word \u2018cha\u2019 and spread via the ancient Silk Road led to the Swahili \u2018chai\u2019 and as far as the Russian \u2018chay\u2019.Interestingly, much of the early writings about tea touted its medicinal effects, particularly on digestion, rather than the (bitter, kind of metallic) taste. Tea is the leaf of the plant Camellia sinensis, and is consumed as green, black and oolong. Most of the purported health benefits have focused on green tea because of the high concentration of polyphenols and the beneficial effects of a chemical compound called catechins, the most abundant of which is epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). According to traditional Chinese beliefs, tea may be beneficial for weight control. This fascinates me, because our current research may only now be catching up with what those ancient Chinese people knew. I\u2019ve long recommended tea drinking in my Intensive Dietary Management program for weight loss.An estimated 2.5 million tons of tea leaves are produced annually, with some 20% becoming green tea. The oldest tree in existence is an estimated 3200 years old (pictured here) and lives in the Yunnan province of China where Pu-er tea is believed to have originated. China\u2019s culture, along with tea drinking spread to Korea and Japan by 200AD.In the 1500s, Portuguese traders brought tea to Europe and by the 1600s it spread to England, who spread their cultural tastes (and their famous stiff upper lip) to much of the rest of the world. The English bought so much tea from China that they developed a huge trade deficit as the Chinese didn\u2019t really want any English stuff, other than their silver.So, the English introduced opium for the express purpose of creating a nation of addicts, which would happily (for the English) balance their trade deficit. The Chinese government were not nearly as happy about their burgeoning opioid crisis and moved to ban the trade. In true gangland, drug-pusher style, the English sent in their big gunships to make sure the opium flowed freely. Thus began the two Opium Wars that eventually won England the ports of Hong Kong, Shanghai and others. As if that were not enough, the English then proceeded to smuggle some trees out of China and set up plantations in India to break China\u2019s 4000 year old monopoly. That\u2019s the kind of ruthlessness that wins you a global empire and probably why the English are the bad guys in the movie \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean\u2019.Different teas come from the same tree species but undergo difference processing. Freshly harvested leaves are immediately steamed, rolled and dried. This inactivates the enzymes responsible for breakdown of color so it becomes the stable green tea leaves you can buy anywhere. This also helps preserve the natural polyphenols in the leaves. If the leaves are fermented, they become Oolong tea, and further fermentation produces black tea. The polyphenols and catechins become changed to theaflavins, which may have their own beneficial effects.Green tea contains much higher concentrations of catechins than black teas, accounting for up to 30% of the dry weight. However, standard brewing methods are insufficient to fully extract them so it may take drinking 10 cups of tea per day to reach the doses of catechins used in studies. Many studies instead use industrially extracted catechin enriched green tea extracts to get the high doses necessary. A more natural, cold brewed green tea is another potential solution to that problem. These catechins are potent anti-oxidants, which may help the body protect against the ravages of inflammatory insults. Anti-oxidants are compounds that protect cells against reactive oxygen species, which may lead to cellular damage. In addition, there may be some protective effect against cancer, Alzheimers and Parkison\u2019s disease, albeit mostly in animal studies.ObesityTwo human studies suggested that catechins in green tea may help with weight loss. The first study gave healthy volunteers a beverage containing green tea catechins, caffeine and calcium 3 times per day and compared the 24 hour energy expenditure.The green tea concoction increased the amount of calories burned by 106 cal\/day or 4.6%. It is not possible to know whether the effect was due to the catechins, caffeine or calcium. Given that calcium has no known effect on metabolic rate, most believe the effect is due to a combination of catechins and caffeine. Luckily for us, green tea naturally contains both catechins and caffeine. In comparison to other studies of caffeine and metabolic rate, however, this green tea drink performed 50\u2013100% better than expected compared to caffeine alone. Heart rate and blood pressure did not differ between the groups, so there was no evidence of excessive sympathetic stimulation by the caffeine that could explain the increased energy expenditure.This echoes the results of an earlier study (Dulloo AG 1999) that found almost identical results, even though this study used half the amount of caffeine, they also showed a similar 4% increase in metabolic rate.In this study, caffeine given alone did not increase energy expenditure. Most studies support the combination of caffeine and catechins, which is found naturally in green tea, although the concentrations of both are much higher in the extracts compared to brewed tea. The 2011 meta-analysis, comparing all studies on green tea, came to similar conclusions that catechin-caffeine mixtures increased energy expenditure by 4.7% and further, found evidence of a dose-response relationship. Only the catechin-caffeine mixtures increased fat oxidation. It was noted during the Cochrane review that no study supported the use of brewed green tea, compared to the small but consistent benefits seen with green tea preparations that contain higher levels of catechins. Naturally enriched green tea was discussed in our last post.Catechins inhibit the enzyme COMT that degrades noradrenalin and cAMP. Blocking COMT increases noradrenalin, explaining the increased energy expenditure. Interestingly, there are genetic differences between COMT activity between races. Asians have higher rates of the high activity COMT(H) allele compared to some Caucasians, which have higher rates of the low-activity COMT(L) allele. Since Asians have the higher activity of COMT, blocking it with green tea catechins would be predicted to show greater effects, explaining the racial difference in the effect of the green tea catechins seen in some studies (1.51 kg versus 0.8 kg weight loss in Asians versus Caucasians).Green tea promote long term weight loss by maintaining basal metabolic rate. Yes, the effect is not huge, but battles are always won on the margin. The difference of 100 calories per day multiplied over years can be very significant. This is reminiscent of the discussion of high blood pressure. We know from many clinical trials that if you lower the blood pressure by a little bit, it has huge benefits when multiplied over millions of people and over decades of time. The same applies to obesity and control of metabolic rate.All of medicine comes down to risk versus reward \u2014 you can\u2019t measure one alone to get a sense of whether or not a treatment is useful. That is, cutting off you arm is a very good treatment for a mosquito bite, but the risk is not worth the reward. So, yes, the rewards are relatively small, but perhaps important over the long term. But the risks are virtually non-existent. Even the most strident critic would be hard pressed to come up with a problem with green tea consumption. Thus the benefit\/risk ratio is very heavily in favor of green tea.So why wound\u2019t you use it? I can\u2019t think of a single reason.Written byWritten by","5416":"Who would have guessed that mental illness plagued Anne Shirley\u2019s creator?Judging by the happy, fairy-world, romanticized published work of L. M. (Maud) Montgomery, readers often assume she lived a happy life. As a long-time fan, I certainly thought so too, until I read all five annotated volumes of her journals.I\u2019ve been an L. M. Montgomery nut since eighth grade, when a friend loaned me her copy of Anne on the cusp of Maud\u2019s work being re-released after most of it being out of print for years. Any time I saw a bookstore, I checked the shelves to see if any more of her books had been republished.Her stories of hope and happiness helped me through junior high and high school. They comforted me in my depression and social anxiety. I had no idea until later that she, too, battled severe depression and an anxiety disorder.Turns out that not only did she have a similar condition, but her depression manifested much like mine: invisible to the outside world, but eating her inside.During Maud\u2019s lifetime, few knew about her inner turmoil. Her greatest confidante, her cousin Frede, died in the Spanish Flu epidemic during World War I. Maud never had another confidante on that level.Frede was the last person Maud truly confided in. From her death onward, no one had any idea what Maud endured, and wouldn\u2019t until her journals were published decades after her death.She put on a happy face. She went in public and did her duties and acted the part expected of her. She played the gracious hostess and gracious guest flawlessly. Afterward, she\u2019d collapse on her bed in miserable fatigue. Or she\u2019d walk the floor all night, unable to sleep. She\u2019d wish for death. She had more than one nervous breakdown.Her husband, Ewen Macdonald, had mental illness too. He certainly had some kind of depression \u2014 religious melancholia, they called it at the time, as he was convinced that he was predestined to go to hell. Some theorize that he had bipolar disorder. I suspect that in addition to depression, he had OCD manifesting as scrupulosity. Whatever it was, science did not yet have the ability to diagnose or treat him.Ewen Macdonald was a minister, which made religious melancholia so much worse \u2014 imagine a preacher believing he was damned before he took her first breath. Ewen retained his position, and got paid, only if his congregation remained happy with his performance. If they\u2019d ever learned that he was mentally and emotionally unstable, well, they would simply have found another minister.That would have spelled disaster for his career. Maud could not take that risk or bear that kind of public humiliation.So Maud, the minister\u2019s wife, covered for him, pretending that all was well. No matter how miserable she felt, Maud went to church and social events, looking happy and strong \u2014 everything she didn\u2019t feel \u2014 while Ewen sat in a corner at home with a handkerchief tied around his head, wailing. During bad spells, he made public appearances only for his Sunday sermons. Maud took care of the rest, protecting the family\u2019s reputation.She couldn\u2019t confide in anyone, or the secret would get out. Her anxiety and depression worsened year by year as she kept up the role.Her work was the one escape she had from a bitter life. In her journal, she once wrote:When I am writing I am happy for I forget all worries and cares.For years at a time, except for those brief respites found during writing, she remained miserable, and no one around her had a clue.Ewen\u2019s episodes grew longer, deeper, and more frequent. He eventually spent time in a mental hospital. She made up excuses for his absence. Eventually, when he could no longer function, his career was over.Maud had become world famous, and for a spell, she easily supported the household. Then the Great Depression hit. When people can hardly buy food, they don\u2019t buy books. Despite her fame, her income plummeted. She struggled to make ends meet. She had heartbreak after heartbreak over her son Chester\u2019s embarrassing behavior \u2014 flunking out of the university, having an extramarital affair \u2014 and Ewen continued to worsen.She had to keep going, so she did. I\u2019m sure she would have preferred to sit in a corner and wail like Ewen. That wasn\u2019t an option. Someone had to keep paying the bills, being a parent, and tending to her career to enable the first two. Otherwise, the fabric of their family would unravel.In 1942, she reached her limit. One last time, she broke down. She died in April, possibly after a medication overdose. Whether it was deliberate or not, we\u2019ll never know conclusively, but the note found on her nightstand says volumes about her misery:I have lost my mind by spells and I do not dare think what I may do in those spells. May God forgive me and I hope everyone else will forgive me even if they cannot understand. My position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it. What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best.The juxtaposition between such utter misery and despair in someone outwardly functional and apparently happy (and famous!) is stark. Note the most telling sentence, with added emphasis:My position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it.Depression doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the sufferer is in bed all day. It doesn\u2019t have to mean they sit on a couch for weeks, watching television but unable to do dishes.Depression can mean those things. I know people for whom that is their depression. That image tends to be the one most people envision when they hear about depression. It never occurs to them that the woman in the coffee shop \u2014 the one put together, looking and behaving professionally, talking animatedly \u2014 could be suicidal.This kind of depression is often referred to as functional depression, and it\u2019s my experience. Some people consider it to be \u201clow-grade\u201d depression, but I can tell you with no uncertainty that it can be every bit as brutal and devastating as other kinds. (Low-grade nothing; don\u2019t get me started.)I\u2019ve battled depression most of my life. I still get out of bed in the morning. Not because I\u2019m not depressed, but because I have had to; my children have counted on it. (Three of the four are in college, so it\u2019s easier a bit now, but the youngest still needs me.) I shower and dress and go in public. I act as if all is well. Because I have to.It\u2019s not always an act, but I\u2019d bet that many times when I\u2019ve been in a very black place, most people have been sure I was fine.Wearing mascara doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not depressed. Feeding kids or getting them to school on time (okay, most mornings), and making sure they have clean clothes didn\u2019t\/doesn\u2019t mean I was\/am free of depression. I\u2019ve spent about two decades going to recitals, soccer games, school plays, concerts, and more with a smile. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have depression or social anxiety. (I have both.)I\u2019ve kept moving because I had to. Sometimes I\u2019ve resented that fact, but even so, I drag one leaden foot in front of the other through the darkness even when I feel sure that the light will never come again.Of course, the darkness always ends, but that\u2019s hard to remember when the black dog hangs on your back, its claws embedded in your skin as it growls ugly things in your ear.During those times, I keep moving, but like a robot, trying not to think, or I\u2019ll drown in despair. The rest of the world sees a functional, healthy person.Another significant difference in functional depression: When I\u2019m in the throes, I don\u2019t feel bad or sinful.Instead, I feel that even if I were to be perfect in every way, it wouldn\u2019t be enough. That I\u2019m irrelevant. That I could vanish from the face of the earth, and no one would notice.Depression keeps me working and doing, no matter what, because in some twisted way, it lies to me, saying that doing and accomplishing is the only way I\u2019ll ever be relevant.So I run and run, advancing mere inches, falling behind by yards. I don\u2019t stop. I can\u2019t stop. No matter how hard and fast and long I run, it\u2019s never enough.The last part of Maud\u2019s note jumps off the page to me because it describes the run, run, run, but never get anywhere feeling that has been a defining part of my life:What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best.Those words make me ache. I feel the same way.I\u2019m not always in that dark place. I can honestly say that I have many happy periods. But the black dog attacks, and that\u2019s when I go back to dragging my feet, then moving faster and faster until I\u2019m frantically running on a hamster wheel, going nowhere.I may look fine. A good chunk of the time, I am fine. Just not always. Most people, not even friends, can tell when I\u2019m putting on a Stepford act to keep from shattering into a billion pieces.That what makes functional depression so hard: you can\u2019t see it. Even those looking for it may miss it, because the sufferer is good at hiding it.I once heard Person A get snarky about how Person B felt down. Person A scoffed, thinking Person B had a perfect life. In that case, as in so many others, I happened to know that the reality was reversed: Person A had a life many people would dream of, yet Person A couldn\u2019t see it, and instead mocked Person B\u2019s trial. I have a suspicion that Person A has depression too. Maybe they\u2019re both doing their best to cling to life at all.So let\u2019s be kind. Let\u2019s have compassion. Let\u2019s give one another the benefit of the doubt. Let\u2019s get rid of the bitter envy that poisons, that lies and has us judging and categorizing one another.You never know who is fighting a battle, who is wounded. Let\u2019s assume everyone is dealing with a heavy burden, whether it\u2019s the black dog or something else.Even when they look \u201cfine.\u201d Sometimes, especially then.Because more often than not, you\u2019ll be right.Written byWritten by","5423":"In order to heal, you have to get to the root cause.When I became a nutrition student in 1992, I had a lot of healing to do. I had the irritable bowel from hell. No treatment had worked, be it conventional medicine or the truly woo woo stuff.It was a good job I was drawn to nutrition as a career subject, because it turned out to be my salvation.What I discovered, as a student, was that I had something called a leaky gut. Cue much hilarity at that. But when given its scientific nomenclature \u2014 intestinal permeability \u2014 the condition suddenly assumes the gravitas it demands.That was the first step. Then I learned how to heal my leaky gut, and therefore my irritable bowel. Twenty-five years on, I remain symptom-free.For nigh-on 15 years I had lived with daily, often excruciating abdominal pain, accompanied by some extraordinary bloating and gas.I could have lived with all that. But a sensitive young adult, I could have done without the spots.Not, thankfully, on my face. But my chest and back were peppered. I was hugely self-conscious, so only wore clothes that covered up those areas. Summers could be tricky.In my early, pre-student days, I lurched from one bad lead to another in my quest to resolve all these issues. I saw a succession of doctors and therapists who turned out to be as clueless as I was.I saw a private skin specialist and had a swanky consultation in a swanky consultation room, all high ceilings and heavy oak furniture. I came away with the same antibiotics that any National Health Service doctor would have given me.They only made things worse. Later, on my course, I would find out why.Then there was the homeopath (zero effect), the spiritual \u2018healer\u2019 (let\u2019s not even go there) and the Chinese herbalist. The latter, I was convinced, was my man. Here was a sage from the East, practising esoteric knowledge seeped in ancient wisdom, no?No.I brewed up the foulest-tasting concoctions, believing the pain would be worth the gain.There was no gain. And the pain continued.At the time, I was a nutrition philistine, and had no idea that all my problems were connected.What truly shocks me, even now, is that nor did any of the specialists I consulted.I came to realise that all my symptoms began and ended in my gut.I acquired two essential wisdoms during my three-year course.First \u2014 when the medics can\u2019t find anything wrong with you, there\u2019s a good chance that it\u2019s your diet that\u2019s the problem.Second \u2014 if something is wrong, you have to get to the cause.So, for the first step on my self-directed healing journey, I invested in two cause-seeking strategies: a stool analysis and a urine test.The stool analysis revealed that I had a severe case of dysbiosis \u2014 an imbalance between good and bad bacteria in the gut. The bad guys (actually, they were downright evil) were in control, rampaging through their dark kingdom like some crazed, middle-earth despot.The good guys were hiding out in some distant intestinal backwater, too few and feeble to do their job, which was to guard my health.Next came the urine test, the aim of which was to check for intestinal permeability, or leaky gut.Intestinal permeability arises when the gut lining becomes damaged, and as a consequence, leaky.The gut lining has two main jobs: to allow the passage of digested nutrients and fluids to cross into the blood, and to stop unwanted intruders from doing the same.This barrier consists of just one layer of cells. Holding these cells together are links, called \u2018tight junctions\u2019.When working properly these tight junctions are like nightclub bouncers, sifting out and blocking the riff raff.But if they become damaged, they lose their tightness and microscopic holes appear. Toxins, bacteria, undigested food, tiny bits of things that fell on your food\u2026 in they pile.One of the consequences of this breach is inflammation.An almighty battle commences. It starts in the gut, but with access all areas the fallout of this mayhem can show up anywhere. So too can symptoms: joint pain, headache, depression, recurrent infections \u2026The liver normally copes well with the body\u2019s everyday toxins, but when the toxic overload exceeds capacity, they get dumped elsewhere. In my case it was skin.Sure enough, the urine test confirmed that I was a walking wikileaks.Generally, the most likely culprits include:Certain medications, especially the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, such as aspirin. Around two thirds of NSAID users have a leaky gut.I had a history of taking NSAIDs.Dysbiosis. See above. Taking antibiotics exacerbates the situation, wiping out the good with the bad bacteria. Dysbiosis is the outcome.Well I knew I had that.Stress and anxiety. Stress creates damaging chemicals called free radicals.Smoking. Smoking is free radical hell.I smoked like a trooper in my late teens and 20s.Diet. Most especially: alcohol, sugar and refined vegetable cooking oils. Soy, corn and sunflower oil are high in pro-inflammatory fatty acids. When heated to high temperatures, they also produce free radicals.All of the above.Allergens. Foods to which you are allergic or intolerant can create irritation and inflammation.With the state of my intestines laid out in black and white, I could have plunged into despair.Au contraire! I couldn\u2019t have been happier. I knew exactly what to do about it.First, I started taking probiotics \u2014 friendly bacteria to fight the unfriendly. Probiotics also strengthen tight junctions and produce anti-inflammatory chemicals.Next, I really tidied up my diet.Out went every refined carbohydrate and vaguely sugary item. In came as many vegetables as I could manage, especially the brightly coloured variety, including peppers, tomatoes, red onions and aubergines.These vegetables are loaded with antioxidants that fight free radicals, and plant chemicals that fight inflammation. So too are dark leafy greens, such as broccoli and spinach.In came live natural yogurt and lots of oily fish. This category includes salmon, herring, trout, anchovies, sardines and mackerel. I also took fish oil supplements, for good measure. Fish oil is highly anti-inflammatory, so combined with the probiotics formed a significant part of my arsenal. And fish is a complete protein, essential for any kind of healing.Out went anything that contained pro-inflammatory, refined vegetable oils.A self-imposed ban on alcohol was put in place. A well-known contributor to leaky gut syndrome, I stayed clear (most of the time).It took several months to complete the healing process. But it was complete: all my symptoms vanished. Calm was restored, and it was wonderful. It still is.I went on to practise as a nutrition consultant for over 15 years, and saw many cases of leaky gut in that time. I found it took most people at least two months to heal.And like me, they had acquired that one essential core wisdom: whatever your symptoms, your journey must begin with finding the cause.My healthy digestion and clear skin are the evidence of that \u2014 25 years on.Written byWritten by","5438":"We\u2019ve all heard the popular 17th century English phrase: \u201cThe early bird catches the worm.\u201d But this is not necessarily true for everyone, especially in today\u2019s 24\/7 high-tech mobile, digital and virtual Information Age.Therefore, ask yourself whether you\u2019re a so-called \u201cEarly Bird\u201d or a \u201cNight Owl\u201d? The answer to this seemingly innocuous question says a lot about how you approach the start of Daylight Saving Time (DST), which began today in the USA.If you\u2019re a proverbial night owl, like me, more daylight in the evening hours is beneficial. In fact, there are many practical reasons why more daylight makes good business sense in terms of increasing productivity and benefiting the overall health and well-being of employees.In addition to the USA, about 70 countries are impacted by DST, according to TimeAndDate.com.However, many sleep experts warn that changing the clocks, in general, can result in sleep deprivation by throwing off our internal body clocks and disrupting our circadian rhythms. This can be true whether we \u201cspring forward\u201d or \u201cfall back.\u201dThe start of DST is bad news for early risers, like my better half, Nicole. She\u2019s a high school teacher who wakes up for work at 5:30 a.m. That\u2019s why she\u2019s not thrilled about changing the clocks. This means Nicole now must wake up and commute to work in the dark, which she says can feel like the middle of the night. This perspective makes sense for a morning person.Therein stems the dilemma between early birds versus night owls, as we now enjoy more daylight in the evening: who benefits and who suffers? And what makes that mere hour of extra sunlight at night such a valuable commodity to those of us who are nocturnal by nature?The positive factors of DST, include (but are not limited to) the following:In fact, the end of DST reportedly costs the USA alone nearly half a billion dollars annually in productivity losses, according to the Lost-Hour Economic Index available on SleepBetter.org. The index breaks down the total dollar loss in economic activity due to changing the clocks for the top 360 metropolitan areas in the USA.We all consume vast amounts of energy in today\u2019s fast evolving digital age where the use of solar power is trending upward. Thus, in an effort to enhance energy efficiency and business cost savings, countless numbers of companies worldwide have \u201cgone green\u201d with the growing popularity of solar energy.Gaining that extra hour of daylight at night means less money spent by employers and consumers alike.To the contrary, many companies and individuals may not care much about energy efficiency and the so-called Green Revolution. However, according to the website TimeAndDate:Another consequential benefit of gaining an hour of sunlight in the evening is more productivity and better results for some employees. Another upside for business is more revenue for some industries, particularly tourism and hospitality.I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve observed over the years that more employees tend to go home earlier once it becomes dark outside. Similarly, most tourists tend to curtail their outdoor activities. Yet with more sunlight at night, just the opposite occurs.This is because our subconscious minds may equate darkness with sleep.TimeAndDate also states:It\u2019s certainly no secret that darkness impairs the vision of drivers, which leads to more vehicular accidents.More folks fall asleep at the wheel, have collisions with other vehicles or objects, and hit innocent pedestrians trying to cross the street or bike home from work, for example.The medical community \u2014 particularly cardiology, psychiatry and psychology \u2014 are well aware that less daylight leads to an increased risk of heart attacks, in addition to higher rates of depression and suicide.For instance, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) negatively impacts the health and wellness of millions of people across the globe. Of course, this is remedied to some extent by medication, therapy and the use of light boxes to provide more artificial light.Still, SAD remains problematic as a health concern. To the contrary, more sunlight results in better mental and physical health.According to UK-based media outlet The Week: \u201cLighter evenings have a positive benefit for public health, say researchers. One study of 23,000 children, published on the BBC, found that their daily activity levels were 15 to 20 percent higher on summer days than winter days, and that moving the clocks back causes a five percent drop in physical activity.\u201dAll the factors noted above represent some significant considerations as the evening looms later. But what\u2019s most important to YOU?In essence, whether you\u2019re a night owl or an early bird, everyone appears to give a hoot or chirp about DST.Lastly, many people find peace, tranquility and inspiration in nature. This means, for night owls like me, watching the sunset when possible. It\u2019s a lot easier to observe a sensational sunset later in the evening compared to earlier. This is primarily due to traditional work schedules and longer commuting times which cause people to arrive home from work later.Thus, when I have the opportunity to watch a beautiful sunset it helps spark my creative thought process, serving as a catalyst for new ideas, inspiration and motivation. These are beneficial factors for some writers, artists and other creative types.What about you?But regardless of whether you rise at the crack of dawn with roosters, or howl at the moon with wolves, remember the clock is always ticking.Written byWritten by","5552":"Surviving, Not ThrivingIn the midst of a crisis, no one worries about proper nutrition:You\u2019re just trying to survive.

I studied and trained like my life depended on it.I consulted with some of the world\u2019s best oncologists and naturopaths, as my husband and I did everything we could to strengthen his immune system and heal his body from terminal cancer.I\u2019ve read countless books on optimizing health and fighting cancer\u2026Dr. Kelly Turner\u2019s groundbreaking book, \u201cRadical Remission\u201d, Dr. Servan-Shreiber\u2019s pioneering work, \u201cAnticancer: A New Way of Life\u201d, Dr. Thomas Seyfried\u2019s seminal text \u201cCancer as a Metabolic Disease\u201d, and Dr. Nasha Winter\u2019s recent bestseller \u201cThe Metabolic Approach to Cancer\u201d to name just a few.I travelled to the Omega Institute for Dr. Turner\u2019s and Dr. Winters\u2019 workshops, so I could learn everything they could teach me about nutrition, gut health, purification, positivity and mind\/body balance.I know all about the damaging effects of sugar addiction, toxic GMO foods, BPA in plastics, and hazardous chemicals in beauty and cleaning products.I spent the last several months of my husband\u2019s life guiding him through a strict ketogenic diet. I measured every bite of food, charted everything he ate and drank.When he experienced a setback, I sat down and researched some more. Surely there must be more we could do, one more trial, one more experimental possibility we hadn\u2019t yet explored.I Have To Be ThereWe did all we could and we were blessed with three and a half years together.Then, when my husband died and the long battle with cancer was over, I drove the boys down to Florida to spend time with my family.I rocked Lucas to sleep and sang lullabies to James. And when the boys were finally asleep, I had a quiet moment to myself. I crashed onto the couch with a tall glass of cabernet in one hand and a box of Girl Scout Samoa cookies in the other. Both were empty when I finally mustered up the energy to peel myself off the sofa and crawl into bed.Over the next few weeks, I went out for pizza with my girlfriends and ate half a pie. I devoured cheeseburgers and fries like they were in limited supply. I binged on donuts and pasta. I ate like I hadn\u2019t eaten in months.I knew this wasn\u2019t healthy. I just didn\u2019t have the desire or strength to change it.Weeks went by. I was nursing the baby, who was barely sleeping through the night, and I was trying to be there for James, my five year old son.James was missing his daddy, asking me all kinds of questions.As I tried to comfort him, he didn\u2019t realize how much he was helping me get through these dark days. My love for him forced me to find an inner strength I never knew I had.I have to get up every morning, to be there for James and let him know he still has one parent.He still has his Mommy.I have to eat and drink every day, whether I feel like like it or not because seven-month-old Lucas is still nursing.And I realized: I don\u2019t have to be perfect, but I do have to be there,regardless of the turmoil inside.I have to breathe. I have to look James in the eye and smile. I have to.Eventually, I pulled myself together, a little bit.I still cry every day, but I\u2019m starting to look ahead, to think of a future.Not the future I wanted, but \u2014 I still have things to do. I can still help others.Maybe not right now, but soon.A Plan To Be BetterMy older son, James, came up to me one day.\u201cMommy, am I going to get cancer? Mommy, are you going to get cancer?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, honey. I hope not.\u201d\u201cMommy, I don\u2019t want to get cancer. I don\u2019t want you to get cancer like Daddy.\u201dGuilt flooded my heart as I pulled James onto my lap. I haven\u2019t been taking care of myself and James needs me to do better.He just lost his daddy, and he\u2019s worried about dying himself. He\u2019s terrified of losing me too.It hit me. The least I could do was offer him a plan.Getting James involved in heathy eating would give him a sense of control, some assurance that we were doing all we could to avoid getting cancer.At five years old, James was old enough to remember when his daddy was in remission and ran Spartan races, when his daddy was strong and healthy, chasing James around the park and tossing him in the air. James remembered when daddy spent hours playing with him.This last year had been hard on all of us. James loved his daddy so much and I don\u2019t want him to forget the good times. He also needs to know that we will find a way to be happy again.\u201cJames, I have an idea. Let\u2019s make a plan.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of plan?\u201d\u201cA plan to stay healthy.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean I won\u2019t get cancer?\u201d\u201cThat means your body will be very strong. Strong bodies are better at fighting cancer.\u201d\u201cYeah. I\u2019m super strong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my boy.\u201d\u201cMommy? Are you super strong?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to be. I have to be, to keep up with you, right?\u201cYeah.\u201dThere lies my future. Like any mom, I have to be there, for them. I coach others to have stronger, healthier bodies. But my coach? He\u2019s in kindergarten.A Call To ActionPlease clap and share this story if you enjoyed it and feel it might help someone else. Have you ever struggled to prioritize your health?

This approach is not revolutionary, or special, but a lot of the time doing the basics well and consistently in the health and wellness realm is far more powerful than the latest and greatest.On top of this, I refuse to make any stereotypical bull**** claims other companies in this space monopolise off, you all know the ones. Every person is unique, and such so should our approach to eating be. I am convinced this approach will not be for everyone (shout out to my mum). Though, the reason I love this approach aside from the fact it works for me is that it harnesses enhancement in awesome primal physiological functions, and corrects some of the habits our western lifestyle has ingrained in us. Enter the dorky side oozing out.So to the meat and potatoes.Here\u2019s how it works. It is a three phase approach which slightly evolves throughout the day. I have found it most effective following this 4\u20135 days a week. Any more and I lost too much weight. It is also important to break routines and schedule in lapses. Your body and mind will love you for it. You\u2019ll also notice many exceptions to the rule and tweaks throughout. We are not elite athletes where an extra 3\u20135% makes all the difference, and as such we can give ourselves a little leeway. The bigger picture is still bright. Also, for some context I am a 25 year old healthy male, who is super active and often eats out. This approach can be applied and adapted as necessitates.Phase 1Firstly, it begins with a period of fasting, I know what you are all thinking \u201cI don\u2019t want to starve myself, especially because breakfast is the most important meal of the day\u201d \u2014 not entirely correct. And no you will not be hungry for long, your body is a marvellous creation, it adapts very quickly. For decades we have been conditioned to embrace the importance of a meal first thing in the morning. Let me explain why this contradicts our natural inclinations. Anomaly events aside (big night out, burning the candle at both ends for work, sickness and compromised health etc.) our body is generally very good at knowing when it\u2019s time to wake up. This is due to a concept called the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). Without going into irrelevant boring details, cortisol levels rise by about 50% around the time of waking and just after. The cool thing about cortisol is that when left alone it is very effective at burning fat. Want to ramp this up even more? Try a fasted exercise session in the AM. The issue arises when insulin gets thrown into the mix. Insulin levels rise in the presence of carbohydrates\u2014 which essentially get broken down into simple sugar in your blood- your morning cereal, toast, porridge etc. causing the perfect storm. A hormone called lipoprotein lipase, which for this purpose all you need to know is a fat storer in your body, gets ramped up, whilst hormone sensitive lipase, the king fat releasing enzyme in your body is suppressed \u2014 which is no bueno. Apologies for the endocrine rant, it was relevant enough to warrant.So what does this all mean? Essentially, you have just blunted your bodies attempts at burning stored fat, and instead fed it with largely unnecessary short lived fuel. The result \u2014 the all too familiar mid to late morning crash, and the inevitable craving for more food. This occurs due to the vicious spike and crash of insulin levels in the blood. Related feelings and emotions as a bi product include fatigue, irritability, lack of concentration and fogginess to name a few. Over time you can add fat accumulation to this list. Relatable?The fix is to simply skip breakfast and alternatively maybe drink some water with a squeeze of lemon. If like me you need your morning coffee that\u2019s still fine, try to keep it on the black side and with minimal sugar. For some one who simply just cannot go without eating in the morning, or the athletic type, opt for a meal made up of protein and fats. Think eggs (cooked in butter or olive oil), salmon, bacon, avocado, nuts. A trick I have picked up in this period and which can be used throughout the day is mixing a scoop or two of amino acids in your water. Do some quick research (read some broscience reviews), and get yourself one with no sugar and pesky additives. Most taste great, so sip away. I have found the sweetness tricks the brain keeping it happy and satisfied, and the taste leads to more fluid consumption throughout the day. (tick tick). The efficacy of the actual supplement is not my contention to discuss, yes the theory is drinking amino acids will help prevent catabolism (muscle breakdown), but we are not stranded on a desert island. Our next meal is only a few hours away.Another benefit of this fasting period is the rest and regeneration it allows your digestive system to facilitate. Food as a whole requires large amounts of effort to process, leading to GI strain. This is made exponentially worse when there are a high concentrations of starch to digest, an inflammatory marker by nature. Leading to bloating, irritability and an overall unsettled stomach. Do this every day and your overall GI health suffers immensely. Which isn\u2019t ideal for anyone.A general guide is the 16\u20138, whereby you fast for 16 hours and eat for 8. I find this is a nice starting point. But once again depending on the day and what lies ahead this fast may be marginally longer or shorter.Starting your day like this leads us neatly into the next phase of the approach.Phase 2.By now it\u2019s probably 12\u20131pm, you either haven\u2019t eaten yet or are a coffee deep. I can atest that although peckish and ready for a meal you are by no means famished or hangry at this point. Another interesting thing I notice is how my mornings go quicker whist fasting. The reason I love this approach is because it\u2019s layered and logical, now it is time to piggy back on the sometimes controversial and what I believe to be misunderstood phenomenon of ketosis. Before I continue, this approach as a whole will not put you into full blown ketosis. Though it reaps some of the benefits.Simply put, ketosis is the bodies process of uptaking and utilising ketones (fats) in the absence of the other readily available fuel source in glucose, originating from carbohydrates. For this to occur you 1. cannot have a carbohydrate dense meal(s) throughout the morning, and 2. should ensure you eat a high content of protein and fats, yes fats! Who would\u2019ve thought they are not the devil.. that\u2019s a topic for another piece. I have also found that this period helps to maintain mental clarity and focus, combined with a settled stomach it leads to a greater sense of well being and happiness.Anything from a hearty salad with lots of good fats (avocado, olive oil, nuts) to satay chicken using organic peanut butter with a big side of green veg are great options to start the day of eating. As you move throughout the afternoon if you get the itch to top up your caffeine stores try adding some full fat whipped cream to your coffee, I know what you are thinking, it won\u2019t make you fat. Just try it. The cream will keep you full and energised between meals.Wiggle room.Here\u2019s where you can make adjustments to fit your lifestyle and personal preferences. Whilst ideal to avoid carbohydrates until the evening period, if you have strenuous exercise planned for your afternoon or sports training as I routinely do you can give your body a little extra fuel, which will in turn go a long way.My go to choice is a banana, at around 20\u201330 grams of carbs, it\u2019s perfect for tiding you over whilst ensuring that mental acuity and \u2018lightness\u2019 associated with ketosis is maintained. A dash of organic peanut butter on the banana is also the goods. On the topic of fruit, feel free to eat away. There are far greater evils than a bit of extra natural fructose in your diet \u2014 looking at you sugar cravings.Am I robbing Peter to pay Paul?A notion many people against ketogenic eating put forth is the idea that obviously you will lose weight because you are depriving yourself, limiting almost all carbs \u2014 cue the \u201cno wonder you\u2019re losing weight\u201d comment. In one sense they are right, the absence of carbohydrates does assist with lipolysis (fat breakdown and usage), however what they fail to understand is that the body being the amazing specimen it is adapts quite rapidly to changes, reflected in its ability to switch its usage of energy pathways.An interesting side with the ketogenic diet, is it use in the 1900\u2019s for the treatment of pre-diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Before exogenous (external to the body) insulin was adopted as a primary treatment protocol more recently, health care professionals utilised the associated benefits of ketosis to manage and reverse the effects of T2DM. As well as greater stability of insulin levels in the blood, the enhanced sensitivity of it to be able to bind to glucose (like a lock and key) is essential for weight management. In extension to this point, current government recommendations suggest that over 30% of your fuel should come from grain, when taking into account some fruits and vegetables aswell as dairy also contain carbohydrates (complex and simple sugars) the daily intake easily moves towards 50% of your total daily consumption. It\u2019s outdated and ineptly inaccurate information like this which is contributing to and fostering our current health status.Taking all of this into account, I still believe it to be short sighted and unsustainable to completely eliminate any macro nutrient. At the end of the day, who wants to say no to a woodfire pizza or home made gnocchi?Hello phase 3.Phase 3.This phase begins either after your post work session, or at around 6pm for the rest of you. Following a session I can confirm your body will be more than ready for some carbs, satisfy the desire with something white (yes, white carbs!). The speed with which your body will process them is ideal for replenishing glycogen stores, and lets face it who doesn\u2019t love potatoes\/rice\/pasta\/noodles?If you are not the active type rotate these white starches with things like sweet potato, wild rice and dark\/grainy bread.Like with any intervention to optimise health, some discipline must be employed. Instead of 80+% of your meal being rich in starch, add some salads and veg in, with a generous portion of protein. And please don\u2019t eat plain steamed veg, it is boring and you don\u2019t deserve that after a long day of work. Cook with butter and olive oil and season generously. The extra fats at night are essential for hormone production and re regulation while you sleep. The beauty of this approach is although you may be hungry and ready for a satisfying dinner, the consumption of fats throughout the afternoon will curb that all too familiar hangry feeling. This is because when we expose our body to starchy carbs at every meal (and sometimes even more regularly with snacks too), we put ourselves on what I like to describe as a carb cycle, once our insulin spikes and we get the dump we need more carbs. Similar to groundhog day this series of events repeats itself over and over.So? Well our bodies being the uber efficient beings they are realise this is sufficient to survive on. Keeping the rest of the carbs we ingest aswell as the pre-existing fat mass for a \u2018rainy day\u2019, which in modern society will never come.The danger zone.7pm till bedtime. You are not the only one who struggles with this period. The urge is to satisfy sweet and savoury cravings, by any means necessary. In short, if you have your heart set on a scoop or two of your favourite ice cream do it. In the greater scheme of things, it\u2019s not going to ruin your day. Like with much of this approach use some common sense, two or three desserts in a week wont undo the rest of the time your body is benefiting from the positives of this approach. Like me if your speed is set to hectic during the day you probably wont get a chance to eat two substantial meals. This is where I suggest substituting the dessert for dinner 2. Some leftovers from earlier on. If this is the case please do not forget to snack throughout the day, unsalted nuts are ace for this.And no, carbs before bed are not bad. This is because you have reduced the feeding window for your body to uptake and utilise these carbs, in turn also decreasing the volume which has been ingested. This fuel will be well received and put to good use whilst your sleeping. Think of your body as a machine, continually regenerating and progressing. A nice flow on effect is the mood state you\u2019ll experience post this period. It is likely you\u2019ll feel relaxed and tired, throw in a hot shower, chamomile tea and a podcast and your well on your way to 8+hours of restful sleep.Grain of salt.There are many means to an end. This approach ticks off many of my day to day needs, and I have found it allows me to feel great and perform optimally in physical competition on a weekly basis. I also love the fact that it is not based on a \u2018fad\u2019 diet and has real world, every day sustainability. That being said, it will not be for everyone. And if it was I would be concerned about it\u2019s efficacy. If I could impart one takeaway message it would be to find what works for you. Not just your physical being, but also (and I would argue more importantly) your mental and emotional needs. We are such complex and wonderful creatures it is narrow minded to think that one size fits all in any aspect. Life is meant to be enjoyed, please don\u2019t spend it counting calories and drinking meal replacement shakes. You don\u2019t deserve that.Oh and one more thing, what kind of EP would I be if I didn\u2019t spruik exercise? Get moving in any way you like. Your body and mind will thank you for it.Written byWritten by","5746":"When did food become the biggest health challenge of our lives? How did we get to a place where the very thing that has the power to heal all ailments and disease is now the thing that is causing it?In the United States, we have access to more food than ever before in history. We have superfoods imported from Asia. We have tropical foods imported from South America and other far away islands. We have seasonal foods all year round thanks to indoor greenhouses.Yet food allergies and sensitivities are on the rise. According to Dr. Jonathan Hemler, pediatric allergy and immunology specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, as reported by NBC news,\u201cWe have noticed that the prevalence of food allergy has tripled in the last 20 to 30 years.\u201dThat is a frightening number and even more frightening because doctors are saying they don\u2019t know why. NBC goes on to report,Theories explaining the increase in adult food allergies range from vitamin D deficiency to alterations in gut bacteria due to the combination of a more clean environment and Western diet. Researchers also say that eating too much processed food might also increase one\u2019s risk to develop food allergies.It\u2019s not just food allergies that are increasing either. Auto immune diseases, cancers, depression, and autism are on the rise as well. Many of these diseases are being linked to the foods we eat. A recent study at Yale was conducted to see if refined salt had an effect on auto immune disease. They found that mice fed a diet high in refined salt had higher levels of inflammation and were more likely to develop a severe form of a disease associated with multiple sclerosis in humans. Professor David Hafler from Yale University says,Today, Western diets all have high salt content and that has led to an increase in hypertension and perhaps autoimmune disease as well.Most of us now know that all the processed and packaged foods that are so prevalent in American culture are not part of a healthy diet. Many people are becoming more health conscious of the food they eat and are taking steps to clean up their diets.I have spent years researching, learning, and experimenting with improving my eating habits and looking for the optimal diet for my best health. I am the person who brings her own lunch to work and buys 90% of her food at the local farmer\u2019s market which includes organic, grass fed beef, pastured chicken, and wild caught local fish.I believe a healthy diet is ever evolving. Doctors and scientists are constantly uncovering new information about the human body and nutrition. Not only that, but our bodies are constantly changing with our age, our environment, and our stress levels, both physically and emotionally. This means that just because certain foods are working for you right now, does not mean they will work for you in a year, or even a month.I have written about the mind body connection and how our bodies have an amazing ability to signal us when things are wrong or in need of repair. This connection is deepened when we feed our bodies whole, unprocessed foods.This can be challenging in our distracted, on the go style of living. We are primed to ignore signs and signals our bodies are sending. We don\u2019t have time to slow down enough to recognize the subtle cues we might be receiving on a daily basis. We lose touch with the intricacies of the mind body connection. The processed, packaged, convenient foods we are accustomed to grabbing are dulling these signals and even creating false signals and cravings for things like sugar, salt and fats.It takes work and diligence to avoid the processed foods and instead choose whole, organic foods that grow from the earth or hang from a tree. But once you begin feeding your body clean, whole food it becomes easier to continue. The taste buds sharpen and soon the processed, over sweetened and salted foods lose their appeal. The body gets no satisfaction from them. The temptation dulls and you begin to crave high quality colorful fruits and vegetables.This has been my experience for the many years I have been working on optimizing my diet. Slowly, I began to eliminate refined sugars and carbs. I focus on nutrient dense, fresh, seasonal and local foods. I choose organic whenever possible and avoid anything in a package. I even make my own energy bars to fuel my workouts. I began to reap the rewards of my efforts. My energy increased and my athletic performance improved.But a few years ago I began to develop some skin problems. I noticed redness in my face and some acne that I had never experienced before. The doctor diagnosed it as rosacea. She prescribed antibiotics. I try to avoid taking antibiotics unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary so I have spent years seeking out natural alternative treatments with little sustainable success.In addition to the rosacea, I also developed some chronic ankle and shin pain. It was manageable pain that I would wake up with each morning. Some nights the pain would disturb my sleep and wake me up but generally it would disappear upon rising. At one point it worsened enough that it affected my running and training so I saw a physical therapist. After about 2 months of PT, it went away. I was back to running and I was armed with a set of exercises that kept the pain at bay. Then in about 6 months, the pain slowly surfaced again. It was gradual. I would ramp up the frequency of my exercises but eventually they stopped working all together. The pain was there each morning again.The most disturbing of my symptoms was brain disfunction. I began to notice memory problems. I was forgetting names often, and movies and tv shows I watched would disappear from my mind just hours after seeing them. I would lose words and my train of thought mid conversation without recovery. I would experience brain fog that felt like my brain was shutting down and not not fully returning when it came back online.When I complained to friends, most of them commiserated that it happens to them too and doesn\u2019t it suck to get older.Yet, I had the nagging feeling that this can\u2019t be normal.Because I believe that our bodies naturally want to heal themselves and that food is a powerful tool to assist in this process, I decided to do an elimination diet. I knew that things like soy, gluten, dairy, and sugar are often root causes to chronic inflammation in the body and can produce a whole host of seemingly unrelated symptoms like the ones I was experiencing. And even though I reduced those things in my diet, I had not eliminated them entirely.In the first five days of the diet, my ankle pain disappeared entirely. Then mysteriously on the 6th day, it came back. I didn\u2019t know what I had introduced that may have caused it to come back, so I began to work with a nutritionist to assist me. After a series of blood, stool and urine testing, we discovered some possible causes of my brain fog and skin issues. I was deficient in some key B Vitamins that are responsible for brain function, memory performance, and skin health. My mitochondria were not getting the fats I was feeding it and they were instead showing up in my urine.The most concerning result of these lab tests was the mercury that showed up in my blood. Very high levels of mercury. The thing about mercury is that it binds to your tissues and organs so seeing it in a blood panel only reveals a recent exposure. It doesn\u2019t tell you the full body burden. Interestingly, I had eaten sushi and smoked salmon in the days prior to the blood test. I had also experienced brain fog and memory loss the days I ate the seafood.From here, I went to a functional medicine doctor who administered a DMPS Challenge Test, in which a chelating agent is given through IV that draws the heavy metals out of the body. Then a 6 hour urine test is collected and tested to measure the heavy metals that are released. The results of this test revealed very high levels of mercury and elevated levels of lead and tin as well. (I have since learned there are some questions over the interpretations of these tests and a Mercury Tri Test is more reliable.)So here I am being vigilant about my eating habits, educating myself on the right things to put inside of my body, reducing and eliminating fast food, processed foods and packaged foods, and somehow I am still poisoning myself with toxic heavy metals. It\u2019s important for me to mention though, that likely a big contributor to the mercury in me is the amalgam fillings I had in my mouth. Three were removed prior to the time of testing and the final 4 have since been removed. Amalgam fillings, safe mercury removal and the practices of conventional dentistry are a whole other very important topic but not one that I am going to dive into in this article. For now, I am choosing to keep the focus on food, but I want to make clear that I am not placing sole blame on food for any of my symptoms.According to the article Mercury Toxicity, from Precision Nutrition writer Ryan Andrews, mercury can come not just from seafood but many other food sources. This is due to mercury\u2019s ability to accumulate in the soil foods are grown in.\u201cBurning fossil fuels and mining (mercury is used to extract gold) emit inorganic mercury vapor into the atmosphere. This mercury floats around and eventually settles into waterways, where it\u2019s organified to methylmercury by microorganisms.\u201dThe article reports the following list as sources of mercury coming from food:Mercury isn\u2019t the only toxin we have to watch out for either. There are a number of other heavy metals, pesticides, and fungicides that are getting into the ground soil and contaminating our food sources. And choosing organic doesn\u2019t eliminate exposure to pesticides. Christie Wilcox writes in Scientific American,\u201cnatural pesticides don\u2019t fare any better than synthetic\u2026Many natural pesticides have been found to be potential \u2014 or serious \u2014 health risks, including those used commonly in organic farming.\u201dThere is so much controversy over pesticide use and whether organic food is healthier or worth the extra cost, it\u2019s hard to know what to believe. The sad truth is the food industry is a huge business and it is driven by profit, not what is best for our health. There are lobbyists, food corporations and government agencies who are happy to fund studies that will tell us their practices are not harmful and the levels of toxin exposures in foods are too low to cause any harm.But what they fail to acknowledge is that there is a cumulative effect of all these toxins that we are being bombarded with day in and day out. When you begin to add up all the parts per million doses that are \u201csafe\u201d in any one food product, by the end of the day if you have consumed several of those foods, suddenly you are over the \u201csafe\u201d dosage. Add in the pollutants we are breathing in, toxins that are in our cleaning products as well in our water and skin products, the body is now experiencing a huge overload that is flooding the detox pathways and causing a backup in the system. Our natural ability to detox is now compromised.In the meantime, people continue to get sick. Symptoms of chronic fatigue, joint pain, memory loss, brain fog, anxiety, depression, skin rashes, sinus allergies and more are chalked up to signs of aging or assumed to be the fault of the individual not taking care of herself.But there are a lot of health conscious people, like myself, who are choosing plant based, organic diets, keeping fit, and getting regular sleep, yet are still experiencing some of these chronic symptoms. Most of these people will ignore the signs. Or worse, they will push through the discomfort, quietly chastising themselves for not being more energetic, happy or motivated. This can go on for years, but the danger of allowing these toxins to build up is that eventually they will catch up with us and bring us down.If you have a hidden food sensitivity, food allergy, heavy metal toxins or a build up of pesticides like glyphosate (a.k.a., Roundup), and they are not dealt with now, you could end up developing a whole host of diseases including Parkinson\u2019s, Multiple Sclerosis, cancer, and Alzheimer\u2019s to name a few.I don\u2019t share this information to create panic. Rather, the hope is to create awareness and instill the importance of deepening your own mind body connection. If you are experiencing any chronic conditions, whether pain issues, skin issues, respiratory or even mood swings and fatigue, they could be signs that food is making you sick or that you have a toxic overload. Be kind and honest with yourself and pay attention to small signals.Here\u2019s a few strategies I have found helpful in determining which foods are working for me and which may be a problem:Being healthy shouldn\u2019t be this complicated. Eating shouldn\u2019t be this toxic. But unless you buy your own farm on untouched land and grow your own food, this is the reality of the food industry. The best way to combat the food lobbyists and big corporations is with your wallet.Let\u2019s give our food the power it is supposed to have. The power to heal our bodies from the inside out.Written byWritten by","5806":"Thirty five degrees with sunshine feels pretty good for mid-March in my neck of the woods.

The world beckons: Come play outside!Who am I to ignore spring?I lace my tennis shoes, clip my purple iPod to the backside of my waistband, insert my uncooperative earbuds and wrangle my knit hat over top. Mittens \u2014 check! I turn up the volume of Runmix2 and head out through the garage. Ellie grumbles \u2014 This garage is a mess. We need to sweep the floor and vacuum up the spider webs.True that Ellie! It is a mess, but right now we\u2019ve got exercise to do. Later, OK? Let\u2019s run!Ellie can be a reluctant exercise partner. She loves to procrastinate.Our driveway is exactly one tenth of a mile long. It has a gentle slope and a fun little S-turn. Five circuits, down to the cul-de-sac and back up again is a mile. One mile a day Ellie \u2014 that\u2019s all I ask. Ten minutes that often blossom into more.With Toby Keith singing about Mexico, Ellie and I head down the drive. As we approach the cul-de-sac, Ellie shouts over Toby:We look stupid! Would you please stop flailing your arms around? The neighbors think we\u2019re weird.Ellie and I have this discussion often \u2014 on the driveway, on neighborhood streets, on woodland trails and at the marsh.I explain to Ellie that waving our arms around in time to the music increases our heart rate. Not only that, it\u2019s fun! and removes the monotony from the workout. I patiently remind Ellie that weird can be OK. What if by rocking it while we run, somebody else is inspired to get up and shake it, too? We could be the lone nut that starts a movement. Win\/win, right?Ellie never admits it at the start, but she knows how motivating it is to add a little bling to our pumping legs.Down and up, down and up, down and up.On our fifth trip up Ellie shouts over Shedaisy:Hey! Do you see that chipmunk on the rock wall? I bet he\u2019s weak from his long hibernation. We can take him!Run faster!!!!!!Writing about Ellie is a little tricky. She\u2019s always in the room \u2014 in fact, she lives in my head. She\u2019s comprised of nearly five decades of experience and often directs me \u2014 her rider \u2014 more than I direct her. Buddha once compared the mind to a wild elephant. He said:In days gone by this mind of mine used to stray wherever selfish desire or lust or pleasure would lead it. Today this mind does not stray and is under the harmony of control, even as a wild elephant is controlled by a trainer.In The Happiness Hypothesis, Jonathan Haidt describes his own elephant\/rider metaphor:In sum, the rider is an advisor or servant; not a king, president or charioteer with a firm grip on the reins. The rider is Gazzaniga\u2019s interpreter module; it is conscious, controlled thought. The elephant, in contrast, is everything else. The elephant includes the gut feelings, visceral reactions, emotions and intuitions that comprise much of the automatic system. The elephant and the rider each have their own intelligence, and when they work together well they enable the unique brilliance of human beings. But they don\u2019t always work together well.Written byWritten by","5853":"Horse oil, what is it? I come across an incalculable number of products, masks and cosmetic treatments based on this ingredient. Inevitably, I am intrigued and we probably all are.\u201cHorse oil\u201d, as in horse oil?We have all come across a lot of beauty products flanked by a vector image representing a horse. I learned that these products are inspired by the BAYU which is a mixture made by the Japanese ancestors to heal the skin in cases of eczema, acne, burning or extreme sensitivity. It contains, among other things, horse oil. The BAYU is also acclaimed in China.So, the answer is yes. This oil comes from a horse!The fat is usually taken from the mane or the abdomen of the horse. This operation is often made once the animals are slaughtered. Then, the fat is treated for cosmetics use.What is the interest of horse oil?It is less \u201cgreasy\u201d than other animal oils and it is very similar to the molecular structure of human tissues. Result? Bayu enthusiasts say that horse oil is much better tolerated and absorbed by their skin.How to use Horse Oil in your routine?Everything depends on the product and its function. Here is a list of products based on Horse Oil that can be found quite easily in Asia:Written byWritten by","5932":"Every year people spend more than $4 trillion to try to alter their states. That is two times the GDP of Russia! Are you one of them? Yes, the mind-altering state economy is huge. That includes the last time you went for a run (dopamine shot aka \u201crunner\u2019s high\u201d that the body releases to reduce pain)\u2026Or the time you did yoga or meditation to disconnect from the daily life\u2026 And of course, let\u2019s not forget the coffee you drunk this morning! Whether it is for pure pleasure, to escape reality or for an immediate change in mood, it is clear this is something everyone does to differing extents.This was the area that I focused on, during my degree in Psychology and Neuroscience at Cambridge University. My thesis was on how neurotransmitters affect regulatory centres in the brain, and thereby regulate mood and behavioural change. There are internal and external factors that contribute towards the balance of neurotransmitters, and ultimately how we feel, think and behave.When they become imbalanced, this can lead to stress, depression and anxiety. This is an area of increasing focus as we see record levels of stress and burnout, with 350 million people affected by common mental health issues worldwide. These individuals are desperately seeking solutions, as well as the companies they work for, and the public sector caring for them.These levels are especially pronounced in the millennials who live super busy and stressful lives; they often search for immediate solutions and quick fixes. Feeling depressed? Take some anti-depressants. Want to sleep? Take some sleeping tablets. People know how they want to feel, and if that differs from how they currently feel, they will self-prescribe and expect an immediate change. But these quick fixes can exacerbate the issue and result in even worse mental health.This is working insanely well for some people - look at Wim Hof, who climbed Everest wearing just shorts and a T-shirt, Michael Phelps, who won 8 Olympic gold medals in the same week, or Richard Branson who runs a multi-billion empire of 300 businesses. These titans are stretching the definition of what\u2019s possible.These people are not super-human. They are normal people who mastered one specific skill: the art of accessing powerful mental states. States where they can experience heightened creativity, increased productivity and accelerated problem-solving. But, more importantly, a sense of peace and calm that let them deal with any life situation.If you are thinking right now \u201cyeah, I get that but they are professional high-performance athletes and businessmen\u2026\u201d, you are right. We are not saying that everyone should strive for that level of performance, but in our world today, it is imperative to at least get the basics right. The techniques they use are fundamental to ensure our needs are met and we stay motivated! We live in an ever increasing stressful environment with record levels of stress and burnout. It\u2019s no wonder that one in three people are suffering from some poor mental health and it cost UK companies \u00a334.9bn in 2017.In today\u2019s world, we all need those \u201csuper powers\u201d not to just be productive, but keep our minds healthy!With increasing awareness of the mind-body connection, people are moving towards more natural alternatives. That means instead of, say, reaching for the coffee, increasingly people will find another way to wake up or focus, say by meditating or exercising. Instead of taking sleeping\/anti-anxiety pills, 64% of millennials will use music to de-stress. These new ways are appealing because they are accessible, scalable and rarely harmful.In wellbeing, mindfulness is one of the hottest industries out there with companies like Headspace rumoured to be surpassing a half billion dollar valuation (valued at 250m in 2015) as people look for ways to focus better and de-stress. And, although music is already a huge industry in terms of consumption, there has been a revival in the past ten years, with the people now willing to pay for it, as exemplified in the latest Spotify IPO\u2019s filing. Moreover, Spotify noted that the mood and activity playlists are what are driving the business and the whole industry forward. Just take a browse on Youtube for videos and music for sleep, including this one with 62m hits and it\u2019s clear this is not niche, but instead fully incorporated into the lives of many of us.While meditation and music playlists work to some extent to alter mental states, they still have some challenges to become truly impactful and transformation for everyone, anytime and anywhere. On one hand, meditation does not have the engaging, fun factor, variety, nor fits into many people\u2019s current lifestyles. On the other hand, music, as we consume it, is not made for purpose with transformative and scientific principles to have a brain altering effect. Where people end up turning to, for example YouTube, the content is of poor quality and fragmented. This puts the burden on the user to search, use a try-and-fail approach to select it without any \u201cobjective\u201d vetting. Most importantly, what is lacking in these solutions is an ability to measure their efficiency, which is a complete must if we want to research, track and improve them.There is proven research that shows the unique mind and body altering effects of music. At a high level, this includes: how the elements of the music can be changed, such as tempo, pitch and timbre, to affect arousal (e.g heart rate, pupils dilation), mood and creativity; how the brain syncs naturally to frequencies around it, thus by manipulating them you can entrain it into specific frequency bands that are linked to specific mental states. At a deeper level, the associations, anchors, memories and the way we listen (passive or active) all affect our perception of music and its efficiency to bring us into the desired states. For example, music for relaxation and focus is more effective if it is new and has no associated memories. Moreover, tapping into the power of music one can ease some depressive symptoms, increase the neuroplasticity of the brain and help with pain-relief.The use of music for healing may have originated more than thirty thousand years ago. But this art was lost as it began being used as a mainstream entertainment tool. More recent research into the effects of music are under-utilised and haven\u2019t been fully translated from experiments into real life applications. Moreover, there has not been much focus on individual by individual variations which are important in the application of music as we know music preferences play are a key components to it success.And although music is not being used to its full potential to alter moods, almost all of us can feel its impact and potential even if we don\u2019t fully understand it. We seek its\u2019 uplifting properties, almost subconsciously, every day.So what if, we master the science and art of changing states using music? With its universal appeal, how many people can we help?For all the reasons explained above, we created ZONE. The first scientific, personalised and transformative app to get you to any state of mind (\u201cZone\u201d) at the touch of a button. We are creating a new way for you to consciously and effectively use music for a wide range of positive emotional and performance effects, by applying a unique methodology based on science and Artificial Intelligence.We have initially created music with music therapists, scientists and musicians to get you into a relaxed and sleepy state. We will also offer clinically backed music alongside our house-created sound to help people with more severe mental problems like anxiety, burnout, and depression. After helping people relax, we will then expand into further states, including focus and energise.How does it work?1. Powered by ScienceZone composes new, engaging, music based on scientific principles with the help of experienced music therapists and music scientists. Which means it actually works and gets you to your desired state fast.2. Powered by Artificial IntelligenceOur sound is made in a unique layered format that let us change music in real time to enhance the experienceBefore and after each session on the Zone app, we take heart rate measurements, either using your phone or through integration with your heart monitor e.g. your Fitbit or Apple watch. We will combine this with data such as your daily activity, exercise and sleep patterns to predict exactly which song would, for example, be best to help you slow your heart rate when you want to wind down, or help you focus.3. Created with innovative musiciansWe collaborate with musicians you love to create content with our scientific standards and that fit the task at hand, while maintaining the artists signature flair.4. Easy to use and on demandThe Zone app is one solution for multiple moods and on-demand. No more wasting time or energy browsing multiple apps and websites, no more ads (never!), no interruptions, just your Zone on-demand when you need it.I\u2019m Saira Gill, the CEO and co-founder of Zone. I have spent the last ten years building and scaling tech companies (including Groupon\/Rocket), investing and advising companies (Investec and Balderton Capital), as well as mentoring startups (Techstars). Since studying Psychology and Neuroscience at Cambridge University, I have been obsessively interested in how the brain works and improving wellbeing. This is manifested in my daily obsessive exercising (Barry\u2019s bootcamp and yoga), healthy eating and meditating to music.This is what led me last year to join the Zinc\u2019s accelerator programme (read more about Zinc below!).This is where I met my co-founder and CTO of Zone, Yassine Landa, when we joined the Zinc program five months ago. He is an amazing developer and data scientist, on top of being incredibly erudite and funny! We naturally gravitated towards each other through our passion for holistic wellbeing, self-tracking, and music; in terms of listening, but also its incredible impact on the brain to affect how we think, feel and behave.We have brought on people to help us create the content and embed the science into our music. We have a network of advisors within the music industry, music therapy and at leading universities to help us on our mission.We\u2019re on a mission to help the 2 billion millennials fast track to their desired zone using music.We won\u2019t stop there but extend to other generations and more therapeutic uses.Our vision is to is to create a world where music is composed and adjusted in real time specifically for each individual.Building Zone has been already very rewarding and super fun! If you would like to use our product, sign up here (we are giving an exceptional year of free music to our beta testers and very early adopters) or contact us on info@zonenow.io. We will be hosting some live events, so stay tuned!Zinc is an \u201cincubator\u201d that selects individuals to build companies, with the aim of solving the world\u2019s greatest problems using scalable technology. Zinc is backed by LocalGlobe, a London-based Venture Capital firm led by Robin and Saul Klein.The first mission of the Zinc programme is to improve women and girls\u2019 mental and emotional health, and each business incubated must have the potential to help at least 100 million people in the developed world. Our program brought together 50 impressive people across technology, business, science and mental health that would then go on to form companies. We received extensive training in psychology and behavioural science, learned about the latest technologies and scientific research in the field and connected with world experts to give us a greater understanding of mental health.The result? 20 companies, ranging across sectors such as transportation, the workplace, fintech, digital health, perinatal support, the elderly, digital screen time, outdoor experiences, all of which are designed to improve women\u2019s and girls\u2019 mental and emotional health.Companies tackling everything from empowering children with good digital habits, to supporting women through the fertility and the perinatal cycle through to tackling loneliness and isolation in later life.Written byWritten by","5943":"On 28th April 2017, I woke up around 9 am, checked the phone for notifications, as I do every morning, and in the spam of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d messages there was an email, from the company I dreamed of working for \u2014 Prezly just hired me as remote JavaScript developer.It has been almost a year from that day, I want to go back and reflect on how my life changed since that day, because it has changed a lot.Returning to that day of my 25th birthday, during dinner with my mother, sister and a couple of friends, I announced that I have a job in the field I had devoted one year of my life studying for, and I would be moving to Spain, the first stop in my digital nomad journey.At the time I was living with my mother, sister and 2 cats in a small town near Venice, Italy.I never liked it there. It felt more like a cage than a town, really small, quite uneventful and surely not a cradle of change.After 25 years there I was ready to start the first flight.I didn\u2019t have a proper setup, just the old family computer and a 200\u20ac Chromebook I bought so I could study anywhere, with the clear limitations that a Chromebook can have (can\u2019t install anything!).During my first week at Prezly I\u2019ve bought a laptop worthy of the name, a ThinkPad T460p (that I still use).For me this was one of my hardest decisions. It was a really expensive piece of hardware, around 1800\u20ac, quite a blow to my savings for a future that I still had to digest, and surely one I was not sure I would be able to keep.When my first salary arrived I was ready to pack. It was 6x \u2014 8x higher than anything I\u2019ve ever earned, almost matched the total of my savings, it was still a little below industry standard, as I was a gamble to hire, I was put on a month tryout with a lower salary.With the money in my bank account I rented a shabby flat in Valencia, Spain. The impostor syndrome in me was calculating how much I needed to survive one year if I lost the job. I concluded that just two Prezly paychecks I could have lived alone for one year before going back home in Italy.Shabby rent was 300\u20ac month, utilities were 100\u2013150\u20ac, food around 100\u20ac, I was living the life, but on a budget, and scared to death to lose it all.After my month trial, my boss was impressed in my achievements so, not only I wasn\u2019t getting fired as the impostor syndrome predicted, but I was getting a 16% raise!With more money and a city famous for beaches and good weather + middle of the summer you\u2019d think I spent the wildest season of my life.Not really.When I decided to start seriously learn web development, I dedicated myself to it entirely, I was working a standard 30 hours-a-week job, and I would study in every possible slice of time I could get, I would go home and study again, eat, study more, go to sleep around 2 am, wake up at 8, rinse and repeat.I wouldn\u2019t go out with friends, nor to the cinema, nothing, just practice and study, contribute to that project, learn that framework and so on.Did I waste one year of my life?It\u2019s a question I have been asking myself for a long time now.I sacrificed a lot of things and gained a lot of other things: A job I\u2019m proud of, earning more than enough to live comfortably, a passion, getting to know a lot of like minded people around the world.I liked it, to be honest. If I could go back, I would do it again.So back to Valencia, and how I spent my summer:Working, and studying.In the beginning I was thinking \u201cI\u2019m the new guy, this is my first job as developer, I need to learn\u201d, as my excuse to behave exactly as I did before, not using the opportunity I had to improve my life (or get one).All my checkups with my boss\/manager were extremely positive, except for the fact that I was always working, he did and does not like it at all.After a few month of this, I end up as the sole front-end developer (comically, we had only one back end dev too!), on top of this, we decided to design our own hiring tests for front & back end (take home assignments) to get a better insight into the candidates and streamline the hiring process while reducing risks.While it might seem that the amount of work I had increased a lot, we mitigated the issue with careful planning around our priorities as a team.The amount of work, while sightly increased, remained pretty much constant and doable during a standard working day.Yet this provided me a new excuse to work even more, trying to push forward what we couldn\u2019t prioritise. I was still putting in more and more hours than what I was supposed to, but I still loved it.A couple of months later a really close friend from Italy came visit me in Spain. He wasn\u2019t really happy to see me working all the time, and as a good friend he raised his concerns about this. We spent hours and hours in the middle of the night talking, but in the end, as I did with all the previous warnings, I ignored everything.Fast forward to December \u201917, I have a task with a scope as big as the Universe \u2014 building a new editor for our main app.Our editor was always a weak point for us, my predecessor spent months implementing a new one based on a popular JavaScript WYSIWYG editor.I don\u2019t say based casually: during the process of developing the editor, he ended up forking official repository & main plugins repository, built on top of both and then wrote some others plugins from scratch that were not available at the time. Since these plugins were based on the custom one, they were not compatible with the default API.It was a mess. It was not compatible with new technologies and was very hard for us to maintain. There were a lot of bugs we could not fix, and features left halfway done that we could not finish. We never released it out of beta.It was a monument to complexity, too expensive to update and too expensive to maintain.The task to rewrite a new editor from scratch fell into my hands, my opportunity to shine even more and put in place a marvel of front-end development, with modular clean code, the right comments, easy to maintain and keep updated.The task was titanic, I started from scratch and created a working demo in no time. But, what I was missing were a list of custom features that we have in our current app, so I focused on the first one and started hacking even more. The feature ended up being a bit more complex than what it was supposed to be, and I was spending more and more time on it.I remember Christmas working on it, New Year\u2019s thinking how to fix it.I was already late for the set date, which should have been the week before the holidays, but it was January and I still couldn\u2019t do it. Why is that? I was a decent developer, others made it, why couldn\u2019t I? The more time I was spending on it, the less it was close to be finished.Soon my team realised what was happening, I was burning myself on it. A colleague pair programmed with me for 2 days, then worked on it alone for another 2 and in the end we had a working example.We paired on every other feature still missing, so no one had to work alone on it and risking the same. I\u2019m glad to say we succeeded in it.With the new year approaching, I took a deep look at where I was in my life.My 2016 was spent getting ready for a job.My 2017 was spent making sure I could excel at that job.What would 2018 look like?The December failure taught me a lot about what I was worth as a developer and as a human, how I needed to make sure to be happy to be able to push the quality code and insight I want my company to have.During the first few days of the year I got a new apartment. I was looking for quite some time, apartment hunting is a pain, worse than burning out from your job.New apartment looks really amazing (you can see it up there, just below the title \ud83d\udc46), for the first time I have something for myself I\u2019m glad to call home.Sure, it costs way more than the old one, but it\u2019s where I work from and where I spend most of my time. Why shouldn\u2019t I be happy with the place I live in?Before I didn\u2019t care enough about anything other than having a laptop and an internet connection, now I realise I need to be happy too, something I never considered before.Next point on the list, I\u2019m not struggling by any means, I don\u2019t live in an expensive city, it\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t care enough before.I want to see the value I\u2019m providing be rewarded accordingly.I took a week to prepare my argument, gathering all my accomplishments, the feedback received and everything could help my case in asking for a huge 40% raise.The day of my checkup with my boss, we\u2019re sitting in a cafeteria in Belgium (I was there for a week for some planning with the rest of the development team), when I decided to ask him about it.He shuts me up almost instantly with a single sentence: \u201cWe both know you need a raise, the question is how much?\u201dWith that settled, the rest was just juggling with the amount, and we reached a good compromise, 16% now and the remainder with a new contract in the coming months.This is just the beginning of my 2018, for the first time in 2 years, I\u2019m reading some non-code related books, and I\u2019m going to travel more and spend time trying to reach happiness, instead of just improving my skills as developer.From what I\u2019ve seen already, this shift will help me even more becoming a better developer than the previous approach did.Focusing my full life on a single thing, becoming a good developer, is something I do not regret doing, but it was highly unsustainable and I can\u2019t keep it up anymore.Now it\u2019s the resting time after that hard session at the gym, when your muscles have time to grow.I\u2019m looking forward to this year as a human, front end developer and digital nomad.Written byWritten by","5944":"Because sometimes when things are getting too stressful the answer is to do absolutely nothing to fix that, and to just draw pictures instead, all while continuing to ignore the things that are causing the stress in the first place.Ok\u2026 that\u2019s it for now. I should probably go open those emails I\u2019ve been ignoring for several weeks.Written byWritten by","5946":"Bam! This experience was a money shot. I had surprising insights each time, all profound, all consciousness expanding for me. And it was so much fun. Floating is number 2 of 9 strategies over 9 weeks to see how effective they are in creating space for increased clarity. It was powerful, and I am hooked. I will definitely be incorporating floating into my life as a regular practice.Like the rest, floating needed to meet my criteria for creating space. It had to be a stillness practice, with the ability to slow me down, be a gateway to presence and have the potential to reveal emotional blocks to my clarity. Floating delivered. It does so by diminishing the external sensory inputs of sight, sound, smell, touch and more, leaving your full attention on your inner world. From there, the experience is up to you.Unless you have access to an anti-gravity chamber, I don\u2019t think there is anything else that can give you the experience of floating free of gravity. Except actual space. Interstingly, this is exactly how I start my muscle relaxation process. I imagine I shoot up into space, I\u2019m wrapped in vast emptiness, and I just feel the float. So, to be able to do something like this in the flesh, well it was irresistible.Floating facilities have been popping up all over the United States and Europe. While it may seem like something new, float tanks have been around since the 1950\u2019s. Back then research on float tank\/sensory deprivation effects focused on things like creativity, connection to others and concentration. I think we missed out on some important data all those decades.The sensory deprivation chamber has been the most important tool that I\u2019ve ever used for developing my mind. Joe RoganEnthusiasts of the isolation float tank report an unbelievable array of mental, emotional, even spiritual\/consciousness expanding benefits. Like enhancement of creativity, mental clarity, awareness and their personal meditative practices. They describe improvement in problem solving, concentration and focus. Most describe feelings of well-being, a sense of serenity and an increase in vibrancy and energy. Many report a sense of peace, connectedness to others, connectedness to the body and to their inner world. Some report the ability to have an experience more psychedelic in nature.I can confidently say it [flotation] is one of the most powerful medicines I have worked with. It tells the same Truth as psychedemia, just perhaps in a whisper instead of a chorus. Aubrey Marcus, OnnitPhysical enhancements reported include a decrease in the physical symptoms of stress, improved sleep cycles, improved healing after injury, an increase in athletic prowess and a boost in circulation.Right alongside enthusiasts of the float tank are medical researchers that are contributing to a more recent and growing body of findings that suggests floating can help people with mental and physical ailments. It shows floatation is an effective, cost efficient, readily available and non-invasive way to treat stress-related illness. Stress-related illness is \u2018code\u2019 for most illnesses today.Specific ailments shown to be responsive to flotation including anxiety (PTSD), depression, burnout, fatigue, pain relief (fibromyalgia, arthritis), insomnia, trouble concentrating (ADD, ADHD), addictions, migraines and hypertension. In addition to enhancing healing after injury, it has positive effects on the immune system.The float tank promises to induce complete relaxation of the muscles all over the body, with the experience of weightlessness. This turns off the body\u2019s \u2018fight or flight\u2019 stress response. The mind can quiet down and become (and stay) still in the distraction free environment.Tank technology provides most of the sensory deprivation by cutting off sources of light and noise, controlling the water and air temperature (it\u2019s the same as your body), eliminating odor in the air or water, eliminating touch (other than what you intentionally touch and occasional contact with the tank).When suspended in the water and engulfed by total darkness, there is an almost immediate loss of another sense; proprioception. Spatial orientation and the sense of the relative positions of your body parts, or the body in space, doesn\u2019t happen without external cues. This can be pretty disorienting to some, but the illusion subsides.I decided to see if I could turn up the intensity of the experience by floating 3 times in 4 days. The facility in my community (Revival Wellness) is wonderful; the environment is attractive and it is clean and well maintained. It was clear after the first float how important cleanliness and quiet are to the experience.I arrived early to fill out minimal paperwork, was escorted to float room #2 and received the simple directions;1-Take a shower-that\u2019s one way the tanks stay clean for everyone.2-If you have long hair secure it, otherwise it will float around and cause some distraction if it touches you. This is also why you float naked so you aren\u2019t distracted by feeling what you are wearing.3- Put your earplugs in to both enhance the quiet and keep salt water out of your ears. This is optional, but highly recommended.4- There is a small bottle of fresh water and a dry face cloth in case you inadvertently (by touching your own face or splashing yourself) get the saltwater in your eyes. It will sting.5-Once you are in the water and close the tank door, you can turn the light off if you wish, or leave it on.6-When your hour is up the light will come back on, and a low voice will tell you your float time is over.7-Shower again to rinse off the salt. Which by the way, leaves your skin feeling soft.8- When you are dressed, leave your room quietly to respect the experience of others.That\u2019s it. Anything that happens in the tank is your experience. There is no right or wrong way to do it, no two experiences are the same. And, it\u2019s not possible to drown, even if you fall asleep.\u201cWhen I first tried a sensory deprivation tank, people thought I had lost my mind. In fact, I had found it.\u201d Ryan LillyMy first float was a little awkward. My mind was looking for reasons to create concern. I tried the light off then had to turn it back on for a minute. After a few minutes of floating, I began to think I couldn\u2019t breathe because of perceived mugginess. \u201cMaybe the air vent isn\u2019t working\u2019. I knew it wasn\u2019t true, but I was distracted nonetheless. \u2018Maybe I should leave the tank door open for air?\u2019 I regrouped and dropped all of that.Another few minutes and the thought came, \u2018can I do this for a whole hour?\u2019 I concentrated on releasing each muscle, letting go of everything that felt tight, until I couldn\u2019t perceive anymore tension.It was completely dark. Perceptually, I couldn\u2019t tell the difference between my eyes open or closed. It was completely quiet except for my occasional movements. There was no tactile sensation other than the waterline that framed the part of my face above water. It was hard to distinguish where the waterline was most places on my body. Once in a while, a foot would make contact with the tub, but then gently move away.Thought chatter occurred about earlier events of the day, then about the rest of the day. That soon began to die down. I reminded myself of my intention for the float, inviting the space for clarity by whatever means that took. So I concentrated on even deeper relaxation of my muscles.The mind creates its own activity in the absence of external stimuli. As in sleep, the unconscious began sorting through recent snippets of experience it deemed valuable, weaving old and new \u2018pieces of stuff\u2019 together, making new, conscious connections. Only I was awake and watching this take place.Then a visualization of \u2018me\u2019 appeared, in the future. And all at once I experienced a \u2018me\u2019 that was new. And powerful. In this visualization I felt complately free of inhibitions, I felt it throughout my body. I had the experience of old restricting beliefs no longer present. I watched myself easily do things I would not normally feel free to do, feeling spontaneous and unencumbered. Where did this come from? I became aware of the broad smile on my face.My body felt glorious, as if every inch inside and out was perfect and thriving. I felt completely connected to its \u2018nature,\u2019 to the unencumbered, stress and inhibition-free way that it naturally is. So this is what the body feels like without the oppressive load of the mind.Without the mind piling inhibitions on the body, there was a sense of greater connection to it and appreciation of it. The body was enjoyable to inhabit, easy and friendly, loving and appreciating. I was in complete enjoyment, utter stillness and awash with satisfaction. This seemed to last a very long time.Then I noticed a sensation, a pressure that felt like my head, shoulders and butt were in contact with the bottom of the tank. \u2018How could that be?\u2019 I had to run my hand beneath me to be sure that in fact I was still afloat. I concluded that my mind was interpreting residual muscle tension as pressure, and I was interested to see if it persisted in tomorrow\u2019s float. Since it wasn\u2019t going away, I played with tiny twisting movements that enhanced the sensation of floating. This felt just like in my imaginings of floating in outer space.The process felt like \u2018old hat\u2019 today, excitement to get in and enjoy every last one of my 60 minutes. Relaxing of the body happened much quicker, as if it knew what to do on cue. I had none of the hesitant thoughts of yesterday, none of the pressure on my backside.I soon noticed my heartbeat throughout my entire torso, including places I\u2019d never felt it before. The mind\u2019s eye took me on a little voyage inside my heart in an exploratory way. Like in that 1966 movie Fantastic Voyage where this tiny nano-ship travels through the body and encounters all kinds of giant, scary, amazing structures and activity.There was the awareness that the heart doesn\u2019t beat day in and day out in the way we think it does. That there is quite a bit of precise variation, adjusting and responding to its environment. I felt amazement for the intelligence of that. There was a sense of gratitude for the heart and the body that it drives. How at once it is incredibly powerful and resilient, yet fragile and temporary. \u2018Mine will die one day\u2019 I thought, \u2018could be any day.\u2019 And floating in that tank, that was perfectly ok.After noticing some trivial thought dialogue continuing in the background, I directed my attention toward my intention; opening space for clarity. Almost immediately I got images; a movie in my mind. Ok, I see now that in the float, my communication with myself is in images. This is the domain of the imagination, not the intellect. Then I saw the images are actually always active, always communicating, I just don\u2019t notice them.Oh. \u2018This personality\u2019 has a preference for thought and thinking. And that thinking obscures this internal communication that\u2019s always available. And then the insight; \u2018this personality\u2019 all too often interprets information from the physical senses as factual. \u2018I\u2019 know my physical senses are the least reliable source of information, yet I see I still unconsciously believe and trust what they tell me, by default. And this preference for externally generated data would over time, displace my trust in my own internal \u2018intuition\u2019, my inner clarity. This feels like what\u2019s inspiring me\u2026 it\u2019s clarity from the inside I want as my primary driver. I really DO need to question everything, particularly my physical senses.Heading into my third float in 4 days, I\u2019m very relaxed and wide open. Nothing has bothered me for days. I get in the tank and relax all my musculature almost immediately. The \u2018wind-down chatter\u2019 happens briefly, then turns into a contemplation of feelings of well-being, connection and lightness that take its place. I drop deeply into my internal world.I contemplate the Self I\u2019ve spent time with in the float. That Self is completely open minded and open hearted. That Self is unencumbered by the physical body and the personality forged by a lifetime of conditioning. That Self is free and curious and light and adventurous, delighted to be having this human experience. I am that Self. I am not the body, I am not the personality or its identity. That is a role I\u2019m playing, dressed in this human suit. The game is to see through all that, through the \u2018story line\u2019 playing out in the world of form. This is another drive for this broader clarity. To be unencumbered by what obscures and stay connected to the truth. There is that pull again. Unencumbered.This inner contemplation abruptly ended and I felt once again fully immersed in the aliveness of body and emotion. I felt awake to the complexity and genius of it all. And now the experience was more intense, even sensual!I was feeling emotion as if it were a recreational drug; specifically the emotion of love and appreciation for being in my body. I had the thought that \u2018for most of my life I have had a love-hate relationship with my body.\u2019 The kind that is a result of a culture that creates fictitious standards and then has only judgement for anything or anyone that doesn\u2019t meet them. I thought about how I, like countless others, turned that judgement on me and beat myself with it for years. Yet in that moment, I couldn\u2019t feel what that self judgement felt like. It was as if that was someone else\u2019s story. The real truth is, my body is powerful and beautiful and was my first \u2018proof of abundance\u2019 in this life. Now there was only a deep sense of belonging in my body and the truth of its intelligence and innocence. I understood I have the choice and the power stay in this truth.When the float was over there was a sense of being clean and fresh, well beyond the salt bath and 2 showers. I had also washed away what was no longer serving me.\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize how much everything is a distraction,\u201d Joe RoganIf I tried to sum up the value of my float experiences, it would be the ability of that environment to show me the experience of \u2018being\u2019 that I am shooting for. In the tank I can feel what it is to be unblocked, light and free on many levels. And it happens fast.In the short time since I began this journey, to \u2018get very, very good\u2019 at finding personal clarity, I have come to appreciate what a vigorous and progressive dynamic has started within me. I definitely feel on a mission, and all of me is on board.I know the discovery and releasing of blocks to clarity can happen while participating in any one of these exercises or experiences. But more importantly, each one can be just the beginning if you so choose. If you continue to feed finding clarity. You see, it\u2019s like an unfolding flower that keeps blooming even after you stop watching it. It doesn\u2019t know time. It interrupts your day by waltzing into your thoughts, or wakes you up in the middle of the night, intent on showing you that the bloom is still opening. Be ready for it. Like I said, bam!What\u2019s Next?I can\u2019t wait for my next experience. I haven\u2019t decided yet if it will be Ecstatic Dance or using the Muse during meditation. Yet I am understanding that it really doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m in communication with my Self. And I\u2019m doing all the listening.For more in this series:On Removing Blocks and Creating Space for Clarity: An Introduction to the Finding Clarity SeriesFinding Clarity Series #1: PEW-12, a Free Writing Technique for Releasing Blocked, Toxic EmotionWritten byWritten by","5950":"March is my birthday month so, naturally, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about identity.For all my life, I\u2019ve felt a creeping dread as my birthday approached that I would soon need to part with the age I\u2019d identified with for the past 365.And I\u2019m not talking about the typical \u201comg I\u2019m entering my mid-thirties and feel old AF.\u201dI\u2019m talking I used to cry when six was out and seven was in. Never again was I ever going to be six again! For a whole year I\u2019d proudly declared \u201cI\u2019m SIX!\u201d and then suddenly, I was no six more. (And in case you were wondering how the transition went from single to double digits \u2014 it was traumatizing.)Some three decades later, I\u2019m no longer identifying with my age but I am recognizing the parts of myself that no longer serve me, identities I\u2019ve outgrown or no longer wish to have.And when it comes to behavior change or building sustainable habits, your identity is what can hold you back or set you free.Know your identities.To know your identities,(\u201cI\u2019m not good with numbers\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m an unlucky person\u201d), is to know how you will show up in the world. Your behavior is a direct reflection of what you believe yourself to be.Imagine if I continued to identify as a six year old for the rest of my life? I\u2019d never get a job \u2014 let alone think I could move out of the house! Who you think you are holds the potential for who you can become.And despite this potential, many of the identities we carry around are fundamentally false \u2014 labels or beliefs we\u2019ve created that are either self-imposed or put upon us through external sources (societal norms, culture, etc.).These false identities hold a lot of power over us. When you identify too closely with something that simply isn\u2019t real, you shut yourself off from change, possibility, and growth.For example, here are some false identities that were previously holding me back:None of those things were true \u2014 they were simply outdated stories I let myself believe.These are some current identities I\u2019m trying to dismantle:These identities don\u2019t align with my current goals, values, or ideal vision of myself and thus create friction and frustration as I attempt to make the changes I want.In order to grow, old identities must die for new ones to emerge.For example, if for for the majority of your adult life you\u2019ve identified as the fun party girl whose M.O. was to go out and keep the party going \u2014 but now you want to be the kind of person who gets up early on the weekends and goes to a yoga class followed by the farmer\u2019s market, this new farmer\u2019s market identity is going to be in direct conflict with the party girl identity.A reckoning between the two must happen. Who matters more? The party girl or the farmer\u2019s market? One identity will have to take a backseat for the other to take the wheel.Let them go.I understand it\u2019s not that simple.Saying goodbye can be hard. Don\u2019t rush it \u2014 but also, don\u2019t delay. When you\u2019re ready, take the time to mourn your loss and recognize the good times. That identity served you at some point in your life but is no longer giving you what you need. Onwards and upwards \u2014 thanks for the for the memories!But what about those beliefs that just won\u2019t budge?Per my last post, many of us hold identities that have been determined by an external source \u2014 societal norms based on age, race, gender, class, what degree you do or do not have, where you grew up, what institution you\u2019re part of, your parents, your partner, your friends, etc..These identities are especially stubborn because you and everyone else around you might actually believe them. The \u201cI\u2019m not good at excel because I\u2019m a girl who likes to talk about feelings\u201d is a good example of false construct we\u2019ve created as a culture.Realizing this falsity has allowed me to ditch the identity and broaden my horizons.Furthermore, when you adopt an identity based on someone else\u2019s expectations \u2014 or an outdated expectation of yourself! \u2014 you drift away from your true self, your north star.And without your north star, you\u2019re lost.Decisions are harder. You say weird things. You act in ways your regret.You feel stuck\u2026 anxious. Not yourself.The friction between who you are and who you think you should be is creating drama and dis-ease because you are not living a life according to you.So if you are actively wanting to make a change \u2014 or simply feel that something is \u201coff\u201d \u2014 take a look at your identities and where they come from. It may be a false identity that is holding you back.And if you think you have no control over this \u2014 perhaps that\u2019s an identity to look more closely at! The \u201cI have no control over my life\u201d also known as the \u201cthis is just who I am\u201d or \u201cthis is how the world works\u201d can always be re-evaluated.We always, always have the power to reclaim our lives, even when our identities have run amok.You are the purveyor of your own reality \u2014 what you believe is true, will be true.Written byWritten by","5974":"\u201cI want you to see my color! If you don\u2019t see my color, you don\u2019t see me!\u201dThere we were, sitting around our dinner table with our friend, Naliah. Two white Americans, raised to be \u201ccolorblind,\u201d with an African American friend who wants us to see her for who she is.She wants us to see her beautiful, ebony skin color alongside her character and competency. She wants us to understand she is shaped \u2014 but not confined \u2014 by her black skin.You see, this word \u201ccolorblind,\u201d holds several definitions. One is to attempt to view all people equal in value. Skin color should not matter; it is a person\u2019s character that does. My husband and I have parents who raised us with this thinking. We were taught to see each person as equal in God\u2019s sight.We\u2019ve brought that thinking into our adulthood as well. We\u2019ve raised our children to think like this, too. And, for the most part, I think we did them well.But another, more troubling, definition of \u201ccolorblind\u201d is to fail to recognize problems exist in our country and in our world because of skin color.We can easily (pardon the pun) whitewash the distinctive of race in our efforts to treat everyone equal. And, even when the genuine intent is to view others as equal, the impact of this approach can be one of minimizing the very existence of discrimination and prejudice throughout our society.Unfortunately, in part because the first definition of colorblind holds \u2014 and especially because my husband and I are white \u2014 I believe we had unwittingly fallen prey to the mindset of the second.Reading Michelle Alexander\u2019s The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness a couple years ago opened my colorblind eyes.While a full analysis of this seminal work is not my objective here, let me give one personal observation and application. Colorblindness, while well-meaning by some (I fall in this category, I believe), also contributes to the problem of systemic racial inequality in the United States (and in many other countries as well).While colorblindness may not be as obvious as white nationalism, for example, not recognizing or minimizing the challenges most people of color face every day falls short of what our world needs for a better future.Indeed, the ascendancy of Barak Obama in 2008 to the U.S. presidency caused some to posit we were entering \u201cpost-racial\u201d America. These people also pointed to the likes of Stevie Wonder, Beyonc\u00e9, Michael Jordan, Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith, Steph Curry, Halle Berry, Serena Williams and so many others as some kind of evidence we had turned a corner as a nation.Reality is, whether in politics, sports, entertainment, business or any other field, the percentage of African Americans rising to the top remains miniscule compared to the total. And this cuts across most industries.The majority of African Americans face a great deal of discrimination on a regular basis. And their skin color defines their experience. Even if some would rather think otherwise.This is the state of our broken world.Now, I don\u2019t live in the U.S. South. I live in \u201cprogressive\u201d California. So it would seem racial discrimination is not something we observe \u2013 nor people of color experience \u2014 on a daily basis.But, sadly, this is not the case.Over the years, even living in California, we\u2019ve seen evidence of this mistreatment.An African American courtesy van driver once shared stories with me (on a simple 20-minute trip) about some of the derogatory comments he had received from local customers due to his skin color. (He was very cordial throughout the conversation.)A close African American friend served in a municipal police department for 15+ years. He was passed over for promotion after improving his education and qualifications. Who was promoted? White officers.(There is a silver lining to this story, however. He filed a racial discrimination case and eventually won after a sustained period of uncertainty.)And then there is our friend, sitting in front of us. Naliah works in a public sector job. She is highly educated and trained at what she does. She serves people on the fringes of society. She sees situations that most never do. She has a strong sense of justice, and purpose.Many of the clients she works with are Latino, from Central or South America. From a white person\u2019s \u201ccolorblind\u201d perspective, we would expect a sense of solidarity among people of color. Naliah aims to accomplish that through her work. But, in reality, she relates, many \u201cbrown\u201d people do not see it that way.\u201cYou know,\u201d she shared, \u201cthe slave trade in many of the Latin American countries was even larger than it was in the U.S. There is definitely a hierarchical mindset. Many of these clients wonder how I could be in a position to help them. They question my qualifications. And sometimes, they can be very rude.\u201dThis discussion made my heart cry. I so desperately want our land \u2014 and the world \u2014 to heal of the scourge of racial discrimination.The answer is not in any institution. It\u2019s not in a political leader. It\u2019s not in programs.No, the answer is at the individual heart level, which makes this problem extra challenging. Heart change is hard work.Changing hearts can come through education. I\u2019m all about quality education programs helping people to come to terms with their own stereotypes and biases.It can also happen through healthy dialogue and discussion, no question.But, at the most basic level, it comes at a point of humility. Recognizing I am no greater than the next person. Really understanding that at the deepest possible level.And it should not stop at mere understanding. We also are called to take steps to bring about change and healing in our world \u2014 a world broken, trapped in stereotypes, biases, prejudice, misunderstanding and selfish ambition.Tragically, in the current political landscape, both in the U.S. and in Europe, ethnocentrism and white nationalism are on the rise. I believe the need to be active agents who bring about positive change to this horribly distorted landscape is reaching new levels of consequence.And, because the world doesn\u2019t grasp the essential equality of humanity (no matter time, place, ethnicity, color or race), we need to recognize and acknowledge the presence of discrimination. Colorblindness is not the answer. We need to work in every way we can to bring the harmful aspects of colorblindness to an end.And prejudice? In the 21st century, it belongs buried in an unmarked grave.But the work starts in our own hearts.If this article moved you, you might find our ebook, You Can Be the Bridge: A CultureWeaver\u2019s Manifesto, both inspiring and a good next step.

At times, experiencing depression sucks the life out of me, or at least it feels that way.My husband once said to me, you sleep a lot. I go through periods when I do, yes. It\u2019s exhausting to carry what feels like 10,000 pounds of soul crushing misery wherever I go, when I\u2019m able to go.I believe there is a stigma associated with those who experience depression. I\u2019ve developed my own mini glossary on the topic. It goes something like this.\u201cDepressed people.\u201dI am not a depressed person. I\u2019m a person who experiences depression. This goes for all mental illnesses. People are not mentally ill. They experience mental illness.\u201cJust change your situation.\u201dOf course! I\u2019ll get right to work solving the unsolved mysteries of genetics and chemical imbalances in the brain. Once I\u2019m done doing that I\u2019ll cure cancer, too.\u201cMedication is bad for you.\u201dThere is some truth to this statement. Research studies have shown that long term use of psychiatric medications can actually cause premature death, the same as every other medication on the planet. However, that\u2019s not all research studies have shown.A symptom of untreated depression, suicide, can also shorten your lifespan. There have also been studies concluded showing that people who experience mental illness commonly have a shorter life span by an average of twenty years than those who do not experience mental illness for a number of reasons such as (but not limited to) poor physical health, smoking cigarettes, substance abuse issues, poor diets and sleep deprivation.As with everything in life it\u2019s a personal choice. Would I rather live 70 years with a better quality of life or shoot for 90 years and go for quantity? I think I\u2019ll stick with meds, thanks.\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine.\u201dYou\u2019ll be fine is code for I\u2019m not hearing you, I don\u2019t understand or believe you. This is based solely on my opinion and experience.\u201cYou need to have purpose\u201dUm, you mean other than being a mother, wife, human being, writer, artist, community member, etc? That\u2019s going to be tough to pull off as my schedule is rather booked with all of these non-purposes.\u201cJust step out of your comfort zone\u201dBecause experiencing depression is comfortable?\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with people who take medication and go to therapy.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong is being judged by those who say, act or feel this way.I think those who don\u2019t experience mental illness believe it\u2019s a negative thing, but that is not at all the case, not in my case anyway.I\u2019ve been able to transform my feelings and experiences into words that have connected with thousands of others. I have a voice for the voiceless. What some view as vulnerability, I view as strength and I\u2019ve been able to utilize this strength to write stories with openness and honesty that resonate with others. I consider this a gift. I have been given a gift in the form of experiencing depression.Along with medication and therapy, I\u2019ve developed coping tools and a lifestyle that empowers me to live and function to my fullest ability. It may not be the same level of others but I view myself as high functioning and successful. Here is my daily regime that\u2019s empowered me to be the best version of myself.I take my medication every day:I did not realize how badly I felt until I began taking psychiatric medication. It\u2019s provided me room to breathe, think and function. It\u2019s lifted a weight that was crushing me.I exercise and eat healthy:Medication and therapy alone is not enough. It\u2019s only part of my treatment plan. I also need to move my body, increase my heart rate and release endorphins. On my worst days I will exercise for ten minutes at a time for up to six to eight times per day.It\u2019s far too easy to eat my feelings and it\u2019s self destructive behavior. To improve my diet I\u2019ve replaced poor food choices with fruit and vegetables. It\u2019s lame but dying from obesity and heart disease would be even more lame.I stopped being obsessively productive:There are only so many hours in a day and rarely am I able to reach all of my goals. I used to be obsessed with the \u201cProductivity\u201d craze until I realized it was chipping away at the enjoyment I felt from my work.I stopped focusing on time and instead focused only on the task at hand. I\u2019ve learned to only deal with what\u2019s in front of me at the moment and not think about other projects. I understand why productivity is trendy. We tend to associate our completed tasks and goals with money.Money equates to stress and I found it far less stressful to trim my budget than to turn doing what I love into feeling like a chore.I stopped sacrificing myself for the sake of others: I get it. My family and friends love me, care for me and want the best for me. Sometimes that can feel pushy, or as if I\u2019m only following through to make them happy while I feel uncomfortable and at times inadequate because I\u2019m incapable of meeting those expectations.I\u2019ve learned to speak up for myself and share how I feel with them. I\u2019ve learned to ask them to do the same in return. Communication is key in any type of relationship. This has helped tremendously.I\u2019ll leave the door open by saying although I may not want to right now that doesn\u2019t mean I never will. Doing this has increased compromise and I\u2019ve learned how to grow within the relationship where I can meet my own needs while being considerate of their needs.Healthy relationships have a balance of give and take, and meeting half way.No, I don\u2019t want to go to the state fair with 40,000 other people. Yes, I would love to go for a walk with you to the coffee shop.I limit my internet usage and hang out at my local library instead:This is been most beneficial for me thus far.The internet is an outstanding tool for creatives. I have the ability to share my work with the entire cyber world 24 hours a day. I can also communicate with friends, share photos of my cats and watch Sponge Bob videos.The internet can also be hindering. It\u2019s a rabbit hole of misinformation and absorbs my valuable time.I love learning something new each day. This is a lifetime goal I have. The library is the perfect spot for autodidacts. Not only is it home to thousands of stories, adventurous and educational materials but they also have author readings, free classes on a wide variety of topics, hands on activities, a book club for critical thinking skills within a group and peace and quiet where I can be alone with myself and my thoughts.I stopped reading the news:The news is fear spreading and panic inducing and to make matters worse, the news has transformed from true reporting and journalism to anyone can post anything on the internet and people will believe it.If there is something so vitally important in the news that no global citizen should miss it, it will make it\u2019s way back to me via family or friends. There is no need to submit myself to it on a daily basis.Not only have I stopped reading the news, I\u2019ve even gone as far as to stop writing for the media. This has been equally, if not more so a relief and a decision I feel good about and proud of. I\u2019m no longer contributing to something I do not believe in. I\u2019d rather spend my time writing stories of hope, possibility and real life.I stopped limiting my creativity based on what I think others will want or what will make me money:Instead I create what feels good to me and what comes naturally for me, and what I believe will create a positive impact on others. Instead of being a sell out I\u2019ve opted to allow my confidence to guide me. I know if I continue to work hard, always do what I believe is the right thing and never give up I will eventually be rewarded for my perseverance.I scroll past anything self-help or personal growth:Self-help and personal growth have been huge topics for a few years now. One thing I dislike is most of what I\u2019ve read in the past fails to acknowledge it\u2019s a generalization or based off the writers own experience.While something may work for one person it does not mean it will work for another. It\u2019s not that simple, just the same as it\u2019s not as simple as someone saying, don\u2019t be depressed and then I\u2019m cured. In order to be the best version of myself I need to treat myself for who I am, an individual and not a stigma.\u00a9\ufe0f 2018, Erika Sauter.

Although it is healthy to let go of these things to a certain extent, it is also important to learn to listen to what these things are trying to tell us as well. Life is all about balance. These emotions are inherent in us for a reason and it is important for us to listen to what they have to say. That said it is equally important not to allow these emotions to overtake us and be more to us than their message. What is your anxiety telling you?The question that many of us struggle with is how do you know when it\u2019s time to let go of the anxiety and how do you know when it\u2019s time to listen to it? That is a mystery and a path that we all must discover for ourselves. As a general rule, if the anxiety continues without outcome it has become an unhealthy part of your life. The best way to rid yourself of the anxiety is to consider its meaning in full. Ignoring things does not make them go away regardless of what others say.If you are spending your time trying to ignore the feelings of anxiety and depression rather than dealing with them head-on, this could be the cause of your problem. Although having a chemical imbalance is very real to some people who are suffering from depression, for others depression is actually a message from the inner self asking to be heard. So you must become in touch with this voice within to find out what exactly it is trying to say to you. Is it time to move on to a different point in your life? Are you unhappy with your current situation? Perhaps it\u2019s time to seek out a new career or move to a new home.We go through life thinking that our situations are what they are and we should be happy to stay where we are. Although this is true to a certain extent, it also is detrimental to the inner self to lie and say that you are happy with the situation when you are really not. When you ignore the inner self, when you ignore your desires, the spirit becomes depressed. Perhaps you work too hard and you desire relaxation. When you refuse to listen to the voice depression and anxiety sets in. When you continue to ignore the voice, the anxiety proceeds.So here\u2019s the question, are you listening to your inner self? Are you listening to what you\u2019re anxiety is trying to say to you? Are you trying to avoid the negative emotions or mask them over with medication? Simply listening to yourself is the best antidepressant or anti-anxiety out there.Be honest with yourself. Ask yourself what the real cause of your anxiety and or depression are. Do not avoid the topic. If your problem is excessive worry and anxiousness, ask yourself what are you so worried about? Are you worried about losing your job? Are you worried about losing your loved ones? Whatever it is that you worry the most about will be a key indicator of the message.For example, if you are continuously worried about losing your job, is it possible that you are not putting your effort into the position? If you are not putting the effort into your position then why? Perhaps you are unhappy with your job and afraid to do something about it because of the financial ramifications. So you are not putting in the effort you should be putting in. The message your inner self is telling you is that you were unhappy with your career choice. As much as we don\u2019t want to listen to that message it\u2019s there nonetheless and we will suffer from the worry until it becomes acknowledged.When you are able to receive the message your anxiety is trying to transmit, then it is time to figure out what can be done to better your situation. There\u2019s always a solution, although it might be a difficult path to take. Sometimes we must suffer hardship to get to where we want to go.Let\u2019s go back to the example of being unhappy in your position. In what way can you better your situation when you are working in a job that is making you unhappy, but you and your family heavily rely upon? One scenario would say to decide what you want from your life career-wise. If you do not know, think about what you love. Do you love cooking? Painting? What direction do you want to be headed in? Because believe it or not you can have two careers at once.You could have a job that you go to to make money and you can have a career that makes you happy and fulfills you. The question is, what direction do you want to be headed in? Because believe it or not you can have two careers at once. You could have a job that you go to to make money and you can have another path that you are working towards. Perhaps your anxiety is telling you that you need something more.Looking at unhappiness in the career is only one example. The same can be said for your home life, your relationships, or anything else that may be causing you extreme anxiety or depression. The point is that instead of trying to avoid these emotions, it is very important to listen to them.This is not to say that you should be overtaken by them. If you discover you are unhappy with your work and feel anxiety and worry over this, it doesn\u2019t mean you should go out and quit your job. It just means you should be aware of how you feel and Should do the things to change the situation. Just listening to your inner voice is enough to ease the pain. It\u2019s a start. The rest is up to you.We wish you much luck in your journey ahead and hope you take the time to comment below and let us know what you think of this article.Join my CREATING PEACE WITHIN course\u2026an 8-week integrative mindfulness and meditation course to help reduce anxiety, stress, and fear.Related Article: 3 Unconventional Strategies for Coping with AnxietyToxic Thinking and How to Let it GoYou can also find me at heididellaire.com, lovewideopen.com and my podcast Love Wide Open with Heidi Dellaire\u00a9Love Wide OpenOriginally published at lovewideopen.com on April 18, 2018.Written byWritten by","6133":"I can do all the things adult humans can and should do, for the most part. On top of that, I can smile, laugh, and make a joke or two. I\u2019m usually pretty lighthearted. And yet, I am almost always kind of blue.I wish my blues were like one of the tunes Miles Davis played on his album, Kind of Blue. His music is beautiful. The song All Blue feels my aches. Each track on the album has a beginning, a middle, and an end. While my blues are endless. Sometimes they fade, other times they become a deep vivid shade of indigo. But mostly I\u2019m just kind of blue.I know there are people who don\u2019t feel like I do. But it feels like everyone I know has or has had some level of depression. Some medicate with alcohol or work and are able to stay in denial about their experience. Functional depression is still depression.There have been times in my life when I was happy or happ-ish all the time, and I lived virtually depression-free. I had a reprieve. It went into remission. I can only vaguely recall those times now. It\u2019s been a while. It seems to me that if I wasn\u2019t feeling an organic depression, I was feeling the situational type. But I have known many moments of joy and happiness in my life; enough to feel truly blessed.Nonetheless, I live within a blue cloud. Its mistiness dampens my spirit. Every day I work to defy it. I work to keep these feelings as light as possible.I\u2019ve only been knocked down by depression a few times in my life. It came at turning points. Depression signaled I needed to make a change in my life. It told me to walk away from my marriage. It told me to walk away from my career. It told me staying will kill you. I listened. I broke free. Things got better.Having depression is like walking a tightrope. You can keep moving forward with your life as long as you don\u2019t look down, or back, or up. Keep looking straight ahead. The least bit of doubt and you\u2019ll stumble and fall.When it comes to depression, there are a million metaphors and adjectives to describe it, but winning isn\u2019t one of them. There is no conquering depression. It\u2019s always there even when it fades into the background. It\u2019s a day by day, moment by moment dance for most of us.Every day I have to decide to say to my depression, I see you but, as Miles Davis asked, in Kind of Blue \u2014 So what?My internal dialogue sounds like this:.Living with depression means having discipline. It means having strategies for my body and mind.These are the few things I have to do to be a pale kind of blue:It\u2019s easy to take depression for granted. Blue is a beautiful color it\u2019s easy to get lost in its many shades. Self-destructive behaviors and self-isolation help draw you in deeper. And depression lies all the damn time.Don\u2019t listen to it. Listen to Miles or listen to one of the blues masters like B.B. King. When you think no one loves you, but your mother, let your feelings go with the music. Remind yourself; it\u2019s not true..Music can be very healing. So can nature. In my experience, anything beautiful that feeds our souls can help ease the pain of depression.I used to think I was too strong to be a \u201cdepressed person.\u201d I was in denial about it for a long time. It\u2019s not about strength or weakness.I know there\u2019s a chemical component, but I also believe those of us with depression have a great need to feed and nurture our souls. If we\u2019re not doing that, we become kind of blue or several shades darker.Whether you take a medication or meditation for your depression, look after your soul. It\u2019s where you live. Give it everything beautiful you can think of \u2014 movies, music, nature, art, books, cooking, create anything, even space.Depression reminds us to take care of ourselves and our lives.I\u2019m not sure I like the depression is a gift or a life coach spin. But depression does call on us to be kind to ourselves and why shouldn\u2019t we be? We are as worthy of our own love as is anyone else. We can be kind of other colors besides just blue.~\u00a9 2018, A. Breslin All Rights ReservedWritten byWritten by","6173":"Before dad died life was grand, or so it seemed that way. I was scared of my own shadow but my dad had a way of pulling me back and lifting me up. My first memory of a \u2018fear\u2019 was when my parents were trying to teach me how to insert a plug into an outlet properly. I remember crying and fretting that I was going to be shocked or electrocuted, how could a 5 year old even have those thoughts?Mom was very nervous but her nervousness came off as anger. When my parents were trying to teach me how to properly insert a plug into the socket my mom became increasingly upset with me as I cried, my dad had a soothing voice, he used humor when I became upset and he was able to guide me to insert the plug into the socket. Fear over!For whatever reasons, my mom never seemed as approachable as my dad. I remember my dad asking me if I would go to the store and pick up some bread and milk for mom, I told him no! I remember dad begging me in a very kind voice and I told him no again and said, \u201cTell Andy to go to the store!\u201d Andy is my brother and my dad told my brother he had to go to the store for our mom. My brother didn\u2019t argue and I sat there feeling like a princess because I got my way.We went camping a lot and I remember one incident when my mom told me to do something and I shot back with a big NO, I don\u2019t have to do that. Mom became angry and went to slap my cheek but I moved and her hand hit my lip. My lip began bleeding, it swelled and I was hysterical. My dad looked at my mom and said, \u201cI\u2019m running home to get a few things and I\u2019m taking Lisa with me.\u201d When we arrived home, he ran to the fridge and pulled some ice out and put it on my lip. Again, dad was my hero and I feared mom.Dad had a workshop in his garage and many times he would ask if I wanted to go with him to his workshop. It was just me and dad, I was a chatterbox and dad either had the patience of a saint or his love for me was so profound, he enjoyed listening. Looking back, I think dad had more patience because he wasn\u2019t home 24\/7 taking care of 5 children. He was able to pick and choose when he wanted to spend time with us. Mom didn\u2019t have that luxury since she was a stay at home mom.I have many fond memories of time spent with my dad and the last few I had were of my brother and I going ice fishing with dad on Lake Erie and boating on Lake Erie with my dad and his friend. Yes, dad was the fun parent but I can\u2019t fault my mom for that because their roles differed.Life changed in a MillisecondWhen I was 9 years old my dad wasn\u2019t around as much. He was either working or in bed, spending more and more time in bed over the months. I remember one particular day in January, it was dad\u2019s birthday and I brought his present up to him while he was lying in bed. I bought a saw for him with the intention that he would be back out in the garage using it, of course I would be there with him! He opened up my gift and said, \u201cI love the saw, I can\u2019t wait to go out to my workshop with you and use this!\u201d My reply: \u201cYea, if you ever get out of bed again!\u201d I sounded like a brat when I spoke to him. Hell, I was a brat because I knew I could get away with it.Less than 3 weeks after I purchased the sawMy father passed away when I was 10 years old. I had no clue that he was seriously ill. My mom tried to tell us, she said that dad was very ill and may never get out of bed again. Dad passed away in the 70\u2019s when talking about death and dying was fairly off limits. There wasn\u2019t hospice back then, no grief support for children or the spouse. In February of 1970 life changed forever as I knew it.After the funeralWe were surrounded by my parent\u2019s friend up until the funeral ended. Once the funeral was over and we returned home on a cold, blustery, sunny, winter day, we never spoke of our dad again. My memories of that time period are very sparse. My brother developed night terrors but I didn\u2019t know what they were, I would just hear him downstairs late at night screaming in terror. I remember coming downstairs one night to find out what was going on because I was scared. Mom told me to go back to bed and not to wake my brother because he was having nightmares. I just remember going back to my room feeling very distressed, scared and bewildered. I had no idea what a night terror was.Life as I knew it had forever changedI found myself becoming more fearful of everything and as a child I had no idea that it wasn\u2019t normal to be so fearful of life. I figured everyone had a ton of fears. It wasn\u2019t until I became a teenager that I realized I was different but I wanted to fit in so I would hide my fears. Sometimes my deep fears would surface and my friends would make fun of me. Somehow, I found ways to stifle my fears, I didn\u2019t want to look like a wimp and I longed for others to really like me.I feared death at a very young age. I began working at the hospital at 18 years old and learned I wasn\u2019t invincible after seeing more death and dying. I began to fear that those I loved the most would die and I would hyper focus on death instead of loving life. I even feared I would die young and that fear held me back from doing things that were supposed to be fun. I remember my fiance asking me to go boating and hesitated but went. Once we were in the water I began to freak out and begged him to get us back to shore. He tried to calm me but it didn\u2019t work. I could tell he felt defeated and frustrated with me but he brought us back to shore. He must have really loved me because he continued to date me and we eventually married each other, he also had a great deal of patience and my anxiety disorder(which I wasn\u2019t aware of the actual term at the time) didn\u2019t scare him away. I never realized it but he was similar to my dad in many ways and his love for me had a calming effect when I was unable to be rationale.My dad was my rock and I will never know if the loss of him and not having closure after his death caused my Anxiety Disorder to reel out of control. I will never know if life would have been different for me if he had not died when I was a child.You never fully get over the loss of a loved one. I moved on but after my mother passed away a few years ago, I began thinking of my father again and all the memories we didn\u2019t share after his death. I once again, thought of us as the family we used to be but never got to experience life as a family after I turned 10 years old.I honestly believe that if there isn\u2019t closure after the loss of someone you love, it can affect you in many different ways. I was told by Doctor that it\u2019s been proven many people are born with a gene that makes them predisposed to Anxiety and biological events can set the pattern. I think dad\u2019s death, mom\u2019s fears which did spill over onto each of us and not having closure after I lost my dad set the pattern in motion for my Anxiety Disorder to become full blown as a young adult.Do I blame anyone?No, I don\u2019t blame my mom, she did the best she could with the tools she was given. I feel bad for my mom as well because she didn\u2019t have closure either. She was only 32 years old when dad died and was left alone to raise 5 children 10 years old and younger. I don\u2019t blame anyone but it would be easy considering my teachers were aware of my dad\u2019s cancer before he died and fully aware I lost my dad but never said one word once I returned to class within less of a week of losing him. I blame the era, not the people. That\u2019s just the way life was then, hush\u2026 if you don\u2019t talk about it, well\u2026 it never happened, right?There are many fears I\u2019ve overcome through therapy but I still have a lot of fears that I\u2019m not even aware of to this day that I have to work on. Having Anxiety Disorder is like the weather, it\u2019s unpredictable and you need to have the tools to survive before the weather changes again.This story is just a blurb that began years ago and I can\u2019t blame my entire existence on my dad\u2019s death or my mom\u2019s fears. Mom used to tell us after my father died (many years later) that he suffered from Anxiety attacks and I\u2019m sure he did. But, as I grew much older I also realized my mom suffered from anxiety as well as OCD\u2026 another story for another day.Piecing together your life\u2019s circumstances is harder than a complicated puzzle but it\u2019s vital to your well being to work on that puzzle. Little by little, as you begin to visualize the pieces by putting them together, you find out more about yourself. Blaming is not part of healing, focusing on your well being and being mindful is tantamount to healing.Written byWritten by","6190":"We have all seen the research that proves practicing meditation is good for improving both our mental well-being and our physical health. People of all ages, from school children to seniors, can benefit from daily mindfulness.So why don\u2019t more people meditate? Contrary to what some believe, meditation does not have to be weird, difficult, or take up a lot of your time.I have listed (and debunked) the Top 10 reasons people have given me over my years as a yoga teacher as to why they are not willing to explore meditation.As long as you are keeping your spine straight, you can sit any way you like. You can even sit in a chair if it is difficult for you to get down on the floor. There is no reason to be uncomfortable while meditating. I have even known people who practice meditation while lying down, but I don\u2019t suggest that for beginners because it\u2019s too easy to get sleepy!There are many meditations that require movement, such as walking, eating, and drawing meditations. Some people are really attracted to these movement oriented meditations, while others prefer quieter, more introspective meditations. I encourage you to experiment with different types of meditation so that you can find one that works best for YOU.There are plenty of meditations that require visual attention on a certain object with eyes wide open.As long as what you are wearing is comfortable, you are good to go!A successful meditation can be as short as one conscious breath. Most people will increase the amount of time they practice over time, but even if you only have one spare minute you can have a successful meditation!I put off meditation for years because I could never find a way to turn off all the noise around me. Cars would drive by, the refrigerator would hum, the clock would tick, the neighbor\u2019s dog would start barking, it went on and on. Those are EXCUSES. One of my best meditation sessions happened at a busy bus stop. And you will find out that focusing on sound is one of the easiest ways to \u201csneak\u201d meditation into your life.People tend to think this because we are a goal-oriented society obsessed with end results. Meditation is a PROCESS that may or may not yield the results you expect. Don\u2019t worry about the results, because they change over time anyway. Just put in the effort, and everything else will fall into place. Meditation is one of the easiest things you can do because it\u2019s foolproof. Really!Meditation awakens the natural curiosity we lose as we grow into adulthood and amass real-world problems. When we are curious about something there is little room for boredom because our minds are occupied.You don\u2019t have to! There are many meditation techniques that involve following random thoughts as fast as they appear. An active mind can be a great point of focus, as long as the focus is done as an observer of the thoughts with no intervention or manipulation.I have been in your shoes, and I know how difficult it is to get started. But in this age of knowledge-for-the-masses, it is easier than ever to learn about the benefits and techniques of meditation!Meditation is like any other skill-based practice in that one improves with conscious application. Being curious about the world you live in is an important first step in awakening the mind. And mediation is to the mind what exercise is to the body, so what are you waiting for?***Excerpt from How to Sneak More Meditation Into Your Life: A Doable Meditation Plan for Busy People by K.

It was a tough, heartfelt discussion on how this professional faces the death of patients on a weekly basis, how this affects the professional\u2019s own psyche, and if we could ever win the \u201cwar on cancer\u201d. The societal trauma of this disease is not limited to the patients, but clearly extends to health practitioners.But are the practitioners on the frontline fully armed? Throughout the interview there was no mention of diet, vegetables or fruit, despite the evidence and even rising awareness of the health benefits of a vegan diet. Although there are a spectrum of perspectives, many health professionals and scientists still view food as an idle globule of nutrition incapable of eliciting the precise or potent medicinal benefits attributed to drugs. Even when asked on the prospect of \u201cdefeating cancer\u201d, the interviewee\u2019s discussion on the philosophy of the \u201cwar\u201d analogy replaced the recognition that multiple studies show a lowered risk of the majority of cancers and mortality by cancer is achieved by a plant based diet.There was little chance that this was intentional; the oncologist in question appeared to not be aware of this option. The plethora of sophisticated cancer therapies and drugs continues to increase (as does the research advancing our insights), and perhaps it is this level of intricacy that validates relegating diet as an integrative medicine treatment by medical associations? After all, Dr Caldwell Esselstyn (who healed terminal heart disease patients with a plant diet) noted that his colleagues referred him to as \u201cDr Sprouts\u201d in the documentary \u201cForks Over Knives\u201d.But the pinnacle of nutrition research shows the defined and specific effects of plant foods to combat specific cancers or groups of cancers. Eating blueberries can double the number of Natural Killer cells that circulate the body and kill cancerous cells (1). Sweet potatoes may lower the risk of renal cancer (2). Broccoli reduces DNA damage (a fundamental step in cancer), even amongst smokers (3). Chamomile tea may protect against thyroid cancer (4). Plant fibre detoxifies the kidneys, gut and liver via gut bacteria (removing potential carcinogens that could circulate and cause cancer) (5). Weekly raw garlic intake lowers the risk of oesophageal cancer by 80% (6). Green tea may protect white blood cells from DNA damage (7). The vegan\/\u201cwhole food plant-based\u201d diet itself has been shown to directly lower the risk of developing non-communicable cancers and metabolic syndrome; after 7 days (8,9).All of these are interventions with several defined effects that are increased with increased intake. Diet can be used like acupuncture needles to elicit exact health goals and treatments, and we post these research findings on a regular basis here. But the closest public awareness campaigns get to promoting this information is the 5-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendation. Albeit helpful, patients diagnosed with specific cancers remain predominantly oblivious to the specific foods that could help until they are inspired to make the right Google search. Worse still, many patients understandably negate the benefits of a vegan diet because their doctor may view vegetables mainly as medically inert, amorphous calories with fibre.The \u201cFreakonomics\u201d podcast had a series of episodes in August 2017 on \u201cBad Medicine\u201d, covering what may stagnate progress in healthcare practice. The issues mentioned there are likely to present themselves in many professional fields and is by no means exclusive to the medical field. It is simply not the doctor\u2019s fault, the information on plant diets and cancer is not in their training. Professor T. Colin Campbell also presents a comprehensive discussion on why Medicine is not implementing all that Nutrition has to offer in the book \u201cWhole\u201d (10).However the blame-game is not productive, mainly because living patients can be helped right now. \u201cFrontline practitioners\u201d need to be armed with every tool possible to treat and heal, and so do the patients. Could professional cancer associations fear a fall in public perception if they are perceived to promote a diet synonymous with trendy celebrities and animal rights\/global warming activists? Surely medical professionals can effectively communicate the scientific research behind preventing cancer, which we assume is better than curing cancer?Perhaps the solution unveiled by endless experiments and medical trials appears suspiciously holistic, like some internal \u201cplant food-feng shui\u201d for cancer? Because the whole plant food diet has been validated by the duress of scientific enquiry, we should be able to shed all sub-conscious bias and implement food to be our medicine, \u201cHippocratically\u201d speaking.Disclaimer: If you have medical concerns, please consult your doctor before implementing the opinions in this article.N.

Unlike the cat, my brother intended to punish her, the world, his friends, his family (me) and anyone else he felt had done him wrong.He succeeded.The tsunami wave of heartbreak and hurt that a suicide slams into the lives of those affected is utterly unpredictable. Until a family member or a close friend takes their life, it\u2019s impossible to have empathy for someone dealing with this kind of loss.Peter had been an uber competent climber in Colorado, the author of some six books that he painstakingly developed over years of hiking to remote rock in the South Platte long before anyone else bothered to work that hard to find new routes. He was the quintessential climber: tall, lean, sinewy, determined, focused and talented.He was also slightly mad. While that moniker might apply to many who climb (and do other extreme sports like I do, my hand is up) my brother was in some ways certifiable. At times immensely kind and generous, at others vicious and abusive, he embodied that dichotomy of extremes that marks many who struggle with bipolar disease.Peter had always been rebellious. Sent to military school in his early years due to behavioral problems by a grandfather who had been a colonel in World War I, Peter at first succeeded, then succumbed to drugs. In the late sixties and early seventies the drug culture in Florida had permeated every school, including military academies. By the time he got back home, he was badly hooked on amphetamines. He became a dealer, dropped out of high school and struggled to find work. He became an alcoholic and experimented with every kind of drug.Yet, as is the case for so many dealing with mental illness, Peter was brilliant. Gifted with a high IQ, he was bored in school. A superb artist, talented writer and natural athlete, he had an abundance of abilities and no wherewithal to control his impulses. Drugs addled and abused his brain, and cost him cognitive skills. He was unable to control his rage, which caused him to get into fights with bosses and supervisors. He turned his artistic and problem-solving skills to construction. He became known for fine finishing work, for which he never charged enough to keep his head above financial waters. He didn\u2019t know how to value his competence enough to support himself.Because of the raft of recent shootings, mental illness has been identified as an \u201cenemy\u201d without much thought to what that actually looks like. My big brother was mentally ill, but he didn\u2019t own, nor did he seek to own a gun. The only \u201cgun\u201d Peter owned was the invisible one he held to his own head for most of his life. He felt inadequate, unloved (although he was widely admired and liked), and bitter about how life had treated him. Who knows where such feelings come from? My parents lent or gave him thousands of dollars for nursing school, in which he excelled until he punched a doctor in the mouth over a disagreement. They lent him money to pay for broken down Jeeps and vans that he used to cart people into the high hills when he decided to start a climbing business. They gave him money and moral support when he started a gear business called Rhyno Gear. His creative ideas were sometimes picked up or stolen outright by huge gear manufacturers. He didn\u2019t know how to protect his inventions. He often sewed his own clothing, with hands that crafted the cloth into near-perfect pieces. He was a genius in many ways.He even got into composing music. His drawings of the eagles and the mountains evoked his love of the one place where he found sanity: the high country, where the only noise he heard was the wind as he hung dangling from difficult holds.I perused my big brother\u2019s art collection, listened to his music and admired the many photos of rock antics as we mingled at his wake some six months after Peter\u2019s suicide. His climbing buddies had organized the gathering in Rocky Mountain National Park, a favorite haunt of my brother\u2019s. The one and only time I had ever climbed, it had been in this park with Peter, some forty years prior. One of the few photos I possess of us together shows us at the top of the 5.9 crack, my first, which had torn my hands to shreds.Typical of my brother, he had started me on some near-impossible task, trusting that I had the moxie to get to the top. I did. I didn\u2019t fall in love with climbing. I did fall in love with other extreme sports, which Peter admired. But his love was the rock. It loved him back.Peter\u2019s wake allowed me to learn who my brother had become. Before that wake, my experience of Peter was largely made up of his insistent demands for money I didn\u2019t possess. Stories of his failures and fights. Dropping out of this or that venture. The girlfriends who would call in tears, wanting advice on how to \u201cfix\u201d my big brother. Peter\u2019s draining our aged parents\u2019 bank accounts to pay for concert tickets and trips to go climbing. So much unhappy news.During the wake, I heard tales of my brother\u2019s heroism. He had saved the lives of two people who had gone off a mountain highway into a stream. He pulled both out, did CPR, and attended to their wounds before calling 911. By the time the police and ambulance arrived those people were stable and ready for transporting to the hospital. Just as the ambo came around the corner, my brother melted silently into the forest. Not many know that story. I sure didn\u2019t. It was a revelation.Others spoke of my brother as a father figure, a mentor. Their admiration for a man I hardly knew made me cry. I never knew this guy. I only knew a deeply troubled, perpetually angry man who couldn\u2019t find a way in the world, whose perceptions of it colored his thinking such that he struggled to find a place in society. The women who loved him had their banking and emotional bank accounts drained, but they loved him passionately. If only, they said, if only enough love could fix him. It couldn\u2019t. Peter hated himself.After being estranged from my brother (over money, of course) for decades, I had been isolated from the man my brother had become. Still troubled, in some ways perhaps even more angry, as he aged and parts of his body didn\u2019t support him the way he was accustomed to. Decades of smoking, skin cancer from extreme sun exposure, and the cumulative effects of poor habits which cost him his teeth had a terrible effect on his ego. The last time I saw him, we had a meeting about the family inheritance. The man who walked into the restaurant, barely eighteen months older than I am, looked thirty years older. It was a visual shock. Reading my face, Peter laughed. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d he grinned with that endearing, impish way of his. \u201cThe high country can be rough on your vanity.\u201dThe next time I saw Peter, he was on a slab at the morgue.However, that heartbreak, which can cause you to stand dizzily on the edge of a black hole of grief, inviting you to come on in after your last family member, was greatly assuaged by those who had loved and adored my big brother. Most didn\u2019t know he had a sister. None knew he had a son, who is now in his mid-forties. My brother died not knowing he had a grandson. Or that his son was the spitting image of him.I kicked off the wake by telling tales of my brother\u2019s antics on the farm growing up, I set the tone for celebration. The stories that followed fundamentally rewrote for me the story of my big brother\u2019s life. I drove home from that event transformed, having been given an extraordinary gift: a far greater understanding of the man who was my big bro. Complex, messy, confusing, maddening, yet immensely competent in his own way, influential, gracious, generous. In other words, a whole\u200a\u2014\u200aand messy\u200a\u2014\u200aperson, like everyone else.Peter wasn\u2019t the only one in our family to deal with mental illness. I do too. So does Peter\u2019s son, who, when I tracked him down, was doing time in a California jail for murderous assault. This young man\u2019s son, now in the military, may also be at risk. Who knows if there is a genetic piece. Who cares. What I have learned through my brother\u2019s suicide is that not only do we not really know, we may never know. What I do know is that labeling my big brother -or me, or his son, or anyone else- mentally ill is patently unfair and grotesque. That diagnosis places a person in the jail of public opinion, especially today as we demonize mental illness as the cause of mass shootings. I beg to differ. The broad-brush picture that term paints grossly underestimates the entirety of that person\u2019s life, their gifts, their potential, and the lives they change for the better. Peter\u2019s wake woke me up to the vastness of who my brother was which far outstripped any diagnosis. He was troubled, yes. But he changed, and even saved, many lives.In a world quick to slap easy labels on people as a way to predict behavior, dictating that someone is \u201cmentally ill\u201d provides a panacea for the easily frightened. We want to put folks in handy boxes so that we can \u201cdeal with them.\u201d However, to some degree, we\u2019re all just a little mad. Witness road rage, going postal, running people off the road because we\u2019re in a hurry. What\u2019s normal about that? What\u2019s normal about trolling someone until they also commit suicide like my big brother? Were we all to go through the standardized tests, perhaps most of us would end up with a similar diagnosis, given the stresses of today\u2019s world.Being a little crazy can be a good thing. Sometimes it helps us survive. Sometimes we don\u2019t make it, like my big brother. Yet in his own way, Peter gave me a gift. His suicide, while devastating, eventually caused me to question my own reason for living. As the last member of my immediate family, I have a legacy to leave. I get to honor the live-out-loud way my big brother did on the rocks and crags and ice of the Rocky Mountains. Each time I leap out of an airplane, kayak an icy stream, or stand on top of a mountain, Peter laughs inside my head. I\u2019m slightly mad. You betcha. My friends tell me that all the time. They\u2019re right.You need that to survive this crazy world. That\u2019s not mentally ill. That\u2019s just sucking the marrow out of life. Peter did it until he couldn\u2019t any more. And that\u2019s all right. I no longer know that anyone can define what normal is any more. Given that, who are we to stay who is or isn\u2019t mentally ill in a world where a guy who can\u2019t get a job sets up murderous bombs all over Austin? My brother had a worse diagnosis. But he saved lives.And I have my slightly insane brother to thank in part for the slightly mad but marvelous life I live today. For my money, a little madness is a good thing.Written byWritten by","6255":"Last June we drove out to Colorado to visit my son and his family. I was very nervous about leaving home, that\u2019s what happens when you suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, you fear being out of your comfort zone. Instead of feeling excited like I used to before traveling, the days leading up to leaving left me feeling exhausted, shaky and moody. It was hard to motivate myself to pack our bags, something I used to do without giving it a second thought because I was pumped to get going. I wanted the merry go round in my mind to stop.All the anxious feelings I had prior to leaving left me as soon as we jumped in the car. I suddenly felt free! The sun was shining, I turned up the volume on the radio, my husband and I both purchased lattes for the road and we were off. The highway looked so welcoming and I found myself singing to the music in the car\u2026 as my husband would glance over at me with a grin. No, he wasn\u2019t grinning because I can sing like a rock star, just grinning because I like to sing. We both felt a sense of freedom once we hit the road. I remember thinking to myself, \u201cwhy did you worry so much?\u201d As if I had control over it.We took our time heading out to Colorado. It was a 1600 mile trip one way, so we decided to take our time going down. My husband and I went at our own pace, there was no stress, we were so relaxed. I knew once we arrived at my son\u2019s home that would change, we would be on their families schedule, not mine, or at least the the one I felt I had control over. I tried so hard to focus on all the positives- spending time my grandsons, sitting together as a family because we don\u2019t get to do that often and feeling fortunate to see the beauty of Colorado. The first 3\u20134 days were great!On or about day five I woke up feeling exhausted, I felt as though I was in a deep fog. I was hoping the feeling would leave me once I had my first cup of coffee and showered. Not only did I feel like I was enveloped in fog, I felt as though I was having an out of body experience and panic began to set in. I had medicine with me in case I did have break through anxiety so I took a pill. I began to feel a bit better and we left the hotel to head over to the kids house.I wasn\u2019t getting enough sleep and for what ever reasons when I\u2019m sleep deprived I am much more prone to having a panic attack. When we walked in to the house it felt like everyone\u2019s voices were echoing, I was spinning from the dizziness that overcame me and all I could think was, \u201cDammit, this has to stop, I can\u2019t have a panic attack in front of my grandsons!\u201d I grabbed some water and sat down for a bit. When we all got into the car it seemed that my panic attack had settled down and I was excited about the day, finally. We were headed to Estes Colorado and I was excited.My son parked the car and we all jumped out. I took photos of the river that ran through the town of Estes and I was truly enjoying the scenery. My mind wasn\u2019t on myself, I was mesmerized by the beauty that surrounded us. I felt at peace.Once I was done shooting photos and the kids were done playing on the playground near by we were ready to walk and see more sights. We weren\u2019t even a minute into walking when I suddenly felt extreme nausea, vertigo, my heart began to race, and I thought I was going to pass out. I fell behind everyone and ended up having to sit on a bench because I literally thought I was going to faint. My daughter in law saw me and sat down next to me. She asked if I was Okay? I told her, \u201cI think I\u2019m having a panic attack.\u201d She yelled to the guys to slow down as we sat together on the bench. I remember telling her I need to get some food and something cold to drink. I\u2019m not sure why but when I have a panic attack, a cold 7-Up helps as I sip through a straw.I felt so defeated, embarrassed and ANGRYWhen a panic attack hits you, your mind can\u2019t think clearly. I remember my daughter in law pointing out different places we could stop to eat at while showing me on a map. I think I became a bit belligerent and told her to stop showing me a map because my head was spinning! My thoughts become a bit irrational when I\u2019m in the midst of having a panic attack. Almost as soon as I basically bit her head off I caught myself and tried to pull it together a bit. I apologized to her and began crying hysterically.I cried out of frustration, I cried out of embarrassment and I cried because I didn\u2019t want my grandsons to see me like this, how would I explain this to them?!!My daughter in law went around the corner and bought a soda for me to sip on. I told the kids I needed to eat and I felt a bit queasy but it would pass as soon as we got something to eat. Luckily, as soon as I mentioned food, the boys said they were hungry too. I felt a sense of relief that they had no idea what was going on. There was a nice Mexican Restaurant just across the street from where we were sitting and we headed over. I still felt shaky and dizzy but my husband held my hand and that helped me to feel a sense of calm and more balanced, literally.After we had a nice lunch, the rest of the day was awesome. However, once you\u2019ve had a panic attack and it doesn\u2019t matter how frequent you have them or not, you get pre-anticipatory anxiety when it comes to doing something that is outside of your control (or comfort zone) again. The pre-anticipatory anxiety begins as soon as you plan your next \u2018move.\u2019 Sadly, I had one more major panic attack the day before we left Colorado when we were out on our own with my grandsons, a day that was filled with fun. Again, the boys never knew I had a panic attack but at some point if there isn\u2019t a cure in my lifetime for this disorder, I will have to find a way to tell them what I suffer from when they grow old enough to understand. It\u2019s very hard to hide a panic attack.I practice meditation and mindfulness but this is not a cure for Anxiety Disorder or Panic attacks. If it were that simple, no one would be suffering from Anxiety and\/or Panic Disorder. I\u2019m very thankful that I have a family who loves me unconditionally and seems to understand that this is a real illness. Not everyone is that lucky, there are many people who suffer and their loved ones get angry with them, tell them to suck it up or just don\u2019t seem to care enough to become better educated because too many people still view this form of Mental Illness as a weakness.If you know of someone or have a loved one who suffers from Anxiety Disorder, please take it seriously. If you don\u2019t want to read up on it- go to a few Doctor appointments with your loved one to get a better understanding of this illness, it will also empower YOU. Those of us that suffer from Anxiety Disorder understand that it takes a toll on those who love us. If you are a friend, don\u2019t walk away, ask questions and let your friend know you are there for them. People who suffer from anxiety disorder can go long periods of time without having a panic attack and they also have big hearts\u2026 they will go out of their way to be there for you when you need them as well.You can\u2019t control Anxiety or a Panic attack anymore than you can control the tides of the Ocean.Sometimes you just need to learn to ride the waves and try to remember they stop at the shore.Written byWritten by","6420":"Are Brazil Nuts a Natural Health-Resource?One of the broadest causes and contributors to many diseases is the process of inflammation. Inflammation is a coordinated response by the body to destroy damaged cells, pathogens or toxins, but this process can often cause collateral damage to the body. Further complications come when something we are allergic to, our diet, or even chronic diseases (like AIDS) trigger this collateral damage in a periodic or continual manner. Where do brazil nuts fit in here?\u2026Eating 1 brazil nut a day halved multiple inflammation indicators of kidney dialysis patients; after 3 months (1)! Inflammation dictates how chronic kidney disease develops, and inflammation even contributes to diabetes progression (2), so such a simple intervention is extremely profound. Moreover the natural systems to offset inflammatory damage were increased and activated (i.e. the antioxidant systems). Similar results were observed before (3), showing that this effect of brazil nuts is reproducible. So what\u2019s so special about brazil nuts?Brazil nuts are the richest known food source of the element selenium (Se), and should probably be classified as a natural resource. Eating 2 brazil nuts daily has been shown to deliver selenium (Se) into the bloodstream (4). Interestingly, the brazil nuts in this study were slightly more effective than a supplement form of Se in activating the body\u2019s circulating antioxidant power of \u201cglutathione peroxidase\u201d (GPx), even though the supplement contained slightly more Se (4)!Brazil nuts are not just edible Se capsules from nature, but because there is so much medical significance around Se supplementation (5) and we know brazil nuts raise Se levels (4), brazil nuts remain a largely under-utilised medicinal resource. A real problem with inflammatory damage is excess oxidation; a process similar to the mechanism that makes apples, bananas and avocados go brown. Brazil nuts are potent against inflammation because they activate our anti-oxidant systems with Se. As such the following effects of Se supplements could be provided by eating brazil nuts, possibly more effectively.Se supplements have been repeatedly shown to improve the outcomes of AIDS patients; the amount of HIV (virus) in the bloodstream was decreased and the white blood cells that are usually lowered during disease actually increased in number (6, 7). When analysed further, the body\u2019s own antioxidant system \u201cthioredoxin 1\u201d (TR1) is empowered to interfere with and reduce the HIV virus\u2019s ability to multiply (8). Brazil nuts have not directly been tested for their effect on AIDS progression, but based on their effectiveness as a \u201cnatural Se supplement\u201d there may be scope.As detailed previously in the article \u201cWhat a Vegan Diet Could Do for Your Gut Microbes\u201d, bad gut microbes are \u201cbad\u201d mainly because they cause inflammation in the gut (9). Not so surprisingly, Se supplementation boosts good gut microbe numbers, increases the diversity of gut microbes, lowers inflammation and improves gut health (10, 11). Once again, data has not yet been produced on the direct effect of brazil nuts on human gut microbes, but the brazil nut-Se link may be a conduit for remedy in this area as well.The medicinal potential of brazil nuts even extends to cancer. The risk of prostate cancer is lowered by around 50% in men who took Se supplements (12). Moreover, observations on the effectiveness of Se supplements in treating or preventing skin (13), gastric, oesophageal and other cancers (14) were confirmed when brazil nuts were tested directly on gene expression. Healthy people considered \u201cat-risk\u201d for colorectal cancer were not given Se supplements this time but 6 brazil nuts daily, and experienced healthy changes in multiple indicators for colorectal cancer after 6 weeks (15). Brazil nuts may protect against colorectal cancer, and several other cancers(!)As discussed previously, it is possible that simpler dietary recommendations are being bypassed for the increasing number of sophisticated interventions currently in use for treating the diseases listed above. In all fairness, the current strategies wouldn\u2019t be employed if they were not saving lives. Also, there may be an increasing trend of a few practising doctors prescribing food for chronic diseases. But if health is wealth, brazil nuts may be a tasty, undervalued commodity with the untapped potential to prevent and treat several of humanity\u2019s inflammatory diseases.Please note: high antioxidant intake in the form of plant foods is associated with reduced risk of death by lymphoma [16], respiratory diseases [17] and risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease [18], alongside other benefits [17, 19].Disclaimer: If you have medical concerns, please consult your doctor before implementing the opinions in this article.N.

Sometimes it\u2019s with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper added, occasionally it\u2019s lemon\/lime for added tartness, and every once in a while you\u2019ll see some mint or stevia thrown in for good measure. But it always comes down to a simple recipe: warm water with a bit of lemon juice, downed at least once a day with a cheerful smile.And apparently, this juice works wonders on the body.The benefits claimed for this \u2018simple wellness trick\u2019 are truly astonishing. Here is a short list from my 10 minutes of Googling:I could go on. The number of claimed benefits is truly astonishing \u2014 if this was all true, we could close down hospitals, fire the doctors, and just gulp liters of lemon water to live forever illness-free.Of course, it is almost all nonsense.Lemon water does nothing for your health at all.Most of these claims come from a few common sources. The first big one is that our bodies are too acidic, and that in order to achieve optimal health, you have to neutralize this with supposedly \u2018alkaline\u2019 foods.Now, lemons are acidic, but when you drink lemon water, because of a few interesting chemical interactions, your urine becomes less acidic. And so, the idea is that by drinking lemon water you are going to de-acidify your body and make yourself healthier.This is pure nonsense.Your body exists on a very fragile continuum when it comes to acidity. If your blood gets a tiny bit more acidic, you aren\u2019t just a tad unwell: you\u2019re in a coma, or dead. People with diabetes have to watch out for this, because high blood sugar can cause you to have acidic blood, which then leads to, well, death.Your body has amazing systems in place to prevent you from having too much acidity or alkalinity. One of the things it does is get rid of the excess. Sometimes, that\u2019s in your urine.So all these \u2018health benefits\u2019 are basically a misunderstanding of how pee works.This also leads to some of the other bogus health claims, because the idea that lemon water can do anything about cancer\/bacteria\/viruses\/inflammation is based on the idea that you need to alkalize your body. The idea is that these issues are caused by an acid environment \u2014 cancer can only grow in \u2018acidic conditions\u2019, bacteria thrive in highly acidic environments, and on and on.This is, again, total nonsense.Cancer growth has nothing to do with the acidity, and bacteria and viruses are happy to grow in any place that you can too \u2014 if your cells could get alkaline enough to deter a bacteria, you\u2019d be long dead.There are also a lot of claims related to the antioxidants contained in lemons. The funny thing about antioxidants is that a) there\u2019s no evidence taking additional antioxidants can improve your health and b) you\u2019re probably getting a bunch of them in your diet anyway. Unless you\u2019re seriously malnourished, it\u2019s unlikely that you need the additional micronutrient (i.e. vitamin) benefit that lemon water might give you.As for the other claims? There is certainly evidence that lemon water will make your food more acidic, but aside from that there\u2019s no real science behind anything you\u2019ll read. If you take a look on Pubmed or Google scholar, you see a few tiny studies looking at lemon water, but most of them find little to no real benefits, or they are so small that drawing any conclusions from them is impossible. The biggest one I could find after an hour of searching looked at just 78 people, which is on the very low end of acceptable in this kind of clinical trial. Most of the studies looked at less than 30 people, and were often of very poor quality, making it hard to draw any conclusions about them at all.So what does this mean for you?Well, firstly, don\u2019t read wellness blogs. If you aren\u2019t suffering from a chronic disease, you\u2019re probably plenty well already. If you\u2019re worried that you might have a chronic disease, go and talk to your doctor, because unlike wellness bloggers they do years of medical school and training before they can diagnose and treat people.And as for our miracle cure?Lemon water is a total waste of time.Drink it if you like the taste. Hell, drink it if it makes you feel better about yourself: at the end of the day, it\u2019s just slightly bitter water.Just don\u2019t expect any health benefits from it.There\u2019s no evidence that lemon water will improve your health at all.If you enjoyed, follow me on Medium, Twitter or Facebook!If you\u2019re interested in common health food fads and why they probably won\u2019t save your life, check out these other articles:You can now get your dose of Health Nerding on the Sensationalist Science podcast.

Instead, I continued to teach, trying to find loopholes to have a reprieve in order to mentally and physically recuperate. I continued the fight day after day, year after year, always hoping things would get better.\u201cTeachers who do an excellent job are often working in unsustainable conditions (e.g., 60 hours per week, relentless stress, inadequate resources, lack of support or time, etc.) (Herman, 2014).\u201dI needed time to take care of myself and my family. Teaching wasn\u2019t allowing that.There are other paths I am pursuing, but I also need to get a paycheck in order for my family to keep our house. Any paycheck isn\u2019t acceptable at this point in my life, though; I no longer want to risk my mental health. If something is in my control to improve my mental health\u2026or prevent a mental downturn\u2026I need to take it. That definitely is choosing how I earn a paycheck.I met a lovely lady at a Mardi Gras brunch this year. After visiting briefly, I learned that she and her husband were opening a coffee shop not far from where I live. It wasn\u2019t until this past week, though, when I learned of a particular position they were needing to fill that I jumped at the opportunity. You see, I\u2019m a morning person\u2026the only one in my little family. This position doesn\u2019t include working weekends, and my eight-hour day ends at 1:00pm.There\u2019s still enough hours to make doctor appointments and run errands while offices are still open\u2026no need to take a day off to get things done.I also get to go home\u2026and spend my time the way I want to (which does not include grading essays, writing lessons, catching up on paperwork and parent contact, etc.)It\u2019s my time. I can be a mom and wife and writer and dream-maker.I get to wear jeans every single day. If you\u2019ve ever been a teacher, you know just how golden this is.Hell, yes. The connections I\u2019ve made with them have been tremendously important in my life. Continuing to work with teens in some capacity is equally important\u2026which is why I\u2019m in the process of launching an online platform for teens\u2019 writing regarding issues they face in today\u2019s world.For now, I will be one of the \u201cshiny happy people\u201d who greet you with a smile and help you start your day with the perfect cuppa joe.Perhaps one day I\u2019ll even be able to make a cup for self-proclaimed coffee snob Jeff Goins.As he\u2019s said before, \u201cEver since a semester in Spain, I\u2019ve had a lustful love affair with that dark drink.\u201dHe also says, \u201cCoffee has incredible powers. It has the ability to jumpstart our day and spark amazing conversations with people. In fact\u2026there is more superpower in a coffee mug than meets the eye.\u201dSo, as I pursue my passions and side hustles (with the assistance of Jeff and tribe), I will also be helping others pursue theirs by starting their day with coffee and a smile.\u2192UPDATE: As of August 7th, I am now a full-time freelancer!

I listened as best I could. And then she really caught my attention.\u201cI\u2019ve been sharing your poetry with Karen. She\u2019s been homebound for quite a while and depressed, so I thought it might lift her spirits.\u201dKaren would ask me each day, \u201cWould you share another poem from your friend, Anne?\u201dListening to Cori\u2019s words, I felt warm inside. Glad this woman found comfort in my words. But I could tell Cori was weighted down by this women\u2019s story.\u201cAnne, a couple nights ago, while reading, Karen asked me if I could read slower. Without a computer, her only contact with people was the telephone. She recently lost her roommate to cancer. She asked me if I could find a pastor who would come and visit her. So I tried.\u201dI felt for this woman I didn\u2019t know. Surely Cori would be able to find someone. She said she had called 32 churches. Sharing Karen\u2019s story with each one, she hoped to get a response. Some had told her,\u201cJust have her go to our website.\u201d\u201c32 churches?\u201d I asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Cori continued. \u201cAnd I told them it didn\u2019t have to be the pastor who went. But if they were leery about going to a stranger\u2019s house, maybe a couple of women could go together.\u201dI pictured this woman needing help. Something easy to picture because of my own cousin, Pattie. I thought back to the phone call years ago from my brother, George.\u201cAnne, Pattie needs her social security paperwork and she can\u2019t find it. I went over to help and I was shocked by what I saw.\u201dGeorge had my full attention.\u201cThere were piles of stuff everywhere, things piled up four feet. In fact, you could only walk from room to room through a tiny path. I had no idea she was living like that.\u201dI felt sick to my stomach as I listened. This was Pattie. The person who meant so much to us. Why didn\u2019t she tell us?It was Pattie who got me and my sister our first Barbie dolls. Pattie, who taught us how to do the \u201c twist.\u201d And Pattie, who bought my first electric shaver. She heard my embarassment about the little hairs growing on my legs.And the day we buried our mom, Dad had left us alone as he went to his sister\u2019s house. Pattie came right over and walked us around the block letting us talk and cry. Her heart was broken too because she loved our mom so much.I would have done anything for Pattie.When I walked into her condo, I stood there, overwhelmed. The piles of stuff everywhere, the darkness, the odors. How would I ever get it done?I knew my brother would not be able to help because of his back, so my daughter and I made the hour-long trip to Pattie\u2019s condo, and we started the huge task. It was obvious Pattie could not live on her own. Not anymore.Pattie had lost her mom to suicide. Her dad had died years later, the day before he was to retire. Pattie became depressed. Then losing her job deepened her feelings of sadness. I just wish she would have told us.She turned to things to give her a sense of comfort. Things don\u2019t have feelings, and more importantly, things don\u2019t die on you.I looked around at all her stuff. The very things she once loved were the ones that were now suffocating her.Week after week, Jessie and I would go to Pattie\u2019s condo and work for hours. Sometimes we carried as many as 10 black garbage bags out to the dumpster.And then I found the needed paperwork. I was so glad, but I knew we were far from being done.One day while visiting Pattie at the nursing home she said,\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t throw out any of my matchbooks. I collect those.\u201dI let the comment go in one ear and out the other. And I treated her things with respect because I respected her.I found cards with money inside, unopened mail. I found bags of groceries she had brought in the house and just left sitting there. There were boxes and boxes of unopened treasures from the home shopping network.It was one of the hardest jobs I\u2019ve ever done. The garbage that was everywhere, the smell from the fridge. I just powered through. And why? Because I loved her.I actually discovered a whole dining room set under all the piles of stuff.Yes, Karen sounded a lot like our Pattie, who we lost to cancer less than a year after we finished her condo. Both women were lonely and broken.Once again Cori continued, \u201cAnne, I got a call from the woman who lives Karen\u2019s building. She helps her out by taking out Karen\u2019s trash.\u201dAnd then Cori got quiet, \u201cAnne, Karen attempted suicide.\u201dI sat there stunned. Was she serious?The woman, who found Karen asked Cori, \u201cDo you know an Anne Peterson? On her wall, was a handwritten poem tacked up with Anne Peterson\u2019s name on it.\u201dSo that\u2019s why Cori was asked to slow down.A dark cloud hung over us. I was filled with an unexplainable sadness for this woman I had never met, and was just getting to hear about.Cori called again the next day.\u201cAnne, I found out which poem it was. Karen told me she loved wings. She thought of them as angel wings.\u201dI hurt for how Karen must have felt, having lost her friend, her own health and hope.Cori said, \u201cMaybe I could have done more.\u201d\u201cYou tried, Cori,\u201d I assured her. \u201cYou called all those churches. You tried.\u201dGod answered Karen\u2019s prayers. The day the woman stopped by Karen\u2019s house was not her normal day to stop in. It was God who prompted her to go, which ultimately saved her life.God says he\u2019s near the broken hearted. This certainly was proof he is.And then Cori called excited. \u201cI talked to Karen after she got out of ICU. And guess what? Remember those churches I called, Anne, and nobody responded? One of them contacted me and went and visited her.\u201dOne thing that struck me was how God uses others to reach out to those who call on him. People need to be aware of this.A phone callIn this technological age, people mistakenly presume everyone is connected to the computer. This is not true. Phone calls convey what text messages cannot.A visitVisits don\u2019t have to be long, just a few minutes can bring hope to those who are alone.A mealBringing even a sandwich can lift the spirits of those who are unable to do things for themselves.A flowerPeople who are homebound don\u2019t get out to see the world around them. A flower is bringing the world to them.A cardNo one does snail mail any longer. And yet, it\u2019s a way to reach those who do not have a computer.A giftIt doesn\u2019t take long to find out what a person is interested in. A magazine, a book, or something for their wall would mean so much to them.Offer to do an errandThe smallest job could be monumental to the person with little strength. And yet, if that job were done it would bring so much joy.Cookies Cookies mean love.Thinking of one of my poems handwritten and tacked on Karen\u2019s wall makes me stop and realize how our words can touch others. Written words, spoken words. We need to choose them carefully.There are lonely people everywhere. Do you know a Karen or Pattie in your life? Look around, you just may see one.Written byWritten by","6650":"Here\u2019s a startling truth. I can make you fat. Actually, I can make anybody fat. How? I simply prescribe insulin injections. Giving people extra insulin leads inevitably to weight gain. In type 1 diabetes, when insulin levels are extremely low, patients lose weight no matter how many calories they eat. Give insulin \u2014 gain weight. No insulin \u2014 lose weight (even to the point of death). The implication is clear. Insulin causes weight gain. Knowing this is crucial, because if insulin causes weight gain, then losing weight depends upon lowering insulin. But instead, we\u2019ve been told to focus obsessively on calories.The standard (failed) weight loss advice is to restrict a few calories every day by reducing dietary fat and eating multiple times per day. This does not lower insulin much since dietary fat has little insulin effect and eating frequently constantly stimulates insulin secretion. This \u2018caloric reduction as primary\u2019 advice has an estimated failure rate of 99.5%. So, if you have tried calorie restrictionto lose weight and failed, understand this. You wereexpected tofail.So here\u2019s the situation. \u2018The Man\u2019 tells you that obesity is a caloric balance and that you should eat less and move more. \u2018The Man\u2019 tells you to eat a low fat diet, and to eat 10 times a day. This advice fails virtually everybody. When you fail, \u2018The Man\u2019 tells you it\u2019s your own damned fault for being such a lazy assed, floppy willed person. Hisadvice was good, \u2018The Man\u2019 tells you. You were just a failure. That\u2019s what \u2018The Man\u2019 wants you to believe.Imagine, though we have a classroom of 100 pupils. One fails. It\u2019s likely his fault. Maybe he played too many video games. But if 99 students fails, then it\u2019s not a problem with the students. The problem is with the teacher. In obesity, the problem of rampant obesity means that it is very obviously not the fault of the people. The fault lies with the official dietary advice.Understanding that obesity is a hormonal disorder, not a caloric imbalance (as discussed in our last post) means that we must instead focus on the insulin effect rather than the number of calories to successfully lose weight. Reducing insulin depends mostly upon 2 things:We often think and talk about the first problem, but both are equally important in lowering insulin levels.What to eatThe three different macronutrients stimulate insulin to different degrees. Carbohydrates, particularly refined carbohydrates raise insulin the most. Protein also raises insulin significantly, although blood glucose remains stable. Animal proteins stimulate more insulin release compared to plant proteins. Dietary fat raises neither glucose nor insulin.Most natural foods contain varying combinations of the three macronutrients and therefore raise insulin to varying degrees. For example, refined carbohydrate rich foods like cookies have the greatest effect on raising insulin and glucose. Fat rich foods like salmon have little effect on insulin. This differing ability to stimulate insulin means that foods also differ in their fattening effect. This is only common sense. 100 calories of cookies, is far more fattening than 100 calories of salmon, despite what all the obesity \u2018experts\u2019 claim.The overlap between calories and insulin effect is what causes the confusion between the hormonal (insulin) hypothesis of obesity and the caloric hypothesis of obesity. Many people say that \u2018A calorie is a calorie\u2019, which is, of course, true. But that\u2019s not the question I asked. The question is \u2018Are all calories equally fattening\u2019? To which the answer is an emphatic no. Insulin stimulating foods like glucose are more fattening than non-insulin stimulating foods like kale, even if you have the same number of calories.Certain factors increase insulin which encourages weight gain. The most important factors raising insulin are refined carbohydrates, animal proteins, and insulin resistance. Fructose, from added sugar and fruits can directly cause fatty liver and insulin resistance. This leads the body to increase insulin secretion to compensate.Other factors decrease insulin, protecting against weight gain. Acids found in fermented foods (sauerkraut, kimchee) and vinegar lowers the insulin effect of foods. Animal protein causes secretion of incretin hormones that slows absorption of foods thus lowering insulin. Thus meat has both pro- and anti- insulin effects.Fibre also has this same effect of slowing absorption and insulin effect.Thus, the main principles for lowering insulin and losing weight would include the following, as detailed in The Obesity Code.Rules for \u2018What to Eat\u2019Funny. That\u2019s precisely the sort of no-nonsense advice your grandmother would have given.When to eatThe second and equally important part of lowering insulin is understanding the question of \u2018when to eat\u2019. All foods can raise insulin, which leads to obesity. But there is another important contributor to high insulin levels outside of food \u2014 insulin resistance. This refers to the situation where normal insulin levels are unable to force the blood glucose into the cells. In response, the body raises insulin in a knee-jerk reaction to \u2018overcome\u2019 this resistance, and these high levels will drive obesity. But how did insulin resistance develop in the first place?Our body follows the biologic principle of homeostasis. If exposed to any prolonged stimulus, the body quickly develops resistance. A baby can sleep soundly in a crowded restaurant because the noise is constant, and the baby has become noise \u2018resistant\u2019. But that same baby, in a quiet house, will wake instantly at the slightest creak of the floorboards. Since it has been quiet, the baby has no \u2018resistance\u2019 against noises and thus awakens quickly.If you listen to loud music constantly, you will become slightly deaf. This \u2018resistance\u2019 to loud noises protects the ear from damage. Raising the volume to \u2018overcome\u2019 this resistance works but only temporarily. Volume increases and you become progressively more deaf (resistant to loud noise), which leads you to raise the volume again. The solution is not to keep raising the volume, but to shut it off.Think about the story of the boy who cries wolf. Raising the alarm constantly may work at first but eventually leads to the villagers becoming resistant to the signal. The more the boy cries, the less effect it has. The solution is to stop crying wolf.Insulin resistance is simply a reaction to too much insulin. The body compensates by raising insulin, but that only makes things worse because higher insulin levels lead to more resistance. This is a vicious cycle.The end result is higher and higher insulin levels, which then drives weight gain and obesity. Therefore, a high insulin level depends on 2 things.Providing extended periods of low insulin levels can prevent the development of insulin resistance. How to provide those low levels? A daily period of fasting.This may sound strange, but this is the way we used to eat. Suppose you eat breakfast at 8 am and dinner at 6 pm. You eat for 10 hours of the day and fast for 14 hours. This happens every single day, and the reason we use the word \u2018break-fast\u2019. This is the meal that breaks our fast implying that fasting is simply a part of everyday life. The body spends roughly equal portions of every day in the fed (insulin high, storing fat) and the fasted state (insulin low, burning fat). Because of this nice balance, weight tends to stay stable over time. Up until the 1980s, this was pretty standard practice and obesity was not a big issue.Somehow, we moved away from this traditional way of eating and now eat constantly. We are hounded to eat something the minute we get out of bed in the morning whether we are hungry or not, believing that eating white bread and jam is better than eating nothing at all. We are pestered to eat throughout the day and not stop until it is time for bed. Large surveys show that most Americans eat 6\u201310 times per day. Now our body spends the majority of time in the fed state, and we wonder why we can\u2019t lose weight.Eating constantly does not provide the critical period of very low insulin to balance the high insulin periods. Persistently high insulin leads to insulin resistance, which leads only to higher insulin. This is the vicious cycle of weight gain that we must break with fasting.For the boy who cried wolf, which is the better strategy? Stop crying wolf for a month, and then cry loudly once, or cry wolf constantly, but a little more softly? Similarly, to start burning body fat, you must allow prolonged periods of time of low insulin.Rules for \u2018When to Eat\u2019We often obsess about the foods we should or should not eat, the question of \u2018what to eat\u2019. But we often ignore the equally important question of \u2018when to eat\u2019. By attacking the insulin problem on both fronts, we have a far higher chance of successfully losing weight.Written byWritten by","6655":"Today while cooking breakfast, I saw a magazine on my kitchen island open to this ad.This ad represents everything that is wrong with America. This ad\u2019s message is this:When you overeat, your body is damaged by heartburn. Heartburn causes pain as a warning message. Nexium allows you to ignore this message and continue damaging yourself by engorging on pizza endlessly.That\u2019s what healthcare is like in America. When our health deteriorates, we don\u2019t address the causes of our problems (like our sedentary, unhealthy lifestyles). We go to the pharmacy, where doctors prescribe and dispense pills that allow us to ignore it.Example #1: Two years ago, my mother had shoulder pain. She went to the doctor. The doctor prescribed her an anti-inflammatory pill and tried to send her on her way. When my mother asked \u201cWhat about physical therapy? As a long-term solution?\u201d the doctor balked.Example #2: When Americans are diagnosed with heart disease (which is extraordinarily common), the first line treatment is medication. Second and third line treatments involve surgical intervention. But instead of artificial intervention through medication and surgery, reversing heart disease might be as simple as being vegan. But in America, we don\u2019t talk about that.Example #3: One in six Americans take psychiatric medicine. I find it difficult to believe a solid 16% of Americans (54 million) have mental health problems so intractable that they require medication. Exercise is a very effective treatment for anxiety and depression, but 80% of Americans don\u2019t get their recommended amount of exercise. Typical \u2014 we skip right over the lifestyle change and head straight for the pills.Instead of working with and listening to our bodies, we plow right on by them. We beat our bodies like rented mules, and then when they start to break down from strain, we pump them full of drugs and beat them some more.This isn\u2019t to shame people who are fat, disabled, in poor health, etc. A lot of people in America are victims of a larger medical system which kicks them around like a soccer ball. I was one of them.A few years ago, I ran into some digestive and mental health trouble. Wanting to get better, I took the pills the doctor prescribed. But the pills didn\u2019t address the underlying issues. I watched as my health spiraled down and my prescriptions got larger and larger to address it.The reason I am not still trapped in that system today is cannabis. Cannabis did what all my prescriptions did not, and gave me the ability to make the lifestyle changes I needed to make. First I was able to eat again, something my gut problems took from me. It evened out my moods, enabling me to get off of the dangerous and addictive psychiatric medication my doctor put me on. One year later, I was off all my regular medication. Two years later, I am barely smoking any cannabis (for medical purposes, at least).This isn\u2019t meant to be a plug for cannabis. What I\u2019m getting at is that my prescriptions did nothing but attempt to manage symptoms. Once I found a way to make the right dietary and lifestyle changes, my condition started to improve.Almost every day, I meet someone with chronic health problems. They can list a string of medications as long as their arm that they have tried. But the moment you ask them about lifestyle changes (\u201chave you tried exercise?\u201d \u201cHave you tried being gluten-free (for digestive problems)?\u201d) I get the fish eye.I can\u2019t blame them. When they ask their doctors about these things, their doctors hand-wave. Their doctors are typically family practitioners who spend most of their time doing physicals for high school athletes and prescribing antibiotics for sinus infections. They don\u2019t have time to research the latest lifestyle interventions for Irritable Bowel Syndrome. So, they defer to what they learned in their medical degree several years ago and hand-wave the concerns away.This is why homeopathic medicine has a strong and growing following. It isn\u2019t because Americans have suddenly come over with an anti-science fever. It\u2019s because our doctors and our medical system aren\u2019t spending enough energy researching these things.Yes, a lot of homeopathic medicine is complete nonsense. But I\u2019d rather try 50 homeopathic remedies to find the one that reverses my gut damage than spend my entire life on pills attempting to manage the symptoms. It would be great if the healthcare system researched for me, so I didn\u2019t have to, but they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s left up to me.So, to other chronically ill people: I urge you to look outside the pills which manage your symptoms. Try wacky diets or odd lifestyle interventions. Most of them are going to be crap, but one or two of them aren\u2019t.To everyone at large: Take care of your bodies. Listen to what they tell you. If you feel yourself getting sick or tired, don\u2019t cram your body full of drugs, listen to it. Give it what it needs.To the medical establishment: Stop stuffing us full of pills that make our symptoms go away and get us out of your offices.

Holstein\u2019s blog.Written byWritten by","6676":"The thought of the next day was like a cold breeze. The type of cold that made you hot on the inside. My brain forced thoughts out, but to only go through the hot path of my negative thoughts first.And then to the outskirts of my own two eyes. My mind corrupt from the sadness that each day brings, but having a small batch of freedom every full moon.The mask I wore to keep the black juice out. I drowned within myself, gasping for air each day.I missed parts of enjoyment of my childhood. Running out of each path from searching for myself, to only get torn down even more. I was in my own head a lot, but at the same time I wasn\u2019t.My head felt as if it was empty, but it was filled with the ill thoughts. For as long as I remember this was an everyday thing. My mouth sealed with fear, my throat dry from keeping shut.The opinions of others dug deep into my skull.Eating away piece by piece, making me stumble like a drunk man. My mind became more and more corrupt and filled with pain. It felt like a ticking time bomb.I fought to find myself in other souls, but those souls were lost. Ups and downs, my hands sore from the climb. I started falling, and before the trigger finger and the knife to make its way in, I looked deep within myself and it all made sense.Depression is something that isn\u2019t talked about enough in the world. There are too many things in its place. The suicide rate is going up and all we can do is \u201dpay our respects\u201d and have \u201dhope\u201d.Hoping it will get better won\u2019t solve anything. That\u2019s why I am putting my all into this. Kids should be brought up and taught how to handle things at a young age.In my generation, depression is a normal thing. There are more unhappy people than happy people.This topic should be at the forefront of everything. Living a happy life shouldn\u2019t be an option.Speak up will encourage people to speak up about their problems, because when things build up it could get ugly. We aren\u2019t trained to handle our emotions so ending it all is something people go to first.When we let things build and build our minds get weaker and weaker. Our hearts become brittle, and because of this, we want the pain to stop. And that\u2019s why we choose suicide.I want my campaign to touch as many people as it can. I want to help people out of the dark holes that anxiety and depression can bring, because I\u2019ve been there.Follow me as I put speak up on the map and bring awareness to this topic!Written byWritten by","6738":"Normal DigestionAll foods are composed of a combination of three major components, called macronutrients:Each of these macronutrients are composed of smaller functional units. Carbohydrates are chains of glucose and other sugars. Proteins are chains of amino acids. Fats (triglycerides) are chains of fatty acids. There are also smaller, microscopic amounts of vitamins (A, B, C, D, E, K etc.) and minerals (iron, copper, selenium etc.), known as micronutrients.Digestion breaks down macronutrients for absorption into the bloodstream. This provides both energy (calories) and the raw materials needed (proteins, fats) to build cells. Certain macronutrients must be obtained from our diet because we cannot make them ourselves. There are called essential amino acids (such as arginine and leucine) and essential fatty acids (such as omega 3 and omega 6 fats), but there are no essential carbohydrates. Without these essential nutrients, we would get sick.Each of the three macronutrients is metabolized differently. Carbohydrates, chains of sugars such as glucose and fructose are broken into individual sugars for absorption. Refined carbohydrates (eg. flour) are absorbed much more quickly into the blood stream than unrefined carbohydrates that may still contain significant amounts of proteins, fats and fibre.Digestion breaks dietary proteins into its component parts, called amino acids. These are circulated to the liver, where they are used to repairing and rebuilding cellular proteins. The first job of these amino acids is NOT for use as energy. These are used to build proteins like blood cells, bone, muscle, connective tissue, skin etc. However, if you eat excessive protein, the body has no way to store these extra amino acids. Instead, these are changed into glucose by the liver. An estimated 50\u201370% of the protein ingested is turned into glucosein an average North American person.Fat is composed of molecules called triglycerides. Digestion of fat requires bile which mixes and emulsifies the dietary fat so that it is more easily absorbed into the body. The fat is absorbed directly into the lymphatic system which then empties into the bloodstream. The triglycerides are taken up by the fat cells (adipocytes). Since dietary fat does not require the liver for initial processing, it does not require insulin as a signalling hormone. Thus, dietary fat has almost no effect on insulin levels. Dietary fat is absorbed more or less directly into our body fat directly.Storage of Food EnergyThe body has two complementary methods of energy storage. It can store energy as:When you eat carbohydrates or proteins (in excess of body needs), insulin rises. All the cells of the body (liver, kidney, brain, heart, muscles etc.) help themselves to this all-you-can-eat glucose buffet. If some glucose is left over, it must be stored away. Individual glucose molecules are strung together into long chains called glycogen. This is a relatively simple process. The reverse process, breaking glycogen back into individual component glucose to provide energy when we are not eating (fasting) is also quite easy.Glycogen is both made and stored directly in the liver. When insulin goes up, the body stores food energy as glycogen. When insulin falls, as with fasting, the body breaks glycogen back down into glucose. Liver glycogen lasts approximately 24 hours without eating. Glycogen can only be used to store food energy from carbohydrates and proteins, not dietary fat, which is not processed in the liver, and does not break down into glucose.When glycogen stores are full, the body uses a second form of energy storage \u2014 body fat. Dietary fat and body fat are both composed of molecules called triglycerides. When we eat dietary fat, it is absorbed and sent directly into the bloodstream to be taken up by the adipocytes. The excess liver glucose that cannot be put into the full glycogen storage must be changed into triglycerides through a process called \u2018de novo lipogenesis\u2019.The liver creates new fat from this pool of excess glucose, but cannot store it. Fat should be stored in fat cells, not the liver. So, the liver exports out the fat as very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), which carries it to the adipocyte for long term storage. The liver essentially transforms excess glucose into fat and transport it to the adipocytes for long term storage. This is a much more laborious process than glycogen storage. The advantage of using body fat as storage of food energy is that there is no limit as to how much can be stored.These two different systems for storing food energy complement each other nicely. Glycogen is easy and convenient, but limited in storage space. Body fat is harder and inconvenient, but unlimited in storage space.Think of glycogen like a wallet. Cash is easily available, but there is limited storage space. Think of body fat like money in your bank. It is far more difficult to move money back and forth, but there is an unlimited amount of storage space. For regular daily activities, it is simpler to use your wallet. It is the better short-term solution. In the long term, however, we use a bank to hold your life\u2019s savings.The Fasted StateIn the fasted state, when you don\u2019t eat, insulin levels fall since food is the main stimulus to insulin. While the word fasting may sound scary, it only refers to any time you are not eating. It is the flip side or \u2018B\u2019 side of eating. You are either eating or fasting. When you sleep, for example, you are fasting. The word breakfast refers to the meal that breaks our fast, indicating that fasting is truly a part of everyday life. Our bodies only exist in one of two states \u2014 the fed state (insulin high) or the fasted state (insulin low). Our body is either storing food energy, or it is using it up. In the fasted state, we must rely on our stores of food energy to survive.High insulin tells our body to store energy. Low insulin signals our body to use the stored food energy, because no food in coming in. First, we break glycogen down into glucose for energy. This lasts approximately 24 hours. If we go longer without food, we will need to use the harder-to-access stores of food energy in body fat. If you use up the cash in your wallet, you will need to get the money in the harder-to-access bank account.A healthy body exists in a balance between feeding and fasting. Sometimes we store food energy (the fed state) and sometimes we burn it (the fasted state). It is hard to burn body fat, because it is naturally harder to gain access to. When insulin is high, your body wants to store food energy, not to burn it. Insulin blocks fat burning.High insulin tells us to make deposits into our \u2018fat bank\u2019. Low insulin tells us to make withdrawals from our \u2018fat bank\u2019. If you want to lose weight, you need to do two things. When making deposits, you want to make smaller deposits (eat lower insulin foods). This is the question of \u2018what to eat\u2019. Refined carbohydrates and sugar tend to cause the highest insulin levels. Therefore, reduce consumption of those foods. Second, you want to spend more time making withdrawals (spend more time in the fasted state). This is the question of \u2018when to eat\u2019. If you spend more time in the fasted state, then you will burn more stored food energy also known as body fat.All of weight loss comes down to these two things \u2014 what to eat, and when to eat. While we obsess about the first question, we almost ignore the second question. Is it better to eat 6 times a day, or once a day? If you eat 6 times a day, you are telling your body to store fat 6 times a day. That is a recipe for heartbreak and heartburn. The magic combination of eating low insulin foods, which is virtually all natural unprocessed foods, and intermittent fasting (remember that fasting is a part of everyday life) is the best, simplest method of long term weight loss.Insulin is one of the key hormonal regulator of body weight. Obesity is a hormonal imbalance, not a caloric one. Simply put, insulin causes obesity, so reducing insulin is the main stepping stone for weight loss. The dangerously misguided focus on calories does not necessarily address the underlying hormonal imbalance.Written byWritten by","6786":"It\u2019s time for some contentious words. Before I say those words, however, I want to make it known that I have been making money from stretching for a long time now. It\u2019s true. Stretching the body is one of my passions and I\u2019m pretty good at helping people improve their function through stretching. I don\u2019t confine my work to only stretching but I gotta say, it is a lot of the work I do and, anecdotally, it works really really well. Of course there are other factors that come into play with its effectiveness, but that\u2019s not what this article is about. That\u2019s my disclaimer. Now, on to the lengthy words.Lots of people have said lots of things about stretching.I\u2019m not going to say all of those things and I\u2019m not going to speak to the contentious issues. I\u2019ve read plenty of the research right up to 2018, including systematic reviews done in the last 12 months (and not just systematic reviews, either!), I\u2019ve read the opinion pieces, I\u2019ve read the terrible interpretations of the research on both sides of the camp \u2014 and there is a lot of error and silly things said by those pro- and those anti-stretching. This isn\u2019t the place to unpack that and, realistically, it\u2019s awefully big to unpack.Before going any further, though, I will say this: Stretching, done well, done inoffensively to the body, and done mindfully, without hurry, with a view to fully experiencing the sensation in your body, with gentle and humble breath, is one of the most divine, wonderful and body-blessing things you can do.Far from incidentally, I don\u2019t think stretching is about changing muscle length or reducing muscle tension or avoiding muscle injury. No. I think it\u2019s about mindfulness; it\u2019s about turning up your parasympathetic tone; it\u2019s about increasing your mindful tolerance of things you don\u2019t want to tolerate but won\u2019t harm you if you do; it\u2019s about remapping how your central nervous system perceives your body in space; and it\u2019s about giving your body a chance to exist differently. In short, stretching is about growing in personal insight and being changed because of it.In the process of beautiful stretching, you\u2019ll get changes in your body: muscles will relax, joints will move more freely, and your emotional state will change. There\u2019s nothing esoteric or mysterious about it \u2014 these changes are all easily explained through neuroscience and physiology. For me, however, stretching is about the experience during and after the stretch and it\u2019s the most mindful way to exist. Not just immediately, though, not just the acute changes. I mean a long term discipline of stretching and the changes it produces in my body. That experience \u2014 the freedom of movement, the freedom from certain pains, the feeling of comfort in my body\u2014 only comes about with a regular discipline of stretching combined with mindful meditation and strengthening.For me, however, stretching is about the experience during and after the stretch.It must be combined with strengthening and mindful relaxation to get the most benefit. And strengthening, in my opinion, needs to be combined with mindful, breath released stretching in order to get the most benefit. It\u2019s not either\/or. It\u2019s both\/and.There is little question about the efficacy of stretching to improve flexibility. It does. It will. In some people, the flexiblility change will be large and in others small.As with all things though, if you overdo your stretching, you\u2019ll probably not improve flexibility as much as you\u2019d like. I\u2019ve had a great many clients and exercise professionals tell me that they\u2019ve tried stretching and it hasn\u2019t worked. Typically, they stretch the same muscles every single day using the same stretches and they have no gains, so they say it doesn\u2019t work. But as I\u2019m fond of saying, if you always do what you\u2019ve always done, you always get what you\u2019ve always got. How can you do it differently?There are questions I might ask that client:There may be other questions depending on the client and the need of the moment.If you get these kind of things under control, you can find that flexibility starts to improve. But the goal should not be quick-fix flexibility. It should be long-term to achieve the best benefits. By that, I mean, is your goal to be able to do the splits in four weeks time? Or is it to be more mobile, more flexible and stronger in 15 years time?Having a long term plan is likely to result in less disapointment and safer gains and far more enjoyment from the journey.This reminds that there is another question to ask, but it needs to stand alone.8. Are you trying to force your body to improve flexibility? This one is vital. We cannot force the body into a greater range of motion because it is designed to resist that kind of force. We have a reflex built in that\u2019s called the stretch reflex and it, in turn, feeds into a second reflex called the withdrawal (or flexor) reflex. This one, in turn, integrates with a third reflex called the crossed-extensor reflex. I won\u2019t go into the physiology of these beauties here, but suffice it to say this: The stretch reflex makes the muscles contract if they get stretched too hard too quickly. This results in a signal from the central nervous system that this is a bad position to be in, and if it\u2019s too hard too soon, the central nervous system will send out an alarm signal known as pain. You\u2019ve met it before.Then, the withdrawal reflex kicks in. The body withdraws (pulls away from) the strong, undesirable sensation. The next thing that happens is that the body activates the crossed-extensor reflex, which is designed to simultaneously push away the thing that was dangerous and withdraw the threatened body part quickly. In other words, if you stretch too hard and try to force flexibility out of your body, it will resist you with all of its automated might.And here\u2019s where the really cool neural stuff comes in. At this point, you will have triggered some kind of anxiety response. This reponse occurs deep within your brain, in concert with your amygdala, and when it is activated strong enough and repeatedly, then the body creates a more solid picture of that anxiety-inducing phenomenon. It induces fear. The fear of doing that stretch. The anxiety of unwanted sensation. Once that happens, the body won\u2019t want you to go anywhere near that stretch position. Push it as much as you like and you\u2019ll just reinforce the negative association.There is, however, some evidence out there in the literature to show that a slow and almost coaxing stretch will elicit a better response. You still need to take yourself to the point of discomfort, but you do it slowly and without offense. You have to convince your body it wants to change, calmly coax it into the place where it can\u2019t help but change itself.This doesn\u2019t mean the stretch won\u2019t be uncomfortable. Much of the research shows us that what happens when you stretch is you grow in your ability to tolerate the stretch sensation. The same signal of stretch is going to the nervous system, it\u2019s just that you change your relationship with it. This is similar, if you think about it, to what happens when we remap someone with a traumatic experience. We teach them to play again, to expose themselves to playfully challenging scenarios with a safe and easy escape system, one where failure is part of the process of change. We gradually expose them to the perceieved dangers until they can distinguish between the things that are truly dangerous and the things that are not. So it is when you stretch: the strong stretch sensation may not actually be one of pain but of strong discomfort because your body doesn\u2019t yet understand that this position is safe.Of course, we never go into a stretch if it elicits a strong pain sensation \u2014 the pain of injury. Our goal is to avoid the pain of injury and to discern the difference between a strong stretch sensation and pain. That will feel different to all people and will take a lot longer in some people than others. That\u2019s why we approach it slowly and almost coaxingly try to give the body a chance to adapt. Edge close to that place of discomfort and rest there calmly and help the body adjust its response accordingly; do it lovingly. Do it gently. Do it with a long view in mind.How long should you hold a stretch for?The literature is pretty solid on this one. The best range to hold a stretch for is somewhere from 90 seconds to 180 seconds. That is, between 1.5 and 3 minutes. Now for some muscles and some people, it can be five minutes long; and I have to say, personally, I do love a long stretch. Never in a hurry. But generally, you want to hold your position for up to three minutes.That\u2019s a long time.During that time, you can expore the sensations in your body. When your mind daydreams, which it will and that\u2019s to be expected, acknowledge that it wandered off and then bring your attention and awareness back to the sensations coming from the stretching region. I invite you to feel those sensations. Perhaps you can expplore what colour they are, or what other thing they feel like. Perhaps you can feel the sensation change from one region to another. Maybe you can notice at some point the joint eases a little or the sensation increases a little.Some people find their body temperature increases and others find their mood calms dramatically. Some people experience feelings of anxiety for a time which tend to melt away at some point and return to normal or even to a sense of calm elation. Whatever you do, sit with the experience, immerse yourself in it and let it be for you a mindful meditation.Of course, through it all, you can remember that you are coaxing your body into feeling safe here, reminding it that this position actually is safe. So make sure your experience is a safe one. Don\u2019t force it. Just sit there with it on the edge of discomfort, breathing slowly in and slower out and discovering that this place can, in an instant, become a place of comfort.I want you to understand at this point that not everyone has profound sensations when they stretch. It\u2019s true. In fact, you shouldn\u2019t make feeling profound sensations or emotions your goal \u2014 it\u2019s just not the way some people experience it. Rather, just feel whatever you feel, without judgment either way. If you feel something, simply attend to it. If you don\u2019t feel something, simply attend to that non-feeling.It\u2019s common for one side to feel vastly different to the other. That, too, is okay. Simpy feel that feeling. It\u2019s also common for a stretch today in one body region to feel entirely different to the same stretch on a different day. That\u2019s enitrely normal also. The goal is not to feel any particular sensation but to feel whatever sensation the body gives you in that moment.There are different ways to stretch. I usually advocate one sometimes known as the contract-relax method of stretching \u2026 but it\u2019s not the only one I use. Suffice it to say, find the method that works well for you and become comfortable using it. When your body can tolerate well the strong sensations and you have a different relationship with the stretch experience, then perhaps you can seek out some new ways of stretching. And remember, you don\u2019t want to do strong, long stretches before a workout, competition or training. Put stretching either at the end of a workout or on a completely different day.Here\u2019s a nice summary.Stretching is a wonderful addition to any health program. It\u2019s needs to be seen as an experience and not a means to an end. Journey before destination and all else will follow.Hey there. I just want to say thank you for taking the time out to read my article. I really appreciate it, so thank you!

We use a range of different sequencing approaches, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, full metagenomics, and our patented precision sequencing\u2122.One of our earliest advisors was Dr. Joe DeRisi, Professor at UCSF, MacArthur Genius award winner, sequencing pioneer, and inventor of numerous sequencing techniques. uBiome has filed patents on over 15 new sequencing methods, including precision sequencing\u2122, CRISPR-based library preparation, combinations of RNA and DNA, as well as optimizing current methods for the microbiome.We have a team of over 60 scientists working with molecular as well as computational techniques for understanding the human microbiome. And each month, we generate terabytes of sequencing data. Our dataset, which is over 250,000 samples and projected to be over 1 million by the end of next year, is the largest human microbiome dataset in the world.Even though 16S sequencing is just part of what we do, it is an important tool in the toolbox of anyone trying to understand the microbiome. It is one of the best techniques for high-throughput analysis of thousands of samples. The 16S gene is present in every bacterium and archaeon. Because so many labs all over the world have been and are using this approach, 16S sequence databases are unparalleled in size. So almost every 16S sequence read can tell you which bacteria and archaea are present in a sample.There was a recent interesting discussion on Medium and Twitter about the usefulness of 16S sequencing. Eran Segal and Jonathan Eisen, two scientists and pioneers in the microbiome research world, both agreed that 16S sequencing is a great approach for microbial community analysis.We wanted to take a closer look at some of these recent claims made about 16S sequencing and see if we could help shed some light. What is true about 16S sequencing, and what is just \u201cfake news\u201d?\u201c16S sequencing is useless. It is a complete waste of your money.\u201dSince the birth of microbiome research, the 16S rRNA gene (\u201c16S\u201d) has been recognized as a powerful tool with which to classify microorganisms. 16S is a gene that is present in all bacteria and archaea (another type of microorganism). 16S sequencing can be used to identify these microorganisms and determine their relative abundance in a biological sample, such as your gut.16S sequencing was the technique of choice for the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Human Microbiome Project, in addition to thousands of laboratories worldwide. Each year, hundreds of scientific studies based on the 16S gene are published. Focusing on the same gene has allowed researchers all over the world to compare results with each other and build databases that contain millions of 16S sequences. The Ribosomal Database Project, for example, has over 3 million different 16S rRNA sequences, and the SILVA Database has over 2 million.These extensive databases are an advantage of using 16S instead of whole genome DNA or transcriptomic (RNA) sequencing. The number of bacterial and archaeal genomes that have been sequenced to (near) completion is much smaller; NCBI\u2019s Genome Database contains only 135,000 different genomes so far. Other widely utilized databases, such as KEGG, only contain information for around 5,300 organisms.Simply put: if you use 16S sequencing, there is a large chance that your sequence will be present in the 16S database, making it easy to identify to which bacteria or archaea the gene belongs. If you use metagenomic or metatranscriptomic analysis, on the other hand, your chance of finding a sequence in the genomic databases is much smaller and could simply be reported as an \u201cunknown gene from an unknown bacteria\u201d. Not so useful.At uBiome, we have developed our own curated 16S database from our dataset of human microbiomes, which is the largest in the world. For our products, we use a version of this 16S database that we use to report genus or species-level taxa. In addition, our team of bioinformaticians and engineers have developed automated pipelines in which every read is compared to this database.\u201c16S can only identify bacteria.\u201dThis is misleading, at best; over 99% of the genes in our gut are bacterial, so focusing on bacteria is not a bad thing. Moreover, the method we use at uBiome to amplify and sequence the 16S gene can identify both bacteria and archaea, a group of microorganisms discovered in 1977 by Carl Woese using \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 16S rRNA gene sequencing. So whoever said this may not have heard of archaea, which also happens to be the third domain of life. It is true that fungi and yeasts cannot be identified with this method. However, they can be identified with some of the other methods we use in our products \u2014 full metagenomic and precision sequencing\u2122.\u201c16S is just one gene. Metagenomics or metatranscriptomics will identify all living organisms\u201dLet\u2019s say that your sample contains 1,000 different bacterial species, and each species contains, in general, between 2,000 to 5,000 different genes. That is between two and five million different genes!Put differently, imagine you have thousands of different puzzles, each with a different design, and all the puzzle pieces are mixed together in one big box. Undoubtedly, there are many fewer corner pieces than center puzzle pieces, and it would be much easier to match 100 corner pieces to the different designs than 100 middle pieces. Similarly, it is much easier to match 10,000 16S reads to the species that they belong to than 10,000 random gene reads. Because 16S analysis focuses on just one gene, all 10,000 or more sequencing reads are of the 16S gene. The extensive databases we mentioned earlier allow us to easily tell which bacteria are present in your sample. It is also very likely that we will be able to find 16S reads from all of these 1,000 species.With a minimum of 10,000 sequencing reads, each bacterium will be, on average, covered 10 times.With metagenomic or metatranscriptomic analysis, the same 10,000 sequencing reads will not be enough to cover all 1 million different genes in the sample. Many of these can not be matched to a known organism because, the genomic databases are not large enough. If you want to go really deep into the analysis of your sample, you will need to sequence millions of reads, which will cost you easily 100 times as much as a 16S analysis.That is why we also developed our patented precision sequencing\u2122 platform, a technique that combines 16S sequencing with enhanced features. We are very excited about this, and we hope to tell you more about that in a future blog.\u201cIn some recent scientific publications, the 16S technology has been shown to produce lots of false results. A peer-reviewed study by Edgar determined that 16S sequencing of known bacterial communities resulted in a 56% to 88% false positive rate of predicted genus names.\u201dThis is partially correct, but it\u2019s not applicable to uBiome data. The study mentioned above (Edgar) was investigating a very specific bioinformatics analysis pipeline (QIIME) and a very specific 16S rRNA gene reference database (Greengenes). One of the problems identified in this study was that, in the Greengenes database, certain genera were placed under multiple families, thus creating unreliable taxonomic lineages.As we wrote above, at uBiome we use a proprietary bioinformatics pipeline and a different, manually curated sequence database that does not have these taxonomic overlaps.We have made sure that there are no genera that fall under different taxonomic lineages. So the problem described above does not apply to our bioinformatics analysis. If we label a 16S sequence with a name, you can rest assured that we got the taxonomy right.\u201cBoth 16S and metagenomic methods have another drawback: they analyze DNA, not live microorganisms. DNA is very stable, so even DNA from the food we consume and from dead microorganisms finds its way into stool samples, thus wasting sequencing data and confounding the analyses\u201dThis is partially true. DNA is indeed very stable, but the DNA from the food we eat is already chemically or enzymatically degraded in the stomach and in the intestines. About 99% of the genes in our stool come from bacteria, not from our food, so in metagenomic sequencing hardly any data is wasted at all. In addition, RNA is more unstable than DNA, so the inverse problem could be true for samples for metatranscriptomics: since RNA has a very short life-span, the estimation of microbial activity from metatranscriptomics will always underestimate the actual activity of the microbes from a sample.\u201c16S sequencing is unreproducible and unreliable. If you sequence the same sample twice, you will get very different results\u201dThis is false.The source of this claim is likely a post on the website Science News, where the same sample was analyzed by 2 different groups: uBiome and American Gut (a nonprofit university project). uBiome\u2019s sampling method contains a proprietary stabilization buffer, which preserves your sample immediately after sampling. American Gut does not provide a stabilization buffer, so some bacteria can keep on growing as the sample gets shipped to the laboratory.Since these 2 assays use very different shipping conditions and DNA extraction methods, it is not surprising that the same sample sent to 2 different companies can give different results. We responded officially to this in 2014 on the uBiome Blog.Sequencing of the same sample using uBiome\u2019s technologies is extremely reproducible. In fact, in the graph below you can see that analyzing the same sample 50 times leads to remarkably similar results! (In fact, we are submitting an article for peer-review on this very subject.)\u201c16S sequencing will only provide you with genus-level data. On genus level, our microbiomes are 95% identical.\u201dThis simply isn\u2019t true.Each person has their own unique microbiome. Thanks to our microbiomes, we look as different from each other on the inside as we do on the outside!Still not convinced? Below you\u2019ll find a graph of genus-level gut microbiome data from 50 different people, analyzed using uBiome\u2019s testing kits. As you can see, we\u2019re all very different!\u201cGenus level is not accurate enough. The resolution is too low. Humans, dogs, and rats all belong to the same genus. At the genus level, we are all mammals \u2014 so genus level analysis is useless.\u201dThis is completely wrong! Whoever said this perhaps didn\u2019t pay attention during science class.Mammals are a class, not a genus. Humans are Homo sapiens \u2014 belonging to the genus Homo. Even our closest relative, chimpanzees, belong to a different genus, Pan. Genus level analysis is pretty good in telling all of us mammals apart, and, for bacteria and archaea, genus-level analysis has equally good resolution.uBiome\u2019s analysis often goes even deeper than genus-level analysis. For example, the probiotics panel on our Explorer product reports to the species level. Our clinical products, SmartGut and SmartJane, use precision sequencing\u2122 to identify a panel of gut microbes on species level, with high specificity and sensitivity. SmartGut identifies 13 species and 13 genera, while SmartJane identifies 17 species and 15 genera. The science behind the selection of each of these targets, and the validation of the methods to make sure that we can detect them with high precision is available online, so you can read more about that if you like. For SmartGut, that information has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific paper in PLOS ONE, while a preprint of the development of the SmartJane assay is available as well.Two of our current products offer species-level precision sequencing, but even the resolution of our Explorer product, where genus level is used, is high enough to distinguish all of us from each other.Edit Note: @AlexJProbst correctly pointed out on Twitter that 16S rRNA gene sequencing cannot be used to determine the absolute abundance of microorganisms. We change the sentence to clarify that relative abundance was meant.

I was a 6th grade teacher in a low-economic, drug and gang-ridden community. The job equated stress. However, I loved my students, even the ones who challenged me to do so.Over a couple of days that fall, I lost my ability to speak. I had recently been under the weather, so I wasn\u2019t surprised that my doctor treated me for laryngitis. However, my voice never returned. Nearly a month had passed when my doctor finally recommended I see an otolaryngologist.He scoped and examined me. Without skipping a beat, he said that there wasn\u2019t any medical reason for my lack of voice, and he referred me to a speech pathologist. Really? Skepticism filled me.Sitting in the waiting room for speech therapy, I saw only young patients with their moms, probably there due to stutters, inability to say their r\u2019s, and such. When the therapist called me back, she asked me to repeat words and phrases. It only took her a couple minutes at most to tell me that I had forgotten how to breathe properly. No, that doesn\u2019t sound right; ridiculous! I was in denial. However, I soon realized her veraciousness.Turns out, I was so tense and stressed that I was holding my breath without realizing it\u2026even while attempting to speak. No breath was passing through my larynx to vibrate my vocal chords (how voice is made). I had only a whisper, and I was told to definitely not do that. Apparently, whispering actually causes more trauma to the larynx than normal speech, as does shouting or other modes of misusing the voice.I must be able to communicate with my students. During the interim, I attempted to convey information to my young scholars via writing. It was a struggle\u2026for them and for me. Several already had a lack of reading skills; my heart went out to them. Surprisingly, they were quite patient with me.Through guided speaking, breathing and relaxation exercises, I rediscovered my voice. I gradually relearned how to breathe and how to breathe while speaking. I practiced breathing\u2026and practiced breathing while speaking\u2026until it became natural again. During my recovery, I began to sound like a cross between Steven Tyler and Miley Cyrus\u2026a voice still hoarse, but a voice returning.I slowly became mindful of my body tension and breathing. Every now and then, I still catch myself holding my breath, but I now have the mindfulness and skills to maintain my voice and seek inner calmness.\u2192How has stress affected you?Read more by Alicia T.

Starting about 10 years later, type 2 diabetes has also risen dramatically. Prevention and treatment strategies are global priorities.A randomized controlled trial done in 2016 showed that green tea helped in the treatment of obesity. Numerous supplements have been purported to help with weight loss, but most fail when tested in a scientifically rigorous manner. Many miracle diet pills have come and gone. There were the prescription drugs like Fen-Phen, which, like the old street drug \u2018speed\u2019 caused weight loss, but also caused all kinds of heart problems. Fen-Phen could make you thin, but could also kill you. There was Orlistat, which blocks fat absorption. It caused weight loss, but also some bothersome side effects like diarrhea from all that mal-absorbed fat. Best advice for Orlistat? Don\u2019t wear white pants. Then there was Meridia, which caused weight loss, but a little side effect like heart attacks and strokes caused it to be discontinued.There was also weight loss supplements that wouldn\u2019t kill you, but didn\u2019t really work either. Green coffee, raspberry ketones and grapefruit extract all come to mind. They sound great, but they all turned out to be pure hype. One substance, though seems to have stood the test of time \u2014 green tea, with traditional Asian medicine touting the weight loss effects for thousands of years.Modern randomized trials are just now demonstrating the benefits of tea for cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure and cholesterol. Green tea is particularly beneficial due to it\u2019s high concentration of EGCG, a type of catechin (50\u201380% of total catechins in green tea). Catechins are absorbed in the intestine, but the presence of food significantly decreases absorption. Studies often use green tea extracts due to the dose needed, but also because the bio-availability in extracts is much higher than brewed tea. Typically a cup of brewed tea may have 70\u2013100 g of catechins. Cold brew crystals have about triple that amount per cup.In the 2016 randomized, placebo controlled trial, researchers used a fairly high dose of EGCG of 856 mg, which required high dose green tea extract (GTE). Trying to drink this much from hot brewed green tea is daunting as it would require 12 cups per day. Supplements have high placebo effects, so randomization and placebo controlling is important. If people believe a supplement will make them lose weight, it generally will, no matter what it is. In order to maximize extraction of EGCG, the GTE was prepared by steeping green tea leaves in pure water at 90 C three times for 20 minutes each, then cooling the extract to preserve the catechin content. The extract was dried under low temperature and pressure conditions and also decaffeinated.The GTE lowered body weight by about 1 kg and reduced the waist circumference as well. The placebo, by contrast did not reduce either body weight or waist size.Ghrelin showed a trend towards lowering, but a significant difference when compared to the placebo group (not shown in this table). GTE reduced ghrelin from 621 to 529, where the placebo increased it from 599 to 664, so there was a big statistically significant difference between two groups.Ghrelin is often referred to as the \u2018hunger hormone\u2019. If ghrelin is high, then you are hungrier. Anecdotal studies and personal experience have hinted at the appetite suppressing effect of green tea but this provides some rational basis for explaining how high dose catechin suppresses hunger. Adiponectin was also increased significantly, which is good although the exact significance is unknown. It has known anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic properties, but this effect is not consistently seen in the literature.Obviously, better hunger control hunger leads to eating less and weight loss. Hunger is a powerful obstacle because it is one of the most basic of human instincts. The three most powerful human needs are known as the 3F\u2019s \u2014 Fluids, Feeding and Procreation. You may be able to temporarily ignore hunger, but when it persists for day after day, it becomes progressively more difficult to ignore. Controlling hunger is one of the keys to long term weight loss. Most calorie restriction plans ignore this factor, pretending it is all about will power. You can\u2019t \u2018decide\u2019 to be less hungry. Fasting, on the other hand, tends to reduce overall hunger. Green tea, with its small effect on decreasing ghrelin is a great complement to fasting.A 2009 meta-analysis had reached the same conclusion that green tea may cause a loss of 1.31 kg of body weight. Asians show consistently better results compared to Caucasians perhaps as a result of genetic differences in COMT (the enzyme blocked by catechins, discussed in previous post) activity, which can vary by as much as 3-fold. Asians have a higher frequency of the high-activity COMT variation, so therefore may benefit more from the inhibition of COMT by green tea catechins. Weight loss for Asians averaged 1.51 kg, but only 0.8 kg for Caucasians. However, 0.8kg is still a substantial benefit.The other major differences between Asian and Caucasian populations include the typical Asian preference for green or oolong tea versus black (higher levels of catechins) and the fact that Asians often drink tea like water, so drink more throughout the day.Caffeine itself may play a synergistic role in increasing metabolic rate. A meta-analysis of 15 studies showed that shows that green tea catechins given with caffeine was able to decrease body weight compared to catechins given alone. I will note that green tea does in fact contain some caffeine, whereas green tea extracts are may or may not contain it. Some studies sugges that regular and high caffeine usage may blunt the benefits of the GTE. In one study, using more than 300 mg\/day of caffeine daily negated much of the benefits (a cup of brewed green tea only has 30 mg caffeine). Caucasian population typically drink more coffee and perhaps higher doses of catechins are necessary for benefits.In addition to effects to suppress hunger, the increased noradrenalin may act to increase 24 hour energyexpenditure. A small randomized controlled trial of green tea extract increased caloric expenditure by 4%. A meta-analysis of studies on the increased energy expenditurealso generally found a synergistic effect of catechins and caffeine.Ancient traditional Chinese medicine believes tea to have weight loss effects, and these beliefs are increasing found since the 1990s in westernized world as natural herbs that may increase energy expenditure. The stimulatory effects of the catechin-caffeine combination is greater than caffeine alone. Fat oxidation (the burning of fat for energy) increases with the catechin+caffeine but not so much with the caffeine alone group, except perhaps at very high doses.Oolong tea may also show this beneficial effect and raises energy expenditure by 2.9%. Oolong tea is fermented and the catechins are partially converted to theaflavins. Oolong tea is not fully fermented like black tea, and thus represents a sort of mid-way between green and black tea. It is very popular in China and Japan.Based on studies such as these, the optimal supplement would provide high doses of catechins with a smaller dose of caffeine (ie. not decaffeinated). This would have all the benefits of hunger suppression, increased energy expenditure, and fat oxidation. The dose would require 10 cups of green tea per day, but by using a cold brew technique, we can get this down to 3 cups per day in a easy to use formulation.Written byWritten by","6861":"In Sanskrit, when the letter A is placed in front of a word, it negates it. Meaning, not that.As taught and sold today;Yoga may indeed be for everyone, but everyone is not meant for yoga. The enormous work required on the part of the practitioner cannot be underestimated.Yoga is only for those that are willing and able to do the work. We should not attend classes with the misguided expectations of having someone else fix us. Nor should yoga teachers make those promises.Yoga is not relaxing. The preparatory work at the beginning, and for many many years after, can be more like performing surgery without anesthetics. It can be like undergoing hundreds of psychiatric sessions under a hot spotlight.Yoga attempts to shatter all delusion and everything we have ever believed in and thought to be true so we can get to the soul. When awareness dawns and we begin to recognize our deep conditioned ways, it can be far from pleasurable or convenient. However once accepted, a greater sense of peace and calm may arrive. But until then, consider the opposite and understand what one has signed up for.The first thing people say to me when they find out I teach yoga is \u201cOh, you must be so relaxed\u201d. The next is \u201cSo you\u2019re a vegetarian\u201d. I\u2019ll leave the latter comment for another post.It could possibly be this false belief of a chilled out occupation we so desire that draws the hordes to yoga teacher trainings. It doesn\u2019t take us long to discover that having steady streams of strangers arriving daily with the hopes and expectations of being miraculously fixed, cured and remedied of their aches, pains, illnesses, sorrows, job and relationship troubles all while being entertained by a sweaty workout, is the farthest thing from relaxing.Many people come to class expecting to be led by an expert contortionist, nutritionist, psychologist, physiotherapist, astrologer, doctor and shaman all wrapped up in a tight little package wearing cool leggings and a top knot bun.Yoga encompasses several modalities of healing methods that when observed and practiced offer ways of how to relate and become in tune to life in a healthy manner, from diet and exercise, to music and grammar, astrology and arranging living space, to mind training, developing super powers, healing and freedom from rebirth. Sounds so enticing, of course so many people want to practice it!Teacher trainings today are taught by a \u2018faculty\u2019. We have taken a craft that required years of apprenticeship under a single guide in strict conditions and converted it into the Western school system, based on certificates and stripped of anything remotely resembling its essence.A variety of experts in handstands, backbends and restoratives, a musician, a meditation guide, an anatomy expert, a philosophy teacher, an ethics life coach, a legal and business adviser, all lead a group of innocent students through a month of how to teach yoga to others in a school room setting. Complete the hours required and walk away with a certificate in hand. Factory produced instructors being pumped out monthly, unleashed into the world selling more of what they were taught.If we draw on the texts of yoga and how it was practiced (as close as we can possibly assume it began) it was purely a spiritual practice seeking transcendental states in order not to have to be reborn again, thereby being freed of suffering. It was a way to die at will and not have to return in human form. Anatomy course not included. Few practiced back then. Therefore, yoga was not meant as therapy, was not meant for the sick, and finally, yoga was not meant for everyone.Back in the day, gurus would teach a handful of students and just one at a time. Not many could do all that was entailed in a yoga practice. All money, possessions and pastimes renounced, the entire day was spent practicing techniques that will eventually only lead to the removal of life. One had to be really called to the life of yoga. It was never meant for everyone and rarely passed on to even those that pursued it, only to those that truly deserved it.Times change, mistakes are encountered, people seek wider pastures and things must adapt to the needs of societies and their current problems arising. Although yoga was never meant for the public masses or the sick, practicing it can still relieve a lot of their suffering.What we are practicing today is not Yoga, however, it does seem to be helping a lot of folks and it appears we are better off for it.We stretch out tension, relieve some stress, get in touch with our breath and posture, feel stronger, gain confidence and that is great stuff. But is it \u2018yoga\u2019 that is helping or is it simply stretching out a few kinks, learning basic movement patterns and taking the time to breathe while surviving a hectic day and stressful world?Perhaps we can find another name to use for it because none of us are actually doing yoga. The words exercise, calisthenics and gymnastics have already been taken, plus we need to add a sense of relaxation to it.Soul Stretching, Move and Renew, Tension Tonic, Spirit Conditioning, Reach and Release, Lunge and Let Go?I really don\u2019t know, but the word yoga has been highjacked by anyone trying to get on the money wagon and I am pretty sure we are not doing it or even remotely close to it\u2019s original design or intention.I can\u2019t say when it happened, maybe when Madonna announced she does yoga on Oprah in 1998, or Christy Turlington was featured on the cover of Time Magazine in 2001, or the Beatles in India back in 1968, or even much earlier in 1893 when Swami Vivekananda came to Chicago. I don\u2019t believe one can ever pinpoint a beginning or think there will be an end. It\u2019s just what happens, how we survive and entertain ourselves throughout our brief existence.Transformations were clearly made from renunciate hermits and wandering ascetics, to intellectuals pursuing meditation, to hippies seeking mind altering states, to wealthy women juicing and wearing designer tights. Main yoga studios were gobbled up by corporate ownership, franchises opened and now yoga is a massive industry that crosses the entire planet.There is A LOT of yoga being sold out there. We are, among other things, very creative beings.Raja yoga, Hatha yoga, Shadow yoga, Bikram yoga, Iyengar yoga, Sivananda yoga, Ashtanga yoga, Kundalini yoga, Kriya yoga, Hot yoga, Jivamukti yoga, Moksha yoga, Integral yoga, Vijnana yoga, Bhakti yoga, Laya yoga, Mantra yoga, Karma yoga, Jnana yoga, Anusara yoga, Power yoga, Restorative yoga, Gentle yoga, Yin yoga, Satyananda yoga, Viniyoga, Forrest yoga, Prana yoga, Vinyasa yoga, Nada yoga, Nadi yoga, Isha yoga, Art of Living yoga, Baptiste yoga, Ayurvedic yoga, Live Music yoga, Tantra yoga, Shamanic yoga, Hebrew yoga, Egyptian yoga, African yoga, Kids yoga, Prenatal yoga, Mommy and Baby yoga, Couples yoga, Seniors yoga, Community yoga, Alignment yoga, Laughter yoga, Sound yoga, Wholistic yoga, Queer yoga, Naked yoga, Bliss yoga, Acro yoga, Flying yoga, Aerial yoga, Bouncy House yoga, Sound Off yoga, Topless yoga, Coffee yoga, Chocolate yoga, Beer yoga, Ganja yoga, Cat yoga, Dog yoga, Goat yoga, yoga for Horses, yoga Therapy, yoga for Golfers, yoga for Runners, yoga for Backs, yoga for Hamstrings, yoga for Abs, YogaFit, yoga for Lesbians, yoga for Gays, yoga for Men, yoga for Women, yoga for Teens, yoga for Trans, yoga for Fat People, yoga for Sex Addicts, yoga for Dummies, and Corporate yoga.A person who is new to yoga and looking for a class will be hard-pressed to sift through all the noise. They will most likely wind up turning to what is the most popular, cheapest and most convenient to get to. We used to call them gyms. Yoga studios offer 12 hours worth of daily classes based on what mood you are in and the perfect instructor to satisfy that craving. Many studios don\u2019t even have a list of teachers rather say it\u2019s their team that will guide you through classes.If teachers do actually post a biography, one can no longer find practical information of experience such as what teachers they have studied with, how long they have been practicing or what trainings they have completed, instead we find descriptions of how much they love yoga and how they will make you feel if you come to their class.When did yoga turn into entertainment?Millions flock to be relaxed and entertained by agile athletics choreographed to a soothing playlist, searching for that spiritual spa. Live music gets introduced and we now have more distractions. Like in gyms with music blaring, headphones are worn while we follow mindlessly the instructor on stage going through a choreographed dance sequence. Instead of inner silence, internal focus on sounds and breath awareness, we get to choose a playlist.This has obviously gone on since the beginning of time since written in almost every yoga text is the author complaining of the ones who don\u2019t get it, who don\u2019t understand, who don\u2019t really know, who mixed things up, who sold out, those stupid ignorant people ruining everything.Even the Hathayogapradipika of Swatmarama, a compilation of texts in the 15th century, says the practice of Hatha yoga is for those who have not been able to grasp Raja yoga.\u201cOwing to the darkness arising from the multiplicity of opinions (philosophies) people are unable to know the Raja Yoga. Compassionate Swatmarama composes the Hatha Yoga Pradipika like a torch to dispel it.\u201d(chapter one, verse 3)Each teacher\u2019s lessons are misunderstood, misquoted, misinterpreted and misused. We can never know if the texts written were done so by actual practitioners or by men hired to transcribe and compile a system.I heard the Chinese have a saying, \u201cthe real becomes the false and the false becomes the real\u201d.This is what happened to yoga and is what seems to have happened to everything humans ever touched since the beginning of time. We change things.We grab on to something, spin it into a marketable item, make it big, overdo it, build it up only to tear it down through mockery and satiation. Whether it is out of ignorance, misunderstanding, inability to grasp knowledge, fear or greed, who knows. But this is what we seem to do.Each generation believes they know the real thing and that the younger ones have screwed it up. The younger ones think the older ones have messed it up for them and they don\u2019t know what they are talking about. And so it goes. Information is watered down, techniques dumbed down and eventually spun into something completely different because people are just not getting it.Our way of life resembles nothing like the society of the ancient yogis\u2019 time. We don\u2019t eat the same way or grow the same food, we live in different climates, we now have furniture, cars, laptops, electricity and Instagram. We face different problems and concerns, we require much different techniques and we have different ambitions.But one desire can never change when it comes to a yoga practice. That is the deep longing for inner peace that comes with self-knowledge. A pursuit to end our suffering, to discriminate between real and unreal, and to uncover and reunite with our creator.Everything else is just stress relief.There is only ONE yoga and it encompasses ALL styles, branding, trademarks, marketing, endorsements and property ownerships. A student with a good foundation and proper physical preparation should be able to walk into any style of yoga class and pick it up because they have learnt how to be adaptable in their mind and how to properly move in their body. A seeker of that ONE truth will keep searching until they find a teacher, not a style. Those that don\u2019t fall into the trap will continue on their own in secret, away from public scrutiny as has always been.Perhaps it\u2019s our turning away from organized religion that has caused people to turn towards yoga. We still seek that connection with Spirit, just not to a man-made god. We are confronted with too many rules and exclusions with organized religion yet we still require to have faith in something.Maybe I write to vent my bitterness on what I think has been done to yoga and to what I believe to be real disappearing. My attachment to the past, my inability to go with the flow and change with the times. Perhaps it\u2019s a showing of my age and a grasp at my fleeting existence.Or maybe people have really lost their way and this is my meagre attempt to salvage any dignity for my beloved glorious art that has kept me alive, reasonably healthy, helped me find a relatively decent place of mental stability and has guided me in helping to discriminate between the real and the false. Wow, yoga can do so much!I hope you get a giggle from my writings, a wake-up call and\/or some inspiration to dig deeper into your soul.Radhasri (Rhonda Fogel) has been teaching yoga in Canada since 1998 and is the founder of Hatha Yoga Shala currently based in Montreal.

The amoral business models of Facebook and Google produce a glut of low-substance and false information, media with no nutritional value. Heartless algorithms worsen the situation, incentivized to give us a diet consisting of, to quote a former Facebook engineer, \u201cendless sugar and fat.\u201dContemporary consumers of information are trapped in a funhouse that\u2019s not very fun. Our postmodern equation is looping instead of spiraling, our snake is now eating its excreted tail. Recursion, but dark. You could even call this epoch \u201ctrans-modern\u201d; at its best exemplified by the bucolic Yankees embroidery at Gucci, elevated by Alessandro Michele and modeled by Hari Nef, and at its worst an eerily oracular Trump tweet or the steady, terrifying march of Chinese artificial intelligence and surveillance.Words no longer have to mean things, and this is a perfect recipe for authoritarianism. All over the globe, bad men (and some women) have taken advantage of the blurring of facts and fiction. They\u2019ve got a front row seat to watch the world burn: Real reality TV.We are not well. Or even \u201cwell.\u201d The Internet is breaking humans.By many metrics, we\u2019re better off than we\u2019ve ever been; we\u2019re wiping out poverty, women are making economic gains, child mortality is low, life expectancy is high, and so are literacy and sanitation. But these improvements do little to shake the feeling that we\u2019ve gone off the rails: Brexit, #metoo, Russian hacks, children separated from their parents at borders, children being shot in schools, and the spectacle of it all on social media. Some people are enjoying more longevity and better quality-of-life, but we can\u2019t shake the feeling that we\u2019re stuck in a collective bad dream, a nightmare where the only bright spot is that we\u2019re in it together.Waking up to this American president, this toxic news environment and this very strange time is particularly hard on the psyche, particularly for those of us who suffer from anxiety and depression. A cast of volatile caricatures, narcissistic totems who don\u2019t read books, have at their fingertips the power to kill us all instantly. And they are arguing over whose button is bigger. On Twitter.Could being in it together be enough to stave off the desire to quit this life? There are worlds in other people. There are strings that connect us that we can\u2019t fathom or see. \u201cIf humanity ever captures the energies of love, it will be the second time in history that it will have discovered fire,\u201d Reverend Michael Curry declared at the Royal Wedding, itself the union of a colonial figurehead to a descendent of slaves.

He bridged the distance between us with the most immediate form of art: food.I\u2019ve never felt cooler than when I felt like him, an explorer of the great, uncharted landmass of my life and the eater of a humble Icelandic hot dog or a scorpion deep-fried in Chiang Mai, no turmeric lattes in sight.Bourdain insisted that we get both physical and spiritual sustenance (and substance) from our consumption, whether it was cheap noodles or prose. He implored us to inhabit the moment rather than escape it, to dig into a meal, and the truth, no matter how messy or unfamiliar. Watching his show and reading his writing, I felt like Rainer Maria Rilke observing Rodin.

There is no cure for mental illness. One can get better with treatment, but that doesn\u2019t mean life is \u201cnormal\u201d. It\u2019s work\u2026every single day. It\u2019s hard.Some who have mental illness try to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol, to numb the pain. I believe that there are many addicts who suffer from mental illness and just don\u2019t realize it.After the news broke of Kate Spade\u2019s completed suicide, I chatted with a woman online regarding the situation. She, and others, made it blatantly clear that Kate was being selfish because she had a daughter, and as a mother she should be putting her child first.She said, \u201c[Kate Spade] has a young child. When you have kids, you put them before yourself. I could never imagine leaving my young daughter alone to fight the world\u2026 what will that do to her?\u201dThose who suffer from suicidal thoughts are convinced by their own mind that it is a selfless act and that their children, their family, and their friends are all better off without them.I explained to this woman that the beliefs she\u2019s holding onto are cemented in stigma; however, she denied she has any stigma related to mental illness. In fact, she continued by saying, \u201cIt seems as though she only thought about herself. With all that money, she should be able to afford the help.\u201dOf course, she could afford the help, but did she know that she really needed the help? For decades, I assumed how I felt was \u201cnormal\u201d, that everyone felt like this and I just sucked at coping.

They (the mentally ill) need to step up and ask for the help. The first step to getting better, is to acknowledge you have a problem.\u201dI attempted to explain that acknowledging the \u201cproblem\u201d and getting help is just not as simple as she feels it is. It IS a MENTAL illness, after all. Her response, \u201cNot sure how [it\u2019s not simple]. If an alcoholic or a druggy admits they have issues, AA for them.\u201dAt this point in the conversation, I had to stop\u2026for my own sanity. My anxiety was rising, and I was becoming angry. Angry that this type of stigma is still so strong within areas of our community.\u201cOne of the main problems with mental illness is that it prevents you from behaving or thinking \u2018normally\u2019. A depression sufferer is not thinking like a non-sufferer in the same way that someone who\u2019s drowning is not \u2018breathing air\u2019 like a person on land is.\u201d\u201cDepression is a genuine debilitating condition, and being in \u201ca bit of a funk\u201d isn\u2019t. \u2026If you haven\u2019t had it, you don\u2019t have the right to dismiss those who do. You may disagree, and that\u2019s your prerogative, but there are decades\u2019 worth of evidence saying you\u2019re wrong.\u201dSo, what is it about Kate Spade that is bringing out this judgement? Is it because she\u2019s a celebrity? No. I didn\u2019t hear such things when Robin Williams (who has grown children), Chris Cornell (with children ages 12, 13, 17), or Chester Bennington (with children ages 7, 7, 16) passed away from suicide. Three days after Kate Spade was Anthony Bourdain\u2019s suicide (child age 11). Is it because Kate is a mother? The loss of a parent is difficult, whether mother or father.Why is there compassion for some and not others?Let\u2019s try to connect to one another, attempt to suspend our own opinions for a moment to see through another\u2019s eyes, and empathize and support one another.We\u2019re all in this life together.How have you been a victim of mental illness stigma?==Read more by Alicia T.

I was conscious of how desensitised I had become by the sheer volume of charitable requests on my facebook feed and figured I\u2019d have to come up with something radical to make my plea for donations stand out.Already aware of the growing trend in intermittent fasting for weight loss, I began to wonder what would happen to my body if I did not eat anything for a prolonged period of time. The more I researched extended water fasting, the more excited I became about its potential to help me raise money and benefit my overall health at the same time.First I had to settle on a duration to aim for. While most fasting practitioners recommend fasts between 5 and 14 days, I found some detailed accounts of people who had fasted for as long as 45 days and lived to tell the tale. I had a holiday booked and did not want to ruin it so I settled on 22 days as this felt long enough to get some meaningful data. I always think the measure of a goal is how intimidated you feel at the thought of achieving it and this scared the shit out of me so I knew it was ambitious enough.My initial enthusiasm was quickly quashed by well meaning colleagues, friends and family members who tried to talk me out of taking on such a radical challenge.\u201cNobody can survive that long without food\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll do irreparable damage to your body\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to work\u201dBy the time I started discussing my plans with other people, I\u2019d done enough research to reassure myself that none of these doomsday prophecies were likely to materialise. Moreover, I trusted that my body would send me warning signals I was heading towards danger at any point.Frustrated that water fasting seemed to have such a bad rep I decided to take pre- and post-fast blood tests that would prove unequivocally that I was not permanently damaging my health. This made it easier to field the daily onslaught of concern as I was able to deflect futile debate by reminding people that the results of my post-fast tests would settle the argument once and for all.I know from experience that doing any kind of \u2018diet\u2019 is close to impossible for me if I am not closely tracking my progress. I was also fascinated by the plethora of claims made about the impact of fasting so I decided to track as much of my experience as possible to motivate myself and help others who consider embarking on a similar journey.There are many parameters you could track and the extent to which you engage with this depends on how inquisitive you are and how much (if anything) you want to spend. I\u2019m very health conscious anyway so I decided to go for the following:To avoid pestering my GP, I arranged my own blood tests immediately before and after the fast through home health testing startup Thriva.I weighed myself using my Withings Bodi Cardio scales every 7 days.I measured ketones and pH balance daily using urine test strips to ensure I remained within healthy ranges.I took body measurements and pictures of my progress every 7 days.Many purists in the fasting community (yes, that is a thing) will claim that you are not doing it properly unless you drink only filtered water for the duration of the fast. That seemed like a lot of hassle to me and I was not convinced that it would make a big difference so I chose to ignore it. Instead, I decided to allow myself herbal teas and 4tbs of Braggs Organic Apple Cider Vinegar each day. The latter is highly regarded by many fasters as it\u2019s packed with vitamins, minerals and enzymes that help to control your body\u2019s pH levels.There are lots of excellent and very detailed resources about how best to prepare for an extended water fast (see \u2018Further Reading\u2019 at the end of this post) so I won\u2019t bore you with the detail here. I did not prepare at all as I already restricted my sugar and carbohydrate intake. If you do eat a lot of junk it may be an idea to start with a low sugar\/carb diet for a couple of weeks to reduce the withdrawals and minimise the risk of keto flu which is extremely unpleasant. If you have any pre-existing medical conditions whatsoever you should definitely consult your GP before you fast for any period of time.I\u2019m not a doctor or fasting expert so I\u2018m not here to make claims about what is right and wrong. I can only share my own experience and it\u2019s up to you how you interpret the results.A lot of blogs I read recommended getting as much rest as possible and ideally, taking some time off work. This just was not an option for me so I decided to do my fast while going about my normal daily life.That means working 12+ hour days, 22km round-trip commutes on my bike and continuing to work out in the gym 2\u20133 times per week. I did reduce cardio intensity to ease the pressure on my heart but was able to lift as much weight as before without noticing much difference in form for the duration of the fast.Fasting is insanely hard but it does get a lot easier as your body adjusts to the new \u2018normal\u2019.During the first three days I felt like I could have fallen off the wagon at any time. The smell of food drove me wild and I started to obsess about all the things I would devour as soon as I could eat again. By the third day I was in full ketosis and experienced pounding headaches, disturbed sleep and felt light headed when standing up too quickly.At the two week mark, the uncontrollable hunger pangs and headaches were completely gone. My blood pressure was still lower than usual which explains why I felt light-headed and freezing cold at times. I was able to handle and cook food for my boyfriend without feeling tempted and found the smell of junk and sugar laden snacks repulsive.Week three was surprisingly easy compared to weeks one and two. I suspect this is due to the body adjusting to the new \u2018normal\u2019 and the fact that I had purged most of the toxins in my system at this point which is said to significantly reduce unpleasant and flu-like side effects.Physically and mentally, I felt in the shape of my life.Don\u2019t believe me? Let\u2019s take a look at the data:As you can see, the results are astonishing. Far from causing irreparable damage to my health, my extended fast had a profound impact on my vital health stats.The values highlighted in orange were classified as suboptimal by the good doctors at Thriva. That is to say that while I was not in immediate danger, my pre-fast test results indicated abnormalities that were a cause for concern.The values highlighted in green indicate a return to \u2018healthy\u2019 levels in the areas where results were previously in the unhealthy range. Most notably, my liver function and cholesterol bounced right back to well within the healthy zone.Naturally, I expected to lose weight on a diet of water and herbal tea but I never expected such wide-ranging improvements across the board.I embarked on this journey believing that the only positive side effects would be weight loss + money raised for charity. I was wrong!Extended fasting is ultimately a test of determination, will power and grit. Completing such a tough personal challenge did not only improve my physical wellbeing but also boosted my self belief and fine tuned my self awareness.I now believe that the \u20183 meals per day\u2019 lifestyle we have all become used to is nothing more than a social construct. Our hunter gatherer forefathers did not have the luxury of cornflakes on waking followed by a Boots meal deal at lunch and deliveroo for dinner. I no longer think we \u2018need\u2019 this either.6 months on from breaking my fast, I have managed to maintain my post-fast weight (with the exception of a small amount of water gain). I fast intermittently each day (no food between 9pm and noon the following day) which helps me achieve razor sharp focus on difficult tasks first thing in the morning. I try to avoid refined carbohydrates and sugar in favour of complex carbs, healthy fats and proteins.Above all, I trust my body to let me know when it\u2019s time to eat.If you appreciate the time and effort it has taken to conduct this \u2018experiment\u2019 why not make a small donation to my favourite charity?You can donate and learn more about this cause on my JustGiving PageA guide to water fasting: https:\/\/www.natural-health-zone.com\/water-fasting.htmlIs fasting the secret to longer life: http:\/\/www.menshealth.co.uk\/food-nutrition\/does-fasting-make-you-live-longerWater fasting benefits and dangers: https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/nutrition\/water-fastingIf you found this essay insightful, I\u2019d massively appreciate you recommending to friends and colleagues.Really good read?

The President of the Kripalu Center for Health and Wellness was giving a lecture on yoga and integrated functioning of the body and mind. As words like \u201cdopamine serotonin beta blockers\u201d and \u201cbioneurology\u201d were thrown around to a room full of seekers on a spiritual path, I wondered what on earth any of these things had to do with my stretching and meditation practice. As the lecture progressed, however, it became apparent that the theory of the mind-body connection \u2014 a state often accessed and explored through yoga \u2014 and its increasing scientific validity is more far reaching than I could have ever imagined.As the story goes, yoga postures as we know them today are actually snapshots of ancient yogic energetic rituals. Yogis would respond to the built up energy force (prana) in their bodies and would practice erratic dance as a means to honor and surrender to their inner goings on. Coupled with this practice, was meditation \u2014 in which they would sit sometimes for days on end in order to achieve union with the divine. To prepare the body for this sustained meditation, \u201csnapshots\u201d of the pranic release dances would be used as poses that the yogis would hold to develop the flexibility and strength \u2014 both mental and physical \u2014 to be able to sit in meditation for prolonged periods of time. In the deeper history of yoga, the principle behind the practice was that yoga would serve to unify the mind and body, bringing each back to its natural state, achieving balance and possibly, the ability to heal itself.When one steps onto the yoga mat and begins their practice, more often than not they expect to be stretched (literally) to their maximum physical capacity. In practicing yoga, one begins to find him or herself with increased flexibility, strength and even pain relief. Meditation is often partnered with an asana (posture) practice in a classroom setting and as one travels down an Eastern inspired spiritual path, yoga and meditation go hand in hand. After a prolonged commitment to practice, the benefits of a spiritual practice begin to manifest themselves in ways that go beyond the physical: learning to quiet the mind and help with stressful situations, an ability to stay \u201cpresent\u201d from moment to moment, becoming more aware of oneself, feelings, emotions \u2014 a unification of body, mind and spirit. Various studies have taken the benefits of yoga a step further, into the health & wellness realm and claim (among others) the following benefits: pulse rate decreases, sleep improves, total cholesterol decreases, depth perception improves, hemoglobin increases, excretory functions improve, triglycerides decrease.As yoga can be literally translated as \u201cunion\u201d, its effects of unity on the entire person can begin to make sense however, why and how does physical motion unified with breathing techniques yield effects on our minds? Does it work both ways \u2014 do our minds somehow exert a measurable influence on our physical well-being? According to research in mind-body medicine, the answer is \u201cyes\u201d.Take, for example, the phenomenon known as the \u2018placebo effect\u2019. This is an act where an individual receives the expected result of an experience merely by its given expectation \u2014 a testament to the power of mind to influence our physiology. The branch of medicine that studies the relationship between the brain and the immune system is referred to as Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI). It offers a way of looking at the whole of a person, the integrated functioning of the body and its interaction with its environment in order to study, prevent and cure disease. PNI examines the chemical ways that the various systems of our bodies communicate with each other. As its name would imply, it brings together knowledge and specialists from various branches of the medical field, more specifically and especially endocrinology, immunology, psychology and neurology. While a lot of research in medicine tends to focus on advancements in the more seemingly impressive arena, such as heart transplants or pharmaceutical breakthroughs, research on the mind body interconnection has a rich history and continues to provide new information.The term \u2018psychoneuroimmunology\u2019 was first coined by Robert Ader and Nicholas Cohen at the University of Rochester in the 1970\u2019s. Similar to the Pavlonian study of dogs salivating at the ring of a bell, Ader and Cohen conducted research on rats relating to the immune system. They fed the rats saccharine infused water, first laced with Cytoxan (a nausea inducer) which caused the rats to become ill. Later, when the Cytoxan was removed from the water, but the saccharine was still present, the rats exhibited the same symptoms \u2014 nausea, lethargy \u2014 showing that after conditioning, the immune system was still affected by the nervous system.Taking this research a step further, Dr. Candace Pert emerged. Dr. Pert\u2019s studies first focused on neuropeptide receptors in the brain and immune system. After discovering the endorphin and the opiate receptor, Dr. Pert went on to identify receptors not only in the brain, but in our body organs, muscles and glands. A network of nerves was discovered that led to blood vessels and cells of the immune system. Ascribing the cells of each individual area with the gift of \u201cmuscle memory\u201d \u2014 or their own intelligence \u2014 she claims that the body IS the subconscious mind. Dr. Pert uses Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) as an example of the power of mind over body. In some cases of MPD, actual physical characteristics may change with the personality \u2014 for example one personality may have perfect vision, while another may need an eyeglass prescription. If MPD, as classically perceived, is just an affliction of the mind, how might the issue of a change in visual ability be explained? It would seem that further exploration of the mind, body and its biochemical interactions is completely warranted.By this logic, one can deduct that sensory input, once \u201cinside our body\u201d is converted to a chemical which kicks off a process in which the chemical binds to the receptors throughout the body, at which point we may begin to develop a corresponding emotion, even experiencing a physical manifestation of the sensory experience. In short, she is saying that emotions are the link between the mind and the body. Claiming that we are \u201chard wired for bliss\u201d, she took it a step further and tied spirituality in to the existing study of mind-body dynamics. Dr. Pert claims that health and longevity have a positive correlation to our awareness and perception. Meditation is a method she cites as contributing to the development of these attributes. Meditation, like yoga, comes from the Eastern view of physical wellness where consciousness is seen as the \u201cultimate reality\u201d. This is in stark contrast to the Western view which seems to imply that consciousness is a by-product of existence, or something that we need to develop or tap in to. Through meditation, we learn to quiet our minds. In doing so, we familiarize ourselves with the nothingness state of mind and are that much more sensitive and aware of the way we are converting our sensory input. Over time, with a dedicated practice, meditation teaches us to control our thought patterns, potentially reducing our absorption of negative emotion, which could physically manifest itself in the body. By becoming aware of and controlling our emotional and mental states, we may be able to maintain optimum health and heal more quickly from ailments. Based on continuing research, the integration of the known and unknown in order to understand the human body as a holistic mechanism might be the reality of the direction of modern medicine.Written byWritten by","7029":"There have been two main changes in dietary habits from the 1970s (before the obesity epidemic) until today. First, there was the change is what we were recommended to eat. Prior to 1970, there was no official government sanctioned dietary advice. You ate what your mother told you to eat. With the publication of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, we were told to cut the fat in our diets way down and replace that with carbohydrates, which might have been OK if it was all broccoli and kale, but might not be OK if it was all white bread and sugar.But the other major change was in when we eat. There were no official recommendations on this, but nevertheless, eating patterns changed significantly, and I believe contributed equally to the obesity crisis. From the NHANES study in 1977, most people ate was 3 times per day \u2014 breakfast, lunch and dinner. I grew up in the 1970s. There were no snacks. If you wanted an after school snack, your mom said \u201cNo, you\u2019ll ruin your dinner\u201d. If you wanted an bedtime snack, she just said \u201cNo\u201d. Snacking was not considered either necessary or healthy. It was a treat, to be taken only very occasionally.By 2004, the world had changed. Most people were now eating almost 6 times per day. It is almost considered child abuse to deprive your child of a mid-morning snack or after school snack. If they play soccer, it somehow became necessary to give them juice and cookies between the halves. We run around chasing our kids to eat cookies and drink juice, and then wonder why we have a childhood obesity crisis. Good job, everybody, good job. Without any science to back it up, many nutritional authorities endorsed eating multiple times per day as a healthy practice. There were no studies that remotely suggested this was true. It was likely the successful efforts of snack food company advertising to dieticians, and doctors, clueless about nutrition at the best of times, who simply went along for the ride.This was not merely an American phenomenon. More recently, China has followed in America\u2019s footsteps with increased snacking. Large scale surveys show that from 1991 to 2009, the percentage of children and adults who regularly snack has skyrocketed. Children aged 13\u201318 went from 8.7% snacking to 46.3% snacking \u2014 a more than 5 fold increase. Adults showed the a similar rise from 8.7% to 35.6%. So what, right? Who cares?Hello Chinese obesity crisis. Along with this increase is a huge increase in the prevalence of diabetes in China.Recently Satchin Panda did an interesting study on current eating habits, tracked via a smartphone app. The 10% of people who ate the least frequently, ate 3.3 times per day. That is, 90% of people ate more than 3.3 times per day. The top 10% of people ate an astounding 10 times per day. Essentially, we started eating as soon as we got up, and didn\u2019t stop until we went to bed.The median daily intake duration (the amount of time people spent eating) was 14.75 hours per day. That is, if you started eating breakfast at 8 am, you didn\u2019t, on average, stop eating until 10:45! Practically the only time people stopped eating was while sleeping. This contrasts with a 1970\u2019s era style of eating at 8am breakfast and dinner at 6pm, giving a rough eating duration of only 10 hours. The \u2018feedogram\u2019 shows no let up in eating until after 11pm. There was also a noticeable bias towards late night eating, as many people are not hungry in the morning. An estimated 25% of calories are taken before noon, but 35% after 6pm.When those overweight individuals eating more than 14 hours per day were simply instructed to curtail their eating times to only 10\u201311 hours, they lost weight (average 7.2 pounds) and felt better even though they were not instructed to overtly change whatthey ate, only whenthey ate.This has huge metabolic consequences. A fascinating study was recently published directly comparing a regular eating schedule to an optimized time restricted feeding schedule.. Both intermittent fasting and time restricted eating tend to produce some reduction in food intake, and therefore it is never clear whether the benefits of these strategies are due to timing (when to eat) or food intake (what to eat).The circadian rhythm, as I\u2019ve discussed previously, suggests that late night eating is not optimal for weight loss. This is because excessive insulin is the main driver of obesity, and eating the same food early in the day or late at night have different insulin effects. Indeed, studies of time restricted eating mostly show benefits from reducing late night eating. So it makes sense to combine two strategies of meal timing (circadian considerations and time restricted eating) into one optimal strategy of eating only over a certain period of the day, and only during the early daytime period. Researchers called this the eTRF (early Time Restricted Feeding) strategy.This was a randomized crossover, isocaloric and eucaloric study. That is, all patients did both arms of the study eating the same foods and the same calories and then compared against themselves. The two arms of the study were eating between 8am and 8pm, and the eTRF strategy of eating between 8 am and 2pm, but remember, both groups ate 3 meals per day of the same foods. Some would start with the conventional diet, then cross over to eTRF, and others did the opposite, separated by 7 weeks washout period. Subjects were men with prediabetes.The benefits were huge. Mean insulin levels dropped significantly, and insulin resistance dropped as well. Insulin is a driver of obesity, so merely changing the meal timing and restricting the number of hours you ate, and also by moving to an earlier eating schedule produced huge benefits even in the same person eating the same meals. That\u2019s astounding. Even more remarkable was that even after the washout period of 7 weeks, the eTRF group maintainedlower insulin levels at baseline. The benefits were maintained even after stopping the time restriction. Blood pressure dropped as well.But won\u2019t the time restricted feeding group be more hungry? Sure they might be skinnier, but their poor stomachs are growling for food in the evening, right? No pain, no gain. Incredibly, it was the opposite. Those people who restricted late night eating had LESS desire to eat, but also less capacity to eat. They couldn\u2019t eat more at night even if they wanted to! That\u2019s amazing, because now we are working with our body to lose weight instead of constantly fighting it. It is obviously easier to restrict eating in the evening if you are not hungry.Somewhat counterintuitively, restricting eating at 2 pm produced more feelings of fullness in the evening. Some other important lessons learned is that there is an adaptation period to this method of eating. It took participants 12 days on average to adjust to this way of eating. So don\u2019t start this eTRF strategy and decide it didn\u2019t work for you after a couple of days. It can take up to 3 or 4 weeks to adjust. Most found the fasting period relatively easy to adhere to, but more difficult to adjust to the time restriction.That is, it\u2019s not hard to fast for 16 or 18 hours. But eating dinner at 2 pm is tough. Given the modern schedule of working or school during the day, we tend to push our main meal into the evenings. The main family meal together is dinner, and this is ingrained into us. So, I\u2019m not saying this is an easy task, but it may certainly have a number of metabolic benefits. Having a fasting support group, such as the IDM membership community, can certainly help. Fasting aids, such as green tea, coffee or bone broth can also help (although some would not consider that a true fast).But the bottom line is this. We focus nearly obsessively on the question of \u2018What to Eat\u2019. Should I eat avocados or steak? Should I eat quinoa or pasta? Should I eat more fat? Should I eat less fat? Should I eat less protein? Should I eat more protein? Let\u2019s face it, the answer changes every few years, according to who you ask.But an equally important question lies almost completely unanswered. What effect does meal timing have on obesity and other metabolic parameters? Quite a lot, it turns out. Having a well defined fasting period is likely very important. The strategy of eTRF, and intermittent fasting more generally now gives exhausted dieters a new hope.Written byWritten by","7125":"Avocados serve as a versatile addition to a wide range of recipes, as a quick look online will show! Regular avocado consumption also tends to boost diet quality compared to the recommended American diet by increasing fibre, magnesium, potassium and fat-soluble vitamin intake [1].More than just Tasty Salad, Salsa and Guacamole. Eating avocado has great \u201cside-effects\u201d. An experiment that measured the amount of vitamins absorbed from a salad showed that adding avocados increased \u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lutein and lycopene absorption [2]. Adding avocado oil alone to the salad also increased the absorption of these nutrients. Avocado has also been shown to increase \u03b1- and \u03b2-carotene absorption, as well as vitamin A levels, when added to tomato sauce and raw carrot dishes [3]. Whereas there is not direct experimental evidence, the chemical responsible for many health benefits in chillies (i.e. capsaicin) is also soluble in oil, and so it\u2019s possible that avocado may boost all the benefits we receive from spicy food. As such, it appears the fat\/oil content of avocados is able to increase the nutritional quality of a whole range of plant-based dishes.\u201cFatty nutrients\u201d for the Heart. Lycopene is a red-pigmented molecule found in tomato, carrots, potatoes, papaya and other fruit and veg. Lycopene is a potent antioxidant that can lower the risk of depression [4] and give significant protection from prostate cancer [5]. A review of the literature has shown that dietary lycopene direct from food is much more effective (than other forms) at lowering blood pressure and inflammation, and improves endothelial function [6]. All of those factors protect against cardiovascular disease. The same phenomenon has been shown for most known antioxidants; fruits and veg are the only way to eat antioxidants that work [7, 8, 9].Food for Thought. Avocado is a rich source of the pigment lutein that our bodies concentrate in the macular pigments of our brains [10]. After 6 months, eating avocados regularly was able to not just elevate circulating levels of lutein in the bloodstream, but boost lutein content of the macular pigment and actually improve memory, attention and problem solving [10].Fatty ingredients against the Heart. Cholesterol is a fatty molecule usually present in an omnivorous diet but practically absent in a vegan\/plant-based diet. Interestingly enough, the body produces it\u2019s own cholesterol in the liver, a process that is inhibited by the drug \u201csimvastatin\u201d [11]. Cholesterol predominantly circulates in the body in the more commonly known forms of \u201cgood cholesterol\u201d and \u201cbad cholesterol\u201d (actually HDL and LDL respectively). LDL distributes cholesterol from the liver into circulation in the bloodstream so that relevant tissues and organs can use cholesterol properly. But when LDL is oxidised, by an \u201clow antioxidant\u201d omnivorous diet for example, cholesterol becomes a problem and can block the bloodstream [12]. This is why an \u201cantioxidant-rich\u201d plant-based diet can reverse many heart and circulatory illnesses [13].Avocado Aficionado. The fat content that makes up 15% of an avocado\u2019s weight is mostly the healthy kind (i.e. over 70% mono- and poly-unsaturated fat) [14]. A review of the benefits of eating avocado indicated that eating avocados on a regular basis can significantly improved the cholesterol profile of patients with diabetes, those with inherited high cholesterol, and people eating a calorie-restricted diet [14]. Since the fatty vitamins that avocados help us absorb are antioxidants (i.e. lycopene, carotene etc.), the benefits that avocado aficionados experience makes perfect sense! Fatty antioxidants are likely to circulate the body and help protect LDL from oxidation, or possibly reverse LDL oxidation.Although many \u201crefined\u201d vegetable oils are also able to increase the body\u2019s absorption of fatty nutrients [15], your arteries may not appreciate it [16]. Avocados offer a higher-quality conduit to boost absorption of all these fatty vitamins, but in theory could potentially deliver fat-soluble toxins that often concentrate in \u201comnivorous foods\u201d [17] (avocados delivering food-borne pollutants has not been researched directly). The best possible approach to extracting the most nutrients possible from your foods is to add avocado to salads and other plant based meals.Disclaimer: If you have medical concerns, please consult your doctor before implementing the opinions in this article.N.

It takes attitude changes and pressurized reality to learn how to balance between \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cme.\u201dWhen we travel by plane, we\u2019re used to hearing the flight attendant\u2019s safety instructions. He or she usually says something like this.\u201cIf there\u2019s a loss of cabin pressure, the panels above your seat will open, and oxygen masks will drop down. . . Be sure to adjust your own mask before helping others.\u201dIf we attempt to help others before adjusting our own mask, we may end up passing out. Then we can\u2019t help anyone. We need to take that same advice for our relationships. We need to care for our own soul-needs before attempting to care for others.Marriages are like a pressurized cabin at various times. They are not so even-keeled. We experience turbulence and high altitudes. Storms and fair weather affect our differences. Our ears pop. The ride gets rough. We\u2019re required to stay in our seats with seatbelt securely fastened at times.Early on in romance, our differences are exciting, novel, and energizing. After marriage, and sometimes before, our differences can become outright annoying. That\u2019s when they can escalate into major conflicts.Other life transitions expose the soul storms of a marriage. Raising children, career development, loss, and core differences create turbulence in life. But we can get beyond messy marriages.Many Christian couples vow, \u201cThe two of us are one.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take long to realize one or both are subconsciously saying things like this.We two are one. And yes, I\u2019m the one.Or, in a patriarchal or what some consider a \u201cbiblical\u201d marriage, a bride may live her life like this.We two are one. And, yes, he\u2019s the one.As years go by, both lose opportunities to develop their character. They lose their individual selves as well as the relationship. One of them becomes invisible. The other one gets caught up in self-dellusions. Neither has insights into their own souls.Neither one attempts to adjust their own oxygen mask. They\u2019re too busy trying to improve, fix, or help the other. They become bitter, resentful, angry and resistant. Their world gets smaller. They become stuck. Or, figuratively, they pass out.It takes two to honor each other and respect one another\u2019s differences. And it still takes two to do that in a relationship. Here\u2019s points to consider.World-renown researcher, Dr. John Gottman, gives us clarity. Sixty-nine percent of happily married couples have unresolved conflict. The difference between the \u201cmasters\u201d and the \u201cdisasters\u201d are this. The \u201cmasters\u201d are the ones who adjust and accept their partner\u2019s differences.

Under the guise of \u2018Evidence Based Medicine\u2019 the public has been sold fraudulent goods, and the result is that people suffer from unnecessary but lucrative procedures and take unnecessary but lucrative medications. Let me explain. Much of the data we use in medicine comes from epidemiology studies \u2014 where one thing is associated with another. It is easy to prove association, but much harder to prove that one thing causes the other, which is what we want to know.It is very dangerous to accept data from epidemiologic studies because there are too many confounding factors. That is how we wound up with millions of women prescribed hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which turned out to be giving them cancer. In the late 1990s, there was a very strong association between women taking HRT and reduction of heart disease \u2014 about a 50% reduction. Based on this flimsy evidence, millions of women were prescribed the drug. It turns out, that when the trials were finally completed a decade or so later, that HRT did NOT reduce heart disease at all. Instead, women who took HRT were also healthier in many other ways \u2014 and these confounding factors accounted for the apparent heart disease risk reduction.It further turns out that HRT was giving women breast cancer. When prescribing of HRT increased through the 1980s and 1990s, breast cancer also increased. But tellingly, when HRT decreased around year 2000, breast cancer also decreased by 6.7%. Almost nothing in medicine causes this type of sustained decrease in cancer, and the implication is that HRT caused cancer in millions of women. The worst part is that it was the DOCTORS that caused all these cancers, by widely prescribing a lucrative medication based only on flimsy evidence and lots of encouragement by drug companies. The problem is not the drug company, which will always do whatever it can do push its drugs. The companies duty is to make money for shareholders, not to safeguard the public. The problem is that the doctors and the universities have financial conflicts of interest by taking millions of $$$ from these companies. The duty of doctors and universities is to guard the public health and to scientific truth \u2014 which is much harder when all your funding comes from companies that have vested interests in proving benefits. Doctors and universities, and everybody else in the world knows that you don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you.The New York Times reported on the recent CABANA trialof catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Once again, a highly invasive but lucrative procedure became widespread based on no evidence at all. But wide promotion by device companies led many doctors to inflict this on unknowing but trusting patients. How are we to protect against this? This is where evidence based medicine is supposed to shine, but demanding randomized trials to prove that certain procedures\/ drugs either work or don\u2019t. Great, right? Well, not so much. The problem is when all of these trials are paid for by industry, then the evidence is severely biased. If the evidence base is biased, then evidence based medicine is completely worthless. It\u2019s one thing to say that Harvard researcher prove that XYZ drug cures cancer. We might believe this. But, it\u2019s another thing to say that XYZ drug maker proves that their drug cures cancer. In this case, almost none of us believe it. The solution, if you are XYZ drug maker? Simple. Pay Harvard researchers millions of $$$ to do a study, but bias it so severely that it is a virtual certainty that XYZ drug looks like it works. Then claim that it was the Harvard researcher who proved XYZ drug cures cancer.It\u2019s a win-win-win situation. XYZ drug maker is happy to have \u2018evidence\u2019 that \u2018proves\u2019 their drug works. Harvard is happy with all the $$$. Researcher is happy with all the $$$ and the prestige of \u2018proving\u2019 the drug works. It actually matters almost not at all if the drug actually works or not. It\u2019s fantastically easy to design a trial and rig the results as we\u2019ll soon see. The only loser? Public health \u2014 it spends money on useless or dangerous medications and people die. No biggie for the universities and doctors lining their pockets.The New York Times recently published an article describing how the NIH, the top American government health research agency pulled the plug on a $100 million trial. This study was supposed to answer the question of whether moderate alcohol intake is beneficial for health. It\u2019s a great question, because much epidemiological data supports this hypothesis, but this data can only be considered hypothesis generating and not definitive. So the NIH decided to do a randomized trial on this to settle the question. But, the researchers from Harvard got all the money from alcohol companies. Five large beer companies, like Carlsberg agreed to foot most of the bill for the trial.This is crazy, and obviously puts researchers in conflict, because if they are funded by beer companies, then they will be much, much more likely to find results favourable to them. Consider the case in sugar sweetened beverages. When reviewing all the trials that linked sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) to obesity, researchers found 60 published articles.26 of the articles found there was no association, and 34 found a positive association \u2014 ie. that sugar was linked to obesity. Pretty close, right? If you didn\u2019t know about conflicts of interest, then you would think that it\u2019s equivocal whether sugar causes obesity or not. What if we were to show which papers were funded by the sugar industry?This is what you find. 25 of the 26 (96.2%) papers showing that sugar is NOT linked to obesity were funded by the sugar industry! When you look at the papers that suggested sugar WAS linked to obesity, only 1 of the 34 (2.9%) was funded by the sugar industry. The \u2018scientific\u2019 result was based almost entirely on who pays the researchers. University professors and doctors have sold their scientific opinions and integrity to the highest bidder. For example, researchers at the University of Toronto, like Dr. John Sievenpiper are regularly trotted out in the national media saying that sugar is practically a health food. It turns out that his group receives millions of $$$to have this opinion. It sure sounds a lot better to say that \u2018Doctors at the University of Toronto say sugar not linked to obesity\u2019 that \u2018Sugar company research shows that sugar not linked to obesity\u2019.The same goes for medications. Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a UK cardiologist made headlineswriting a paper describing one of the most insidious problems in modern medicine \u2014 too much prescription medicine, driven mainly by biased research. Statin medications are one of the most lucrative drug classes of the last 20 years. But almost all trials of these medications have been funded extensively by the companies themselves. Problem? It\u2019s an open secret that doctors and universities are paid millions of $$$ to perform these trials, which then show that statins are the best thing since sliced bread.Where there any non-drug-company funded trials on statins? Sure. The ALLHAT study, enrolling more than 10,000 patients showed that taking pravastatin did NOT reduce heart disease. Interestingly, this study is all but forgotten in all the drug company driven advertising to doctors about how statins are so amazingly good for health that they should be practically considered vitamin S. Virtually all drug funded studies show statins save lives. The only major non-drug funded study shows it makes little or no difference in primary prevention.These financial conflicts of interest are not merely academic musings. People die. Take the opioid crisis for example. Drug companies paid lots of money to doctors to prescribe opioids. People got addicted, and many died. CNN showedthat a group of doctors who received over $10,000 from the opioid company prescribed $1.2 million worth of drugs, compared to doctors who received less than $20 from drug companies prescribed only $34,000.The solution is really very simply. Eliminate all financial conflicts of interest in research. That is, if a researcher works for Harvard then it is paid by Harvard, not by the drug company. If Harvard researchers want to publish a study, then it should be funded by Harvard, not some drug company that pays millions of $$$ to get a great result. If you work for a university, you should not be allowed to receive any money from anybody else. These rules are in place for almost every other profession. But for research and medicine, taking money from the highest bidder is not only allowed, it is standard operating procedure.There will be those who argue that there will be no money for research. I say, so what? That supposes that biased research is better than none at all. That is rather like arguing that a corrupt policeman is better than none at all. I would rather have no research than biased ones.Written byWritten by","7263":"We often talk about ayurvedic powders for their benefits on the hair but they are also very effective for your skin!Ayurveda, what is it?For those who do not know Ayurveda, this is an ancient Indian tradition combining medicine and philosophy.

Buddhist priests carried the tea drinking tradition to Japan. Even in ancient times, tea was believed to have many medicinal qualities. In 1211 AD, the Japanese Zen priest Yeisai published the book \u2018Kitcha-Yojoki\u2019 which translated to \u2018Tea and Health Promotion\u2019. At the time, civil war had broken out and tea drinking was all but forgotten for two centuries. With peace restored, Yeisai reintroduced the tea plant to Japan. He wrote about methods of harvesting, production, and also it\u2019s many healthful attributes. He proclaimed that tea was a \u201cdivine remedy and a supreme gift of heaven\u201d. Where before tea drinking was restricted to nobility and priests, tea drinking now spread to the general population. When the Shogun Sanetomo became ill from over-feasting, he summoned Yeisai to offer prayers. The Buddhist abbott supplemented his prayers with tea, and after recovery, the shogun became a great tea devotee. Modern medicine is just now catching up to this ancient wisdom regarding tea\u2019s health benefits.Obesity and the closely related type 2 diabetes significantly increase the risk of death and heart disease. Green tea contains many chemical compounds that may play a role in reducing the burden of disease. Some studies have shown benefit in adding green tea compounds to the diet as opposed to oolong tea that contains lower levels of catechins, the chemicals thought to be effective for weight loss. In one experiment, patients were assigned to two different beverages \u2014 oolong tea compared to an enriched green tea. Oolong tea is made from the same tea leaves, but the fermentation process changes many of the catechins to theaflavins instead. Oolong tea is the most widely sold tea in Japan. The green tea contains larger amounts of catechins, but this amount was enriched by concentrating some of the catechins.After a period of 12 weeks, there was a noticeable difference in body weight, with the green tea group losing an extra 1.1 kg compared to the oolong group. There were other benefits, too. Waist size decreased 3.4 cm in the green tea group compared to only 1.6 cm in the oolong group. This abdominal obesity is far more injurious to human health than overall body weight, and therefore the criteria for metabolic syndrome are based on waist circumference, not body mass index.The effect of reducing body fat and waist circumference would also be expected to have a beneficial effect on reducing type 2 diabetes. Indeed, the same researchers as the first study undertook a 2009 study to determine the effects of a catechin enriched green tea in a randomized placebo controlled trial in type 2 diabetic patients who were not taking insulin.The results were simply spectacular. Body weight was largely unchanged between the two groups, but the waist circumference, indicative of the more dangerous abdominal fat was reduced by 3.3 cm in the catechin group but not in the placebo. Systolic blood pressure was reduced by 5.9 mmHG and diastolic by 3.0 mmHG in the catechin group. Triglycerides improved by over 10%. This improved metabolic profile was confirmed by the blood testing which showed reduced blood glucose and hemoglobin A1C, a sort of 3 month average of blood glucose measurements. In the catechin group, A1C was lowered by 0.37, almost as powerful as some of the medications used today for treatment of diabetes.This beneficial effect was also found in several other studies. A 2006 study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine known as the JACC (Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk) followed over 16,000 subjects with a mean age of 53 years and body mass index of 22.7 (normal weight). Consumption of green tea and coffee were both protective against the development of type 2 diabetes, whereas oolong and black tea did not show these benefits. Both green tea and coffee drinking afforded about a 30\u201340% decreased risk. Other epidemiological studies have shown similar benefits for coffee drinking.The MEDIS study studied 1,190 elderly patients in the Mediterranean Islands of Greece, Cyprus and Crete. Once again, moderate (1\u20132 cups) long term consumption of green tea significantly reduce levels of blood glucose. In these elderly people with a high risk of disease, the consumption of 1 additional cup of tea per day was associated with a 70% lower likelihood of developing diabetes.This improvement in metabolic syndrome would be expected to have dividends for heart disease, which we\u2019ve discussed previously. As well, we see these benefits in prevention of stroke, as well.Despite wide variation in tea consumption and across 6 countries, there was a consistent beneficial association between tea drinking and risk of stroke. Subjects who drank 3 or more cups of tea per day had a 21% reduced risk of stroke. There are three main mechanisms of protection theorized. First, catechins help to lower blood pressure, a key risk factor for stroke. Second, tea drinking may be beneficial for endothelial function (discussed previously), the interface between blood vessels and blood flow that is so important for atherosclerosis. The third possible benefit involves theanine, an amino acid found in high concentrations in tea leaves coming almost exclusively from that source. Theanine is easily absorbed into the body, crosses the blood brain barrier, and may help protect against damage from stroke. Tea drinking may help turn minor strokes into undetectable ones.CancerMost of the data regarding green tea and cancer comes from animal studies, which is interesting but not definitive. EGCG, the main catechin in green tea is able to prevent metastasis by blocking the adhesion of cancer cells to the endothelial layer. Cancer cells often depend upon a matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in order to metastasize, and EGCG has been shown to inhibit MMP-2 and MMP-9. In isolated cell studies, this helps block metastasis of cancer.The other major pathway where green tea catechins may benefit is in the induction of apoptosis(programmed cell death). EGCG binds to the death ligand to activate the mitochondrial pathway. Once activated, the cell dies and never has a chance to become cancerous.Small epidemiological studies seem to suggest a benefit for stomach cancer in Japan, but overall studies have been equivocal.These benefits are likely quite small, but the risks are equally small. Given the relatively low cost of drinking tea, this makes tea drinking, along with fasting, one of the cheapest and most powerful biohacks.Written byWritten by","7332":"In case you haven\u2019t noticed, human beings are obsessed with being busy. If we\u2019re not at work or in class, we\u2019re doing our homework, playing sports, going to events, partying with friends, attending meetings, making dinner, watching Netflix, singing, dancing, reading\u2026the list goes on.Even if we\u2019re in a situation where there doesn\u2019t immediately seem like there\u2019s much else we can do, we manage to squeeze things in. When you\u2019re on the bus, you can\u2019t just be on the bus \u2014 you\u2019re texting, listening to music, playing Candy Crush, watching Buzzfeed videos, listening to a podcast, or reading a book. There aren\u2019t too many instances in the average day for most human beings when we allow our minds to be completely unoccupied by an action \u2014 in fact, I would argue that such moments simply don\u2019t exist in many lives.Our infatuation with being busy is likely the byproduct of many powerful forces \u2014 two that immediately come to mind are the rise of capitalism throughout the planet, accompanied by the Industrial Revolution. With more efficient production comes more consumption, and keeping up with more consumption means more production. The goal for many societies simply became more \u2014 more shopping, more working, more television, more, more, more.Efficiency became the mantra; the more things we could do and the faster we could do them, the better. It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, then, that societies in many parts of the world have a negative perception of the concept of \u201cboredom\u201d \u2014 the word itself has grown to have a negative connotation in everyday conversation.If someone says that they\u2019re bored, they\u2019re urged to pick up a book, take up a new hobby or learn something new \u2014 to be productive, and to \u201cdo something with your life\u201d. You simply can\u2019t do nothing. But if our minds are never allowed the chance to wander into the unknown, how will we ever know what they\u2019re fully capable of creating?I speak as if I\u2019m the ultimate guru when it comes to allowing one\u2019s mind to wander off, but I thought of writing about this topic precisely because I suck at it. Whether I\u2019m on the bus, walking somewhere, going to bed \u2014 heck, even when I\u2019m brushing my teeth, I\u2019m listening to music. If I see a window in my schedule, it\u2019s definitely being filled with something I\u2019ve been meaning to do for a while. If that doesn\u2019t pan out, watch me create a task that, all of a sudden, demands my immediate time and energy.I became acutely aware of this issue (and I do believe that it\u2019s an issue) when I began to really question why I take long showers on the weekends (unsurprisingly, this train of thought began when I was in the shower a couple of days ago). It\u2019s not like I particularly enjoy it; if anything, I just end up annoyed with myself for using way more water than I needed to. I realized that it\u2019s one of the few parts of my day \u2014 scratch that, my week \u2014 when I\u2019m not occupied by anything else, mostly because I\u2019m not really in a position to.I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that many of my thoughts and ideas also come up during this time. I\u2019ve programmed my brain to be constantly occupied with a task to be completed or a destination to arrive at, so in those rare moments when I release it from the cage that is the confines of my immediate schedule and into its own, mostly unexplored land, it often comes back with gold nuggets of inspiration.And I wouldn\u2019t even consider this fully letting my mind wander \u2014 taking a shower isn\u2019t exactly \u201cdoing nothing\u201d. Who knows what would come out of just lying down or going for a walk \u2014 no music, no podcasts, no phone calls \u2014 and allowing my mind to explore what lies beyond the day-to-day thoughts that consume it?A human being\u2019s time and attention have become increasingly valuable resources in today\u2019s world. Our species has the same 24 hours in a day, but the sheer volume of \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 stuff that can occupy those 24 hours has grown exponentially. Everywhere we turn, media, advertisements, businesses, causes and other human beings beckon us towards their seemingly important purposes. With this comes the increasing pressure to engage in anything and everything the world has to offer \u2014 it becomes easy to feel left out or not \u201cup to date\u201d with the world if you don\u2019t.But I invite you to turn away from the growing din of the outside world, and make room in your life for simply doing nothing. It\u2019s different from having \u201cme time\u201d, which still includes engaging in some sort of (albeit relaxing) activity. Allowing your mind to wander means fully unplugging and disengaging from distractions. You never know what your mind might find in the lands, valleys and oceans of your inner world that it is yet to explore.Thanks so much for reading!

And the funny thing is, those of us who turn to things like meditation and yoga and related practices are doing it because we\u2019re stressed and anxious and most of us are not anticipating any cure for it \u2014 we just want to manage. I\u2019m not really the \u201czen\u201d type. But that\u2019s why I do all that.Most days, that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do. Manage. I write about wellness and self improvement but I\u2019m so far from perfect, and I\u2019ll never get to \u201cperfect,\u201d anyway, so that\u2019s not what I\u2019m aiming for.And sometimes all of the wrong things actually work. Like, last week, I was sleeping on a cot in a hallway, in an AirBnb in some unfamiliar neighborhood in Atlanta. Eating like shit, drinking, spending too much on Ubers, no morning routine \u2014 and I was happy. I wasn\u2019t anxious. I was content.And some weeks I do everything right and I still don\u2019t feel right. Life is weird. \u201cWellness\u201d is hard to pin down.I don\u2019t quite know what I\u2019m trying to say here. Just don\u2019t get bogged down in the bullshit, I guess. Because most of us are just stumbling around without a clue, and I don\u2019t write about wellness and health and personal development to preach or condescend anyone. I just need to get my thoughts out of my head to make sense of things.Written byWritten by","7360":"You\u2019ve been focused, smart and dedicated. You\u2019re on your way to what seems like an ideal goal snapping up other mini goals along the way. People praise you, promote you and tell you that you are indispensable. You\u2019re in the game.But something\u2019s not right. You are awake when you ought to be asleep and when you do sleep it\u2019s far from sound. When you do catch up with friends who are happy to meet you around your schedule your mind wanders back to work, that phone call, that email, that meeting. You eat on the go and at times when you can. Your mind and body have been working hard but seem so out of sync. Things are constantly playing on your mind. It feels heavy. Every once in a while you think of that sound sleep, each meal being an occasion, leisurely walks, friends, time that you are in control of.But you\u2019re a go-getter and you keep at it. You continue to cope.You are probably one of the half million individuals suffering from work-related stress, depression or anxiety in the UK \u2014 at the cusp of \u2018burning out\u2019. It feels shit.At Soulscape we\u2019ve been devising ways to overcome burnout through creative and cultural journeys underpinned by lifting one\u2019s wellness in non-pretentious, transaction free, hassle-free travel experiences.Here are 7 steps to protect yourself from burning out:Our bodies are great at giving us indications that something in our system isn\u2019t right. Listen to it. Bad sleep, feeling anxious, not being able to switch off, losing appetite, irregular bodily functions\u2026 are all signs of that dreaded B word. One of the worst things you can do is to ignore the signs and keep pushing through. The fear of failure, your own ego for wanting to succeed and not wanting to let your team down are all familiar factors for wanting to ignore these signs \u2014 don\u2019t.The biggest mistake one can make is not share how they are feeling with another person you know cares. If you are wary of telling colleagues or friends then there are lots of organisations out there that you can reach out to. You won\u2019t be judged because burnout is a real thing that can drastically affect a person\u2019s mental and physical well being.This is something I am guilty of, always putting my work and my mission before by own wellbeing to a point where I have previously not only exhausted myself but the teams I am supposed to enable to do their best work too. It\u2019s taken a long time for me to even say this to myself \u2014 I am the priority. Several cultures around the globe promote having a strong work ethic but this is often accompanied by a real grounding in well being for example the work ethic of the Chinese is admired and talked about as \u2018super efficient\u2019, this is accompanied by the prevalence of meditation, Tai Chi, Qi Gong and healthy foods (not to exclude herbal teas).Just 20 mins. of physical activity each day can help bust stress. Your heart, mind and and body all work up a sweat and then relax. And there are so many great options too \u2014 from walking, running, cycling, badminton, hitting the gym, doing a class to having a go at ping pong, pilates, yoga\u2026 there are heaps of options. Break up your working day so that you definitely do something active in the morning, lunch time or in the evenings every day.I eat on the go \u2014 that\u2019s my thing, and have managed to eat well despite having to compromise on the time I spend consuming food. The trick is simple \u2014 opt for healthier food options like wholesome salads, freshly cooked soups, street markets have fresh food (way better than superstores) and try and regulate your meal times \u2014 breakfast, lunch and an early dinner. A friend who\u2019s a medic always keeps nuts and dry fruits in her pocket \u2014 great idea. I do this too now and am constantly nibbling in meetings. This will keep your metabolism going and will maintain good energy levels so much so that you won\u2019t need those multiple doses of coffee!One way of regaining your balance is by exposing yourself to new experiences. From music, theatre, water activities like kayaking or water paddling to drawing, languages etc. there\u2019s loads of stuff you can try. But the trick is to not judge till you\u2019ve had a go. I love urban music but surprised myself while accidentally walking into a classical music gig. Now I actively go and see various performers and concerts. Sometimes I have company, and sometimes I don\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s okay because I know there are a lot of people in the room just like myself.This can be a day off each week, a week off or a longer break. You can also plan nuggets of time-off in the working week for example, make your lunch an hour long activity that you do where you don\u2019t think about work, taking a walk, going for a run, people watching at a local cafe are all ways with which you can pause and rejuvenate.Remember that your wellbeing is of utmost importance and that each person\u2019s needs are different \u2014 what works for one may be different from what works for another. So, start with the mind and find out what works for your body.Originally published at tosoulscape.com on June 11, 2018.Written byWritten by","7373":"The short answer to why we need to motivate our children to workout: because it\u2019s healthy.It should generally go without saying that working out by engaging in physical activities such as sports or weightlifting produces a number of health benefits that protect the human body and keep it resistant against disease.However, being so quick to accept such a universal conclusion like \u201cexercise is good for your health\u201d might not be so wise despite how easy it is to make such a claim.This isn\u2019t to say that exercise doesn\u2019t result in good health, but that we should actually take a look into what types of exercises produce which health benefits as well as the extent of those health benefits afforded to us.Regular exercise possesses a powerful set of proven mental benefits, such as improving memory, sharpening your thinking skills, and preventing depression.Additionally, exercise is often cited as key in reducing the odds of a number of significant causes of death including obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and a host of mental illnesses like dementia.Studies have reported that hormones typically associated with physical activity, like adrenaline, have significant connotations towards preventing cancer.While exercise in general will have benefits across the demographic splits of any population, be it age, gender, socioeconomic status, or what have you, a crucial distinction we might make as part of these considerations should appear in the differences that regular, healthy exercise habits render for adolescents in comparison to adults.The developmental period of adolescence seems to be an especially important period for parents to get their teens involved in developing healthy exercise habits. Let\u2019s explore some of the reasons behind this.One frequent worry that many parents might have regarding their teenage children might involve the mental health of that child.While parents can do the utmost to care and ensure that their children grow up successfully, adolescence is often involves a disconnect between the emotions of the child and parent. This makes it tricky to really empathize deeply and understand what your children are going through.Adolescence has been determined as developmental period where children are especially vulnerable towards developing depressive symptoms.The similarity between depression and suicide indicates that there usually is some degree of comorbidity.A number of undesirable outcomes such as changes in sleeping and eating habits, not tolerating praise, violent actions, and drug and alcohol abuse are just some of the reasons to take the initiative against these mental illnesses.A study in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry notes that exercise produces a statistically significant antidepressant effect on adolescents aged 13 to 17 years old.Getting your teenager to participate in team-oriented physical activities such as sports or finding an individual exercise routine that fits them is a great way to prevent any chance developments of such problematic behaviors.In the same category, the use of antidepressants or anxiolytics to control unfavorable behaviors from developing in teens is concerning if those medications are to be taken in the long run.Among the classes of drugs, anxiolytic (anxiety-reducing) drugs belonging to the benzodiazepine class (think Xanax or Klonopin) are notorious for engendering dependence, losing their effectiveness over a few weeks or months, and making the symptoms they\u2019re supposed to be treated worse than before.The actual effectiveness of drugs such as Xanax in the long-term is the subject of a heated, ongoing controversy in the scientific community, and there is no defining consensus as of yet. At any rate, the deleterious effects of dependence associated with the use of these drugs is a major concern when it comes to the treatment of anxiety in teens.In these cases, exercise manifests as a greatly preferable option. In fact, exercise might be considered a blanket solution for mediating nonspecific therapeutic social and psychological treatments. Its applicability in the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects it naturally grants makes it incredibly accessible and helpful.Consistent and correctly performed exercise is not only comparable to an all-purpose tonic to prevent and work against a number of mental issues, it also produces measurable benefits to your physical and the overall health of your body\u2019s organ systems.Participating in moderate aerobic exercise such as walking has the potential to bring a host of minor benefits including weight loss, muscle strengthening and definition, stronger bones, lower heart rate, improved complexion, and so forth.Having these physical benefits adds up over time, and can be a major source of confidence for a teenager.Written byWritten by","7386":"Technology is connecting more people to yoga than ever before..here is whySantosha has developed an intimate online yoga teacher training course that lets students get all the practical learning while enabling a connection to the school and the virtual teachers.Santosha has been working with 1,000\u2019s of students over the years and has developed a state of the art teaching platform to provide the best possible online experience while infusing a taste of bali \u2014 as if you were there.\u201c I believe you need to start with passion and honesty to present the teachings in an accessible way to students.

I\u2019m not talking about the occasional sleepless night. I\u2019m talking multiple nights a week of little to no sleep. It was a hellish time in my life \u2014 I\u2019ve written about here.I\u2019m still not sure what triggered it. I simply had one bad night, and then another, and then it became a regular thing. At the time, I\u2019d recently received a promotion at work and I was in a new relationship. I\u2019m also just an anxious person in general. So it\u2019s possible all these things had something to do with it \u2014 but there\u2019s no specific event I can point to that caused it.The good news is \u2014 it\u2019s taken about 4 years, but I\u2019m finally sleeping a lot better. And I\u2019d like to tell you about some of the lesser known strategies that helped me get to this point.If you\u2019re an insomniac like I was, you know there are a lot of common tips out there for how to sleep better. Many of these repeat the same advice about sleep hygiene \u2014 things like: no screens an hour before bed, no caffeine after 2pm, exercise regularly, keep your room quiet and dark, etc.While some of these things helped me sleep better, there are also several tips that I often don\u2019t see that helped me fix my insomnia. This article is devoted to those.Before I get into them, a disclaimer: I\u2019m not a doctor. If you\u2019re having trouble sleeping, you should see one to rule out any underlying medical causes.That said, my insomnia was not caused by underlying medical issues. In my case, it was related to psychological and behavioral causes. So, much of the information here will address those, and the steps I took to get myself back on track. It\u2019s worth noting though, that even if you don\u2019t feel your insomnia is caused by psychological factors, I still think these tips could be worth employing.So, without further adieu, here are the counterintuitive things that helped me fix my insomnia:When I used to have a bad night of sleep, the following day I\u2019d always try to compensate for that bad night by going to bed earlier. If I hadn\u2019t fallen asleep until 3, I\u2019d thought, maybe I should try going to bed at 9 or 10, for example.Then, I started an online cognitive behavioral therapy program for insomnia (CBT-I) and it reframed the way I think about bed time. Before I get into why I now go to bed later than I used to, let me first explain a little bit about CBT-I.For those of you who don\u2019t know, CBT-I, like any other cognitive behavioral therapy program, includes a variety of psychological tactics and behavior modifications to improve your mental health (and in this case, your sleep, specifically). The main difference between CBT-I and conventional CBT is that CBT-I focuses on your sleep and the thought patterns that surround it. CBT-I programs also tend to include something called \u201csleep restriction.\u201d This is probably the most integral part of a CBT-I program.With sleep restriction, you limit the amount of time you spend in bed. The goal here is to increase your \u201csleep efficiency\u201d \u2014 aka the percentage of time you\u2019re actually sleeping while in your bed at night.The reasoning behind this strategy is that insomniacs tend to spend a lot of time physically in their beds \u2014 but much of this time is fitful and not spent actually sleeping. Over time, they condition themselves to have a negative association with sleep, their bed, and their bedroom. Sleep restriction helps reverse this conditioning.The way it works is the following:First, the insomniac determines how many hours per night she\u2019s sleeping on average (using a sleep diary for about two weeks). Once this is determined, she limits her time spent in bed every night to that amount of time exactly.For example, if your average nightly sleep is 6 hours \u2014 you must spend no more than that amount of time in bed each night. You choose what time you want to get up every morning (you must get up at the same time each day) and work backwards from there. If you want to get up at 6 am, you cannot go to bed any earlier than midnight.Each night, you record how many hours you\u2019ve slept and divide that by how many you were in bed. That ratio becomes your sleep efficiency. For example, if you slept 4 out of 6 hours, your sleep efficiency is 75%.After you\u2019ve achieved a week of >85% sleep efficiency on average, you can increase your time in bed by 15\u201330 minutes by either going to bed earlier or getting up later.I won\u2019t lie, this program is brutal at first. Limiting your time in bed winds up increasing your sleep drive. You\u2019re essentially depriving yourself of sleep to the point that you\u2019re so tired by the time bed time hits, you practically have no choice but to fall asleep.After awhile, your sleep becomes more restorative (even if it\u2019s not as long as you\u2019d like). This helps you build a better sleep-bed connection. You stop associating your bed with restlessness.But what it also taught me is that I shouldn\u2019t go to bed until I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m talking sleepy tired and not just tired. I\u2019m talking literally nodding off, cannot keep myself awake tired.Since the CBT program didn\u2019t allow me to go to bed until my sleep window arrived, I was usually dead tired by that time. While I don\u2019t restrict my sleep anymore, this gave me an idea of how tired I really need to be before even trying to go to bed.These days, I usually don\u2019t even set foot into my bedroom until I\u2019ve nodded off while watching tv.This is much more preferable to what I used to do, which was: try to sleep around 10:30 or 11, and toss and turn for a few hours until finally, maybe falling asleep. Usually, the fact that I wasn\u2019t falling asleep right away would worry me to the point where it became a self fulfilling prophecy and then I actually wouldn\u2019t fall asleep at all.Now, I don\u2019t even try to go to bed until I\u2019m basically passed out, which is typically a lot later (around 12\u201312:30) than I used to attempt going to bed. By that point, I\u2019ve typically built up enough sleep momentum that when I hit my bed I fall asleep within a few minutes.So, if you find that you tend to toss and turn in your bed for awhile before falling asleep \u2014 and you don\u2019t want to go as far as trying a sleep restriction program \u2014 try going to bed later to see if it helps. It kind of takes the pressure off of from thinking that you have to go to bed by a certain time.One caveat though: I still think you should maintain a relatively consistent schedule (particularly with your wake up time). In other words, if you\u2019re going to bed later, I\u2019m actually not suggesting you sleep in later. Doing so might screw up your circadian rhythm and will reduce your sleep drive for the following night. Keeping a relatively consistent schedule is one thing I think is non-negotiable if you want to sleep better.After all that, you might be thinking a 12\u201312:30 bed time seems too late, or you\u2019re worried that going to bed later means that you\u2019re not going to get enough hours of sleep. But, this leads me to the next paradigm shift that helped me cure my insomnia\u2026Like many insomniacs, I used to worry about the number of hours I\u2019d slept. I used to think of myself as someone who needed 9 or 10 hours a night to feel rested. If I wasn\u2019t on track to hit that amount, I\u2019d worry that I was never going to survive the next day on that little amount of sleep.After I started sleep restriction, though, I realized that my sleep quality is just as, if not more important, than quantity.When I would sleep during sleep restriction, I was maybe sleeping 6 or 7 hours a night. But because I was so tired by the time I hit my bed, this allowed me to sleep deeper than I\u2019d previously been sleeping. Whereas before I was giving myself 8 or 9 hours of opportunity to sleep, much of that sleep was not restful or restorative, when I was sleeping at all.I found that during sleep restriction, I actually felt ok on 7, or even 6, hours of sleep when the sleep felt solid and unbroken.Now, I know there\u2019s probably some expert out there thinking: most people need at least 8 hours of sleep and very few people can realistically survive on only 6 hours without suffering ill effects.And, that may be true. And maybe I was unknowingly slightly impaired after the nights when I only got that amount of sleep.But, I did feel ok on that little amount of sleep when it was high quality. And to an insomniac, that means the world. And I know lack of sleep can impair you \u2014 but you know what else can impair you? Stress. And if you feel stressed, especially if you\u2019re an insomniac and you\u2019re stressed about sleep, that\u2019s only going to make matters worse and add fuel to the vicious cycle of not being able to sleep because you\u2019re stressed about the fact that you haven\u2019t been able to sleep.So basically what I\u2019m trying to say is that anything you can do to circumvent the vicious cycle is helpful to an insomniac. And in this case, feeling ok and getting higher quality, albeit fewer hours, of sleep, starts to give you more confidence that you are even capable of sleeping like a normal human being. And that optimism, in turn, helps you build up to more hours of sleep.But even to this day, I sometimes wind up sleeping only 6 or 7 hours a night. And if it\u2019s high quality, and I feel ok, I don\u2019t worry about it or overthink it. That\u2019s a big key to eradicating your sleep troubles \u2014 finding ways to not sweat them so much.If you\u2019re an insomniac like I was, you\u2019re probably not going to want to hear this. It\u2019s a bit of tough love. And I\u2019m not trying to discount anything you\u2019re feeling, because I\u2019ve been there, but:You\u2019re probably sleeping better than you think you are. Or at least more than you think you are.It might be hard to believe, but chronic insomniacs routinely underestimate how much sleep they\u2019re getting per night. This phenomenon has been documented. When researchers compare polysomnographic recordings and how much subjects thought they slept versus how much they actually slept, insomniacs sometimes underestimate how much they\u2019ve slept by two hours or more.Now, this is not to say insomniacs are lying or that they don\u2019t actually feel like shit. And it\u2019s possible their sleep didn\u2019t feel very restorative. But the fact is is that insomniacs are often sleeping more than they think they are.Well, it\u2019s often due to a phenomenon called sleep state misperception. When you\u2019re in lighter stages of sleep, it can sometimes feel like you\u2019re still awake, because there\u2019s still thought activity occurring in the brain. Therefore, sometimes we feel like we\u2019ve been awake even though we\u2019ve actually been sleeping lightly.This used to happen to me a lot. I would go to bed at around 11:30 or so. A few hours would pass and I would suddenly be conscious of the fact that I was awake, but it didn\u2019t necessarily feel like I had just woken up from a deep sleep or anything \u2014 it felt like maybe I had been awake the whole time. It felt like I had been having thoughts, but I couldn\u2019t really tell you what those thoughts were.But I could tell time had passed by looking at the clock. It\u2019s a weird feeling \u2014 it kind of feels like you were just abducted by aliens and you\u2019d just sort of lost time because they erased your memory or something. I would lie there in bed wondering, was I just sleeping or have I been awake this whole time?Knowing what I know now, I\u2019m pretty sure I was asleep most of those times. It was just light sleep. And, when I experience that phenomenon now, I usually just tell myself I was, because believing you\u2019re sleeping better can actually lead to sleeping better. It\u2019s like a placebo effect, or a positive self fulfilling prophecy.So, what all this means is, if you\u2019re an insomniac, you should take heart. However poorly you think you\u2019re sleeping, you\u2019re probably doing better than you think. And, if you start actually believing that, it may, in turn, help you sleep even better.This is probably the most controversial of all the tips in this article \u2014 so I\u2019ll just come out and say it:I don\u2019t think sleeping pills are the devil (under the right circumstances).I\u2019ve been prescribed sleeping pills a few times. The first time I saw a doctor, he prescribed Trazodone (an anti-depressant). This really didn\u2019t do much for me. It made me feel a little calmer at night, but never pushed me over the edge into sleep. The second time I went to the doctor, he prescribed Restoril (a benzodiazepine, in the same class of drugs as Valium, Xanax, etc). This actually did help, and I usually limited my use to once or twice a week tops, or to when I knew I really needed to sleep the next day.The reason I don\u2019t like to demonize sleeping pills is because I think doing so can contribute to the worry and overthinking insomniacs are prone to. For example, when I started taking pills, I was scared. There are so many horror stories out there about people who developed a benzo addiction or did crazy things while they were on Ambien. So, naturally I felt like \u2014 oh my god, what if these pills ruin my life? I felt sort of guilty and stressed that I was taking them, and that sometimes affected my sleep, too.Fortunately, they didn\u2019t ruin my life, and I think all those crazy stories are more the exception than the rule. And once I realized they weren\u2019t going to ruin my life, I didn\u2019t feel that extra guilt and stress for taking them.My advice to anyone who wants to try a sleeping pill is to be mindful of your own body, your susceptibility to addiction, and the risks of the particular drug you\u2019re prescribed. Also, it may take a few different tries to find a drug that works for you with minimal side effects. So, be patient if the first drug doesn\u2019t work.All that said, I\u2019m not a doctor, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. And I think insomniacs should try other methods (sleep restriction, therapy, sleep hygiene etc) before resorting to pills. I also don\u2019t necessarily think people should be taking these pills every day or using them as a long term solution.However, I think medication can be ok as either a short term or occasional solution. And you don\u2019t need to feel bad for taking them.There are some sleep hygiene tactics that work for me and help me get to sleep. For example, I really do need a dark room. In fact, I\u2019m so sensitive to light that in the summer my circadian rhythm shifts and I start naturally waking up earlier just because I can see the light shining through my blinds at 7 am. I generally just don\u2019t sleep well if there\u2019s any light in the room.I also think keeping a consistent sleep schedule (within 30 minutes or so) is extremely important. This was a huge factor in regulating my sleep. And it makes sense. If you sleep in here and there, you\u2019re going to screw up your sleep drive. It\u2019s like trying to eat dinner soon after eating a large, late lunch. You\u2019re not going to be hungry \u2014 just as you won\u2019t be sleepy if you\u2019ve indulged on sleep the night before.I\u2019m also one of those people who needs a cool room to sleep. Every night, I set the thermostat to 66 or 67 degrees. If it\u2019s any warmer than that, I notice. Sixty-eight degrees or hotter feels like a sweltering summer night and I\u2019m tossing and turning until I lower it.Lastly, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m sensitive to caffeine. God forbid I have a coffee or Red Bull after lunch, I\u2019m screwed. I\u2019m up all night and it\u2019s obvious why. I also can\u2019t exercise too late, or that jacks me up as well.So, while those rules of sleep hygiene have helped me, I\u2019m not militant about every single rule. For example, some experts say you shouldn\u2019t watch t.v. before bed. But \u2014 I do this all the time. And it doesn\u2019t adversely affects my sleep. Almost every night, I fall asleep on the couch watching tv. It helps me relax. And once I\u2019ve fallen asleep on the couch, I just drag my already sleepy body upstairs to fall asleep on my bed.Basically, I feel like anything that helps you relax should be fair game.There have been times where I\u2019ve tried to follow every facet of sleep hygiene to the letter. But doing so is actually exhausting in and of itself.At one point, I was more or less treating myself like a science experiment. Getting up at the same time every day, using a daylight simulator early in the morning, making sure I got exercise every day, not allowing myself to watch tv at night, eliminating all caffeine, using blue light glasses while on my phone at night and\/or just avoiding blue light altogether. It was just silly. Following all these rules just became another source of stress, which, naturally, didn\u2019t help my sleep at all.The thing is, there was a point in time when I was able to sleep just fine, and I never even thought about it. I just needed to get back to the mindset I used to have. So trying to follow all these rules was just counterproductive. It may take some trial and error, but find the sleep hygiene rules work for you and don\u2019t worry about the others. Take what you like, and leave the rest.When my insomnia first started, I did so much Googling. Some of this resulted in good advice, but there was a lot of scary information out there too.There are a ton of articles out there about how detrimental sleep deprivation is.If you must Google, stick to Googling ways to help yourself and avoid articles that tell you how bad sleep deprivation is. You already know it\u2019s not great. There\u2019s no sense in reminding yourself of this fact. Doing so is only going to fuel the vicious cycle. The more you worry about your health and sleep, the more you\u2019re going to be up at night worrying about your health and sleep. It\u2019s just totally counterproductive.I still have bad nights from time to time.Sometimes, I know exactly why. I can pinpoint it to that afternoon caffeine or a really intense workout I did a little too late.But other times, I just don\u2019t sleep well, and the reason isn\u2019t obvious. I could have done everything right \u2014 early morning exercise, plenty of daylight, ate well, nothing anxiety inducing going on the next day \u2014 and for some reason I slept poorly.But the thing is, everyone on this earth has those nights. I used to have them before I was an insomniac, and I\u2019m sure I will continue to have them until the day I die.The difference is \u2014 normal people don\u2019t overthink these bad nights. They just move on, and sleep better the following night.So, if you have a bad night \u2014 just know it happens to everyone and it can be random. No need to delve too deeply trying to figure out exactly why it happened.About 10% of the general population suffers from chronic insomnia.About 30% of people suffer from acute insomnia at some point during their lives.That\u2019s actually a shitload of people.When I was in the throes of my worst insomnia, the thing that sucked the most was the intense loneliness I felt. I don\u2019t think normal sleepers truly understand this. It seems like everyone in the world is able to sleep except for you. It becomes easy to see how someone would take his or her own life. You start to feel broken, physically and psychologically.But, at any given moment, there are literally millions of other people going through the same thing.There are support groups out there, too. When I started my online sleep restriction program, it had a community full of supportive people who were just like me. There are also Facebook groups, Reddit communities, and other online forums as well.So, if you\u2019re ever feeling like you\u2019re the only one out there with this affliction, know there are actually lots of people in this moment experiencing the same exact thing. Just knowing this fact and reaching out to others who were going through the same thing often made me feel better.You may have noticed there\u2019s kind of a theme throughout each of these tips. And it\u2019s that a big part of ending insomnia is to not overthink it \u2014 to not fuel the cycle of not sleeping by worrying about sleep to the point where you don\u2019t sleep.If you\u2019re like me, there was a time when you slept normally. You can get back to that again. It\u2019s important to believe that. You\u2019re not irreparably broken. And you\u2019re not alone.Create a consistent sleep schedule (at least with your wake time) and don\u2019t sleep in. Let your circadian rhythm develop predictability. While I think some of the sleep hygiene stuff can be fudged \u2014 this is the one that can\u2019t be negotiated. If you try to fix your insomnia without doing this, it likely won\u2019t work. You need to allow yourself to build a routine \u2014 to get tired reliably at around the same time.And then don\u2019t overthink the other stuff. Focus on quality over quantity, don\u2019t binge on negative articles, allow yourself to discover what relaxes you. But be patient with yourself, too. Rebuilding your sleep can take time. For me, it took several months to work back to a normal schedule. But I did it, and I think you can too.If you\u2019re struggling with sleep, I\u2019d love to hear your story or any questions you have about my recovery.

And as I do, I witness countless yoga teachers, therapists, somatic therapists, massage therapists, and physical therapists telling the stressed out to take a nice deep breath to get grounded. To this I say: STOP! Please do not insist folks take a deep breath.On the surface, it makes a lot of sense to tell people to take a deep breath. We commonly think of deep breathing as a way to slow down time, our breath, and ultimately our autonomic nervous system. But guess what \u2014 lots of people with chronic stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, or complex post-traumatic stress disorder, will find this act at best, damn near impossible, and at worst, triggering.If you live with chronic stress or trauma, there is a good chance that you experience constriction in your primary breathing muscle \u2014 the diaphragm.The diaphragm is a muscle beneath your ribcage that contracts and flattens out to fill your lungs with air. As you exhale, it relaxes and expands upward. When we are breathing at rest in a parasympathetic state, it should handle most of the work.Working in conjunction with the diaphragm is a whole set of secondary breathing muscles \u2014 your intercostals, scalenes, sternocleidomastoids, pecs minor, and abs.These muscles are of your neck, chest, and belly. And theoretically when you are at rest, they are too. Even when you are working hard in a sympathetic state, they are only handling some of the load. That said, if you live with chronic stress or trauma these muscles are often overused, and your diaphragm does almost none of the work.Although I had experienced this in my own body, my teacher, Jane Clapp, was the first person I heard speak to this phenomenon. During her Movement for Trauma program, she spoke to the potentially triggering nature of working with the breath and the importance of breathing through the nose. This would go on to inform a lot of what I do with myself and others.Imagine you are hiking and you see a bear or some other predator you find threatening. Sense into your body. What does it feel like? What are your muscles doing? It is likely your whole trunk is constricted. This is a life-or-death situation, and your limbic system has taken the reins and is going to do its damnedest to save you with some defensive mobilization or immobilization.Now I am going to ask you to imagine that you are running late for a very important meeting, and you are stuck in traffic or on a stopped subway train without cell service. You are going to miss something very important and have no way to let the others know. Sense into your body. What is your breathing like, and where are you breathing from? Is any air making it into your belly? Probably not. Your whole trunk is constricted even though this is not a life-and-death situation \u2014 it is just very stressful.In both cases \u2014 actual life or death, and perceived to be life or death \u2014 you braced. And even when that bear runs off, and that train starts to move again, your diaphragm will probably still be constricted with the lingering stress. Many of us don\u2019t realize that we have not relaxed our diaphragms and that we are always bracing our primary breathing muscle to some extent.I work as a beginning strength coach with the general population in New York City, and I can tell you that for the most part, New Yorkers are a bunch of chest-breathers hustling and living in a very stimulating environment. It is common for people living with trauma, or simply with a lot of stress, to be stuck in a defensive state \u2014 fight or flight. Their trunks are always bracing just a little, and that diaphragm rarely gets the chance to move.What happens to muscles that have not been moved? That\u2019s right \u2014 they get stiff and eventually weak. It does not feel good when you become keenly aware that your muscles are stiff and weak. Telling a constricted person to take a deep breath invites them to realize just how tight everything is inside. For some people that may be okay, but for others \u2014 people like me \u2014 it can feel terrifying. It can feel claustrophobic, suffocating, and absolutely triggering. Deep breaths are a goal for folks like us \u2014 not the starting place.The good news is that there are countless alternatives to get grounded, present, and mindful of the body. The following are a few techniques you can use rather than going straight for the breath.Ask your client to tune into the body and find a place that feels neutral. Encourage the client to put the attention there. Neutrality is often found in places like the hands or the seat. People might feel funny that their butt feels good, but it often does. Let them get grounded by feeling into a part of their body that feels supported and easy, rather than going straight for the center.When I began to incorporate mindfulness meditation into my own treatment, I realized that the only place that felt safe to focus on was my hands. So that is where I started. Only after many months of daily sitting, as well as using other healing modalities, was I able to move to focusing on the breath.For some folks, turning inward at all is dysregulating. Suddenly becoming aware of your state can be quite jarring at times. For clients who cannot ground by looking for resources inward, I ask them to become situated and present by looking around and naming five blue things, five red things, and five yellow things. It gets people to closely look at their environment and keeps their prefrontal cortex turned on as opposed to triggering an emotionally reactive limbic response.If I am encouraging someone to turn inward I will ask the person to first listen for sounds far away \u2014 people talking outside, wind, cars \u2014 and then closer sounds like water running through the pipes or cooking sounds in the kitchen, and then even sounds from inside of that person\u2019s own body. If I am trying to bring someone\u2019s awareness back outside of the body, I encourage the same process but in reverse \u2014 starting nearby and opening up to sounds far away.And if breath is the main driver of your practice like in yoga or certain mindfulness meditation practices, you can suggest the client follow the breath without manipulation. By being behind the breath (following it), the constriction can feel less stifling than being on top of it (focusing on it). But please keep in mind that for some people, following or focusing on the breath is a goal, not a tool to be employed right in that moment.Lastly, if you work with the body you can help your client get the diaphragm moving again when they are ready. In strength sports we use a diaphragmatic breath and valsalva \u2014 a forced exhalation \u2014 to brace for each lift. Singers, musicians, dancers, and yogis all use the diaphragm extensively. My coach, Jesse Irizarry, taught me how to teach people to brace to lift. I couple his technique with a gentle inhale to be sure the diaphragm moves. This is how I instruct every person I work with to brace:Yes, now after years of diaphragmatic breathing, I can take a deep breath without panicking, simply because I can take a deep breath at all. But it took work. On behalf of the constricted breathers who panic when they notice their constriction, I am going to ask you to not start with the breath when working with trauma. Get creative or use the tools I listed above, but start somewhere safer, or possibly outside of the body completely.Written byWritten byAbout this Anthology","7591":"Generous spirits embody a generosity helping and allowing others to do what they desire in the pursuit of their dreams and goals, or sometimes just to help them survive with dignity. Gifts given with conditions attached are not generosity but levers of control by the giver to make them feel better about themselves and get others to do their bidding.What are generous spirits? People inhabited by generous spirits give to others mostly with no thought of personal benefit\u2026wanting to add value to other beings and the greater society.It is not only their actions but a state of being.Generous spirits manifest themselves in many different ways. Some by giving away large sums of money they are blessed to have. Others through random acts of kindness.A few by dedicating their lives in service to other beings and the broader society. These all are acts of generosity with intentions to serve the greater good.What motivates people to have these intentions? Why do they do it? These are questions often pondered by observers of these actions.Many are motivated by the desire to benefit others and make the world a better place. Often being grateful for their good fortune and desiring to share it with others.Some are motivated by their egos to get recognition and adulation from others. While their spirits may not be as generous they still benefit other beings through their gifts and contributions.Extending generosity to ourselves and others gladdens our heart, is a direct way of healing division, and brings joy.Christina Feldman, Heart of Wisdom, Mind of CalmGenerous spirits realize the importance of extending generosity to themselves as well as others.Taking care of their own needs and holding themselves in compassion and self-forgiveness when necessary.Generosity to one\u2019s self creates a foundation for extending generosity to other beings with loving-kindness and compassion.These actions convey a message as to what they value in their lives. It is a message to them as well as to the greater society.A way to touch the sacred humanity deep within themselves. It is a lesson to us all that we can embrace and appreciate, and perhaps emulate in our own ways.Let\u2019s look at the stories of some of those with generous spirits. Mostly seeking nothing in return other than the satisfaction of knowing they are helping and benefitting those who need help.We read about the Bill and Melinda Gates, the Warren Buffets, the George Soros types and other prominent people of great public wealth who establish foundations for the greater good.They give away substantial portions of their fortunes in the billions of dollars. They are obviously to be celebrated and commended for their generosity as they often are in the public media.But what about some of the lesser known individuals who are never in the news appearing in their lifetimes to have modest means. But making significant contributions often unrecognized and unheralded until their deaths.I am talking about people like Margaret Southern of Greenville, South Carolina. She taught special needs children and was a caregiver to her ailing brother. At her death she left $8.4 million to the Community Foundation of Greenville.In addition there were hundreds of thousands of dollars gifted to other charities and her relatives. Friends in the community and family members were shocked when she died in 2012 and the gifts became known.Then there was Ronald Read of Brattleboro, Vermont. He left $4.8 million to the Brattleboro Memorial Hospital and $1.2 million to the town\u2019s Brooks Memorial Library. His only known jobs were 25 years at a gas station and then 14 years as a janitor for J.C. Penny.Eugenia Dodson of Coral Gables, Florida was another unknown spirit of generosity. She gifted $35.6 million upon her death at 100 years of age.It went jointly to the Diabetes Research Institute and University of Miami Comprehensive Cancer Center. Her two brothers died from diabetes and she had been treated for cancer.Eugenia grew up in rural Silver Creek, Minnesota. She came to Miami when she was 20 and worked in a beauty shop. She lived a very frugal life and invested wisely.What all of these generous spirits had in common has been an intention to contribute to their communities without any desire for recognition\u2026truly selfless motivations.Another type of generous spirit is a being with their life devoted to relieving the suffering of other beings.This includes people such as Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Mahatma Gandhi of India, Malala Yousafzai of Afghanistan, Albert Schweitzer, a French-German humanitarian and physician and Martin Luther King, Jr. in the United States. People who constantly put themselves at risk for the benefit of all beings.Gandhi died at the hands of an assassin. He had become the soul of the movement for Indian independence after initially leading a movement for civil rights in South Africa.He was nominated but never won the Nobel Peace Prize but now has the International Gandhi Peace Prize named after him.Malala was nearly killed because she and other girls just wanted an education. Now Malia has become the global spokesperson on behalf of girls\u2019 education having won the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize.Mother Teresa and Albert Schweitzer constantly comforted and tended people with deadly diseases that others would not come near. Schweitzer received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952 and Mother Teresa in 1979.Marin Luther King, Jr. led the Civil Rights Movement in the United States until his assassination in 1968 being arrested and jailed several times. He was the 1964 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.Also organizations such as Doctors Without Borders and Human Rights Watch with people putting themselves in danger every day to help other beings often just trying to survive. They are comprised of many doctors, lawyers and others volunteering in dangerous places to make a difference in our world.The people described above are all generous spirits seeking to serve others in their own ways. Of course there are many others in our society and around the world expressing generosity in their lives every day.Some by giving to their churches, to organizations and foundations with a mission for serving the well-being of people and societies. Others with random acts of generosity like giving the homeless woman or man on the street food or money to help with their survival. Still others are contributing money to various causes for the good.We all have the innate goodness within ourselves to be generous spirits in our own ways. Why do some of us choose generosity while many do not? It is a question each of us must answer for ourselves.It is a question of our deepest values and how we manifest those values to the world and other beings. It comes down to the age old question, \u201cWho am I\u201d?Who are we and what is our message to the world? Only each one of us can truly know the answer for ourselves.It a critical component of our self-identity and how we regard ourselves.If we extend generosity to ourselves we will likely extend it to others as well. Our happiness and well-being are largely the result of how we regard ourselves. Whether our spirit is generous or stingy has a strong influence on that feeling.Written byWritten by","7603":"Most of us have been there: Drawn curtains darkening the bedroom, pulsing headache, and an empty promise to ourselves that \u201clast night was the last time I\u2019ll ever drink.\u201d But let\u2019s be real \u2014 it\u2019s far more the social norm to drink than to abstain, and many of us may often find ourselves playing this scenario on repeat.Don\u2019t get me wrong. After a killer day out with friends, I\u2019m certainly not ANTI savoring a craft beer while watching the sunset. But the glass is tipping (pun intended): Sobriety is starting to gain in momentum, particularly in the wellness community. This is certainly true for yoga teacher, Mary Beth LaRue, who found herself thriving both on and off the mat after embracing an alcohol-free lifestyle.As for many of us, alcohol was always present in Mary Beth\u2019s life. From a couple of glasses of wine in the bathtub disguised as \u201cself-care\u201d to a night out dancing, booze presented itself as a non-negotiable frenemy that always paired well with hangovers, a lack of awareness, and a less-than-present state than Mary Beth wanted for herself. Alcohol, she says, kept her small. Its nasty side effects didn\u2019t align with who she wanted to be in the world.While an increasing number of individuals are stepping away from alcohol and finding alternative routes to forge connections with others, it can be challenging to cut the initial ties to substances. Each road to sobriety is unique. Whether it is through movement and breath \u2014 or finding mindful events and communities that encourage intentional lifestyle choices \u2014 it may not be easy. An important step on the journey is to honor yourself for choosing to dive deeper. And then work to enjoy the space of presence and awareness that going clear provides.Maybe you chose to start the month going \u201cdry\u201d, or you\u2019ve decided to completely cut booze from the picture for good. Regardless of where you are at, the space and opportunities that come from going clear can majorly shift your perspective of self and your surroundings.Sobriety, Mary Beth says, allowed her to step into a place of creation rather than reaction. From being featured on the cover of Yoga Journal to fostering a beautiful baby boy with her husband, Mary Beth\u2019s life went from black and white to technicolor when she made the empowering personal decision to cut out alcohol. As Mary Beth found, ridding the mind and body of alcohol expands your time in so many ways. With sobriety, you are the master of your days and can sculpt them without the dark cloud of a hangover \u2014 or even a slight mental fuzz \u2014 holding you back. That morning yoga class you always miss? Not today! That deep conversation you had with your partner last night? Remembered and stored in the memory vault.But OK. Let\u2019s be real. It\u2019s not easy to have a night out without drinking. So just what does sobriety mean for your social life? Here\u2019s the thing: While sipping a cocktail on the dance floor may seem necessary to get your groove on, alcohol can actually separate us from our true nature and hold us back from stepping into our full presence and power.Here are some ideas to make a booze-free night a bit easier:It isn\u2019t always easy to face problems or emotions head on, but by creating space and allowing ourselves to sit with emotions and thoughts, we are given the opportunity to build mental \u2014 and emotional \u2014 strength and awareness. With sobriety comes clarity, and often in that clear state of mind, we are able to shed excess baggage that does not push us closer towards our true north. We can pursue those meaningful relationships and live with intention, passion, and vigor each and every day.Similar to the lessons we learn on the mat, going clear provides us with the extraordinary perspective of the perfectly imperfect power of the present moment. Breathing through the burn of holding a posture for a long period of time teaches us contentment and awareness. While sober, we call on that same yogic philosophy by being able to stay present with the emotions and feelings that arise rather than escaping through the numbness of alcohol.Mary Beth found that channeling her energy and emotions through reading, writing, meditation, and yoga proved to be a supportive path on her journey to sobriety. As Benjamin S\u00e1enz says, \u201cIf you can quit for a day, you can quit for a lifetime.\u201d You don\u2019t need to have a bad relationship with alcohol to give sobriety a shot. The next time you feel like drinking, ask yourself, \u201cIs there something else I\u2019m craving?\u201d Often times, becoming aware of our impulses provides an opportunity to redirect our focus and energy in a more productive and healthy way so we can truly thrive as humans \u2014 on and off the mat.Written byWritten by","7618":"\u201cThere\u2019s so much complaining about bullying these days. Kids just need to toughen up.\u201dI\u2019ve heard that numerous times. It\u2019s not easy, though. Being the target of relentless bullying wears you down. Yes, as a child, I was bullied.Name-calling, mocking, jeering, laughing at my expense, and isolation. I dreaded going to school, and once I returned home I\u2019d release my tears. Day in, day out. The worst of the worst was Dawn. She excelled in her hobby of treating others like dirt. She had the power to make any of us feel insignificant. My mother once told me that I just needed to grab her by the hair and drag her to the office the next time she tried something. All I could envision was being pummeled into the asphalt, so I took the hate she spewed and attempted invisibility. After a year or two, it tapered off. Whether or not it would have stopped overall, I don\u2019t know. My family relocated to Texas. Initially, I might have been the only one in my family truly excited about the change. Looking forward to a fresh start, I was overjoyed when classmates spoke kindly to me and included me. I felt relief.Headlines of bullying are recurrent. Many victims of bullying taking their lives via suicide, some of whom include 8-year-old Gabriel Taye, 12-year-old Mallory Grossman, 14-year-old Luken Boyle, 13-year-old Arin Lyth, 13-year-old Hailee Lamberth, 13-year-old China Howard, and on and on and on.13-year-old Peyton James took his own life, as well. Peyton is the son of my friend and former colleague, David. Peyton\u2019s death hit me hard, as he was only a year older than my son. I had always been concerned my son would be bullied due to his smaller stature and sensitive nature, and he has been.Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among people aged 10\u201324.As a teacher, I witness it every year\u2026students being hateful to one another. They make jabs, name call, use sarcasm to belittle, purposely \u201cbump into\u201d someone they don\u2019t like so they can go off on them. This all transpires before me. Next, they wield the world of social media as a weapon. Hiding behind a username, the bullying turns vicious. I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019d be alive today if my bullying took to the path of social media. David has written a bit about this, as well. One article includes an arrest of a student from where we taught together. A teenage girl was arrested for possessing and texting a nude photo of another girl to two male students. This is an example of cyberbullying and sexting uniting to make some situations move from atrocious to criminal.I\u2019ve seen my students struggle with victimization, depression, cutting, admittance to psychiatric hospitals, shutting down emotionally, and struggling with suicidal thoughts.At a school in which I taught, we often discussed how words can affect others, how we don\u2019t always see the wound they leave within someone\u2019s heart. During these lessons, students seem to understand the concept. Yet, it\u2019s only theoretical. When they move to their next class, many of the students don\u2019t think before they speak and act. They immediately revert to their own habits of how they treat one another.Teaching students the importance of kindness, tolerance, and acceptance continually becomes more and more arduous. Our children are bombarded with examples of the opposite\u2026from politicians to celebrities to YouTube stars to their parents.Yes, their parents and other adults they encounter during their lives. They observe how we handle conflict, how we talk about others, how we behave. They learn by example. Changing the behavior of our youth will be a slow process, yet one that is feasible.Begin with yourself. Don\u2019t rationalize bad behavior. There is always a more apt way to respond. Yes, we may slip up; no one\u2019s perfect. However, we can still model how to remedy the situation instead of letting it remain as is.

K has the solution to every conceivable human problem, explicit and implicit, and even the solutions for infinite unknown problems. However, K\u2019s outputs are incomprehensible to even the most expert among the experts. U has the meaning of every symbol, an interpretation for every representation, and mastery over all languages \u2014 including K\u2019s.At the inauguration of the twin system, politicians, investors, and researchers debate what question should be asked first. Some questions consider God, some happiness, others peace. Every delegation has a preference for a variation of the fundamental problem, though a few believe themselves to have a radically different question. The assembly finally settles on a version that, in English, can be understood as: \u201cHow should one live?\u201dThe operators, all protocols observed, submit the problem to K, which computes quietly for 80 days before printing a single number: \u201c42.\u201dThe operators are confused, some are enraged, most are terrified at the prospect of explaining the answer to the stakeholders. Nevertheless, they submit the number to U for interpretation. U, after a few minutes, prints: \u201cK is kidding.\u201dIn order for the world to stop resisting our consciousness, our consciousness needs to stop resisting the world.Just then, K\u2019s circuits start buzzing again and four diagrams are printed. This time, it takes U a day to translate each message.What follows are memos published by the Organization for the Fulfillment of Humankind, with recommendations based on K\u2019s diagrams and U\u2019s interpretations.Without freedom, there are no ethics. The problem of freedom (that is, the problem of ethics) has a natural first response. We are usually happier when we have choices than we are without, and we suffer from a lack of choice even before the adverse effects of that absence reach us, if it does at all. That is because we value freedom for the wealth of future possibilities it provides us, not so much for the present ones. The only moment we are not happy with an abundance of choice is when we are missing a guiding principle to navigate it. Hence the diagram from U:The first principle is freedom: to be free is to be rich in future, therefore we ought to make choices that increase our freedom.The hermit who, at each instant, reaffirms his choice to sit still in contemplation and gratitude is happier than the kid who is forced to sit for a moment, wishing to do anything else. Yet even the hermit needs a little space to breathe and a little time to express gratitude. The future is the space in which our selfhoods vibrate; the less constraints there are on that space, the softer, brighter, and healthier the vibration.However, there are external conditions that can suddenly limit our freedom in ways for which this principle does not prepare. We now know that we ought to steer our futures away from narrow paths, but there is no obvious way to make choices that will lead us toward wider ones.At a certain point in their evolution, humans noticed \u2014 with a mixture of thrill and shock \u2014 that their lives were happening in parallel, in two separate domains: the inside (consciousness) and the outside (world). They realised that everything they could see and touch \u2014 including their own bodies \u2014 was part of the outside, while everything that seemed to matter more was part of the inside.The fundamental problem of life is made complicated by the fact that there is a natural transfer from the outside to the inside, what is felt upon a body is processed within oneself. Whereas the inverse requires, arguably impossible, effort: how to express what is felt upon what can be felt. This is where strength is needed. If freedom is inside us, strength is required for its implementation. If freedom is the sea we want to sail, then strength is the boat to carry us; the boat is the difference between sailing happily upon the water and being drowned at the mercy of the waves. In the words of U:The second principle is strength: Freedom is unattainable without strength, therefore we ought to make choices that put us in a position of power over our future.The inside of a dull (or weak) person will, over the course of his or her life, be invaded by the outside, until he or she is comprised only of outside concerns. The wise (or strong) person, on the other hand, will expand the boundaries of his or her inside, until all is consumed by what is inside.The former person exists in a state absent of freedom while the latter in a state of abundant freedom. If we agree that the pursuit of freedom is worthy, then we have to build strength\u2014but what is the best way to use it?Newton\u2019s third law of motion asserts that a single isolated force doesn\u2019t exist. When one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first body.With strength, we have introduced a certain quantity of motion into the field of play. Lightness is a mode of deploying strength that maximizes motion and minimizes opposing weight.Reasoning by analogy, we understand that we cannot with our strength alone force our choices unto the world because heavy actions are met with heavy reactions, up to the point where the attrition is so painful that no motion is possible. Thus, U offers an interpretation of the third diagram:The third principle is lightness: Strength is impractical without lightness. Strength is not only within us; harvesting that which is around us allows us to deploy strength without building weight.In order for the world to stop resisting our consciousness, our consciousness needs to stop resisting the world. The next and last principle identifies an optimal middle point at which this compromise may occur.If lightness recommends a pattern of motion, then balance is a way to arrange those motions (and the exchanges they involve). With balance comes reduced tension at the interface of the consciousness (the inside) and the world (the outside). An inherently dynamic equilibrium, it needs to adapt as its environment alters. Changes in the environment are cyclical; after all, life is a composition of rhythms. Reaching a state of least resistance at the interface therefore requires listening to the soft but distinctive beat of the environment and resonating with it. As U suggests:The fourth principle is balance: Lightness is lost without balance. When consciousness beats with the same rhythm as the world, there is no tension between what is and what ought to be.When anxious people look at a river, they either seek its source \u2014 which they might call origin or meaning \u2014 or its mouth \u2014 which they might call destination or purpose. But the river prefers neither the source nor the mouth, and it is not conscious of running away from the mountains or toward the sea. The river is, at every moment in time, the source, the mouth, and each point in between.We need not be like the anxious people, who dissect the world into pieces; it is better to see the world as complete, in its entirety.We have to be like the tree, whose apparent stillness does not indicate a lack of life, but rather a continuous sequence of small adjustments to the air, sun, water, and ground. The tree that is free to be still, strong from the inside out, light in its force upon the world, and balanced as it subtly adapts to the rhythm of life. These adjustments are not made in an effort to get anywhere; they are made to just be, to fully be.Thus, K\u2019s diagrams and U\u2019s interpretations were made clear and the meaning of life discerned. The answer to the question, \u201cHow should one live?\u201d is: When we have a quiet but enthusiastic acceptance of life and everything there is, then, and only then, will we be alright.Written byWritten by","7660":"Dr. Jason Fung: I was having a discussion with Megan Ramos the other day in clinic, and she mentioned that yet another patient had gotten pregnant following the IDM dietary program. This was something like the 20th case we\u2019ve had. This particular person, being a bit older had never thought she would have her own baby, so getting pregnant was simply the greatest gift.With that in mind, I wanted to tackle the topic of infertility and PCOS and I wanted to introduce an important member of the Intensive Dietary Management (IDM) team \u2014 Dr. Nadia. She is our resident Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) expert and has a passion for the dietary treatment of PCOS and fertility. Dr. Nadia is one of our counselors, and contributes to our membership community answering questions and providing support.Dr. Nadia: I have a strange reputation for getting people pregnant. People often seek me out after hearing \u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t go to that doctor unless you want to get pregnant.\u201d My name is Dr. Nadia Pateguana and I\u2019ve been a Naturopathic Doctor in clinical practice for over 15 years. For couples living with fertility trouble, it\u2019s a welcomed miracle! Early in my career, I lived in a fairly small and tightknit community in Mozambique. I treated a South African woman, Charise for weight loss. She wanted to \u201cdetox\u201d, so I counselled her on my diet. Several months later, Charise booked an appointment, along with her husband, Johan. \u2018Strange\u2019, I thought, as I had I had met him only once in the initial visit.When they arrived, Johan was the one who first spoke. With a lot of emotion, he announced that they were now expecting a new baby! For the first 6 years of their marriage, they were unable to conceive. I don\u2019t quite remember how many rounds of IVF they had, but they underwent a gruesome and devastating fertility journey. Finally accepting the fact that that would never welcome a child of their own body into the world, they joyfully adopted their first child, now aged 7. But, in this unexpected twist of fate, they were now expecting their first biological child.Johan was confident that this \u201cdetox diet\u201d I prescribed for his wife was the reason for their sudden deliverance. Over the previous 3 months, Charise had successfully changed her eating habits and also kicked a long-standing, severe soda addiction. She adopted a Low-carb diet, a strict Low-Carb Diet, based on my \u201cBase Diet\u201d and \u201cDetoxes\u201d I went over with her. This diet warned against sugars, even the \u201chealthy\u201d sources of carbs like fruit and juices. It encouraged a moderate amount of protein and healthy fats: coconut oil, avocados, eggs, butter, olive oil, etc. Overcome with joy, they had come to thank me. I later learned that Charise had suffered a miscarriage and lost that child. But then, another \u201cmiracle\u201d happened. She conceived for a second time, and gave birth to a healthy baby boy.Johan wanted to understand this unexpected connection between this innovative diet and their new-found fertility, but I didn\u2019t have one to give him. I did not know myself how she suddenly got pregnant. There was obviously a relationship, but at that time, so early in my career, I just did not understand the profound link. From a practical perspective, it didn\u2019t really matter. I was proud of my many success stories, and would often explain to other patients that sometimes a little weight loss, and a \u201cdetox\u201d might help them bring home a \u201clittle bundle of joy\u201d.Although we did not make a formal diagnosis, Charise very likely suffered from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). We will discuss the specific diagnostic criteria in Chapter 2, but perhaps the most heart-wrenching sequela of this disease is infertility. Having a family is perhaps the most basic of human needs, and the inability to bear your own children obviously impacts that essential human dream.PCOS is the most common reproductive disorder in the world. It affects an estimated 8\u201320% of woman of reproductive age depending upon the specific diagnostic criteria used1 (Epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of polycystic ovary syndrome, Clinical Epidemiology 2014:6; 1\u201313 Sirmans, SM and Pate KA). Forty percent of patients diagnosed with PCOS suffer from infertility. 90\u201395% of women in infertility clinics who cannot conceive due to lack of ovulation suffer from PCOS.But my near-obsession with PCOS, fertility and diet is not merely professional, it\u2019s also deeply personal. I became a naturopathic doctor after developing irritable bowel syndrome as a young adult. Conventional medicine did not help, but I found some reprieve with naturopathic medicine. I graduated from the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in 2004, and moved back to my home country of Mozambique, planning to work with the Ministry of Health in impoverished communities. I hoped to learn local traditional medicine to complement my naturopathic training, which included some nutritional training.However, Mozambique politics were complicated and getting a job at the Ministry was not simple. I knocked on many doors, but they were (sometimes not so politely) slammed in my face. Eventually, I requested a meeting with the Minister of Health himself. After looking at my CV and listening to my story, he awarded me a license to practice private naturopathic medicine. He further advised me that I would likely do well in Maputo, the capital of Mozambique and the city where I was born. I felt defeated, because this was not the reason I had returned to my native country. But, with little other alternative, and unwilling to turn my back on Mozambique, I did just as he suggested.To my surprise, my practice was completely full within 6 months. Instead of helping the poor and malnourished, my clients were affluent, overweight suffering many of the same diseases of those in the Western hemisphere \u2014 the so-called \u2018Diseases of Civilization\u2019. Their overriding concern was weight loss, which would improve their type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular Disease, cancer and metabolic syndrome. They were suffering \u2018Western\u2019 diseases, because their diet had been modeled on the standard American diet (SAD).Mozambique, at the time considered the poorest country in the world, ached with one of the highest rates of malnutrition. But this masked a two-fold situation. At the same time that people in rural areas were starving, urban dwellers were overfed. The Western culture had invaded Mozambique. KFC, pizza joints, and Coca-Cola everywhere! Thus, my medical practice focused almost exclusively on nutrition, diet and weight loss from its very origins.Age 28. Thin, but not healthyMy training had not truly prepared me for this, but as the only naturopath in Maputo, I needed to become a nutritionist in order to help these people. Without formal training as a dietitian, I made my own diet plans, based on what made sense to me. Food was my medicine. Mozambicans are a wonderful and forgiving people willing to try anything I suggested.I was a very thin child and grew up into a very thin adult. Seeing this, my patients believed \u201cmy diet\u201d must work but this couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth. My diet was not particularly healthy, I now realize, and my thinness might have been genetics, combined with the fact that I was a very picky and poor eater. I never had a proper, full meal until well into my thirties.As a child and young adult, I disliked meat and vegetables immensely, so I snacked all day long. I lived off of candy, fruit, bread, lattes loaded with sugar and Coca-Cola! If I sat down for a meal with my family, I would eat refined grains with a bit of the sauce, wash it down with a Coke followed by some fruit. At night, I would go to bed with my bag of candies, and in the morning, I would start with a latte and toast. Only a couple of hours afterwards, I would feel shaky so I ate fruit or some more candy. I always believed that I suffered from hypoglycemia so eating sugar every few hours seemed to make sense. Little did I know that fast-forward 30 years I would develop metabolic syndrome.By age 30, I was a successful nutritionist in Mozambique. Everyone knew Dr. Nadia. I helped many people lose weight and control their diabetes with my prescribed \u201cBase Diet\u201d and an occasional \u201cdetox\u201d. But I followed none of these diets myself. I kept on eating my candies and drinking my Coke.In late 2008, my husband and I started trying to conceive, but my diet was catching up with me. I started gaining weight. My acne (which I had always had) got a bit worse. My doctor told me I was thin and healthy. Every single month I waited for my period not to come, but it always did, followed by days of crying and feeling miserable. Something was wrong. By the end of the year, I realized I must be infertile. I was devastated.By early 2010, I had gained close to 30 lbs although my Body Mass Index was still within the normal range. My acne was terrible and now my hair was falling out. Blood tests showed that my androgen (male hormones) levels were high, and an ultrasound revealed numerous cysts in my ovaries. I had stopped ovulating and could not therefore get pregnant. My suspicions were correct, and I was diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome).Because I was thin, my doctor overlooked everything else and simply prescribed Clomid, a type of fertility drug. I went home and simply cried. And cried. Only my husband\u2019s positive attitude got me through this dark cloud of guilt and self-pity. He assured me we would get through this and his confidence gave me the strength to take matters into my own hands.From my professional experience, I knew fertility improved when women under my care lost weight, as many became pregnant. My own weight wasn\u2019t an issue (I thought) but I started the strictest of my own diets. If that\u2019s what I had to do to get pregnant, I would do it. This extremely low carbohydrate diet is called a ketogenic diet. No more candies, no more Coke, no more bread.In the first month, I lost 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs), my acne cleared up, and my cycles normalized as I began to ovulate. The night before I took my first positive pregnancy test, I lit a candle. I was calm, and positive. I asked for nothing, but I wanted a baby. The next morning, I took the test. Those next 30 seconds I suffered the indescribably lonely agony of not knowing.2010The test was positive.I had just been granted the greatest gift. This was the day I had waited for an eternity. There was a light at the end of the tunnel. I called my unwavering husband at work. Deep inside, never showing it, he had been very concerned about my physical and emotional wellbeing. Infertility is an all-encompassing psychic struggle. It takes a toll on people\u2019s work, family and social life. In vitro fertilization (IVF), which I considered but refused, would have affected our finances too.After I got pregnant, because I didn\u2019t understand the key role of nutrition, I threw that diet right out the window! I didn\u2019t think I needed it. I returned to eating my candies and my usual higher carb, smaller snacks, many times a day. I developed serious complications during the pregnancy, including high blood pressure and liver damage which eventually required a C-section at 38 weeks.Beautiful Zinzi came into our lives. Unfortunately, my health was not great as I continued to suffer with high blood pressure and post-partum depression. One of the medications, amitriptyline made me gain 20 lbs.on top of the baby weight I was still carrying around.Two years later, a large ovarian cyst ruptured requiring urgent surgical removal. I was on high blood pressure medication still and my sleep never recovered.With baby #2, the tortuous journey began all over again. My doctor again prescribed clomid. This time, I was fatter, with a BMI in the overweight range and in much worse shape health wise. My biggest mistake was that I did not follow my own diet, but instead just took the medication. If they helped the first time, they certainly did not help this time around. Six grueling, agonizing months later, I still was not pregnant and crying constantly. It felt much more difficult even than the first time. Doom. All I remember is the overwhelming sense of doom.I stopped the fertility drugs, and visited my friend Dr. Carolina, a Mozambican gynecologist. She, flatly told me, \u201cOf course you won\u2019t get pregnant, not even on clomid, you are insulin resistant!\u201d Until that very moment insulin resistance related to PCOS never crossed my mind. She was right. Up until then, I had no hope, and no diet. She changed that, and wouldn\u2019t you know it, I got pregnant the very next month. Only much later did I realize that this low carbohydrate diet reduces insulin thereby improving insulin sensitivity and treating the source of my problems.Not all PCOS women are overweight, and not all overweight women have PCOS. After much deliberation, I decided to eat a low carbohydrate diet full time. A couple of months after Zuri was born, I lost all the weight, got off all medication, my skin cleared up, and all the other PCOS symptoms were gone (as well as my older symptoms like IBS, cravings, mood swings, etc). Adopting a strict low carbohydrate diet along with intermittent fasting was the way to go, for me.I learned many things along the way, mostly the hard way. I might not know everything, but I would like to share what I have learned, so that you do not go through the agony and the heartbreak of infertility. The most important lesson here is that in PCOS, and most metabolic diseases, the treatment is not drugs and surgery. You must change your diet. My passion in life is not only helping women get pregnant, but also help them lose weight and take control of their health through natural dietary measures.Written byWritten by","7726":"My face, calm and expressionless.My eyes, focused sternly on nothing.Thoughts running rampant\u2026so rapid I cannot make sense of them all.Feeling everything, yet stuck.Holding in my outrage.and my grief.Holding onto hope, yet it feels elusive.Making rash decisions, believing I can take on the world\u2026later realizing I\u2019m in over my head.I want to hide.to flee.I smile instead.Hiding emotions boiling up within me,My screams are silently supressed.I\u2019m fine.Copyright \u00a9 2018 Alicia T-Rust.

The whole thing was quite exciting for us. But when you are young, you often neglect your health to seek thrill. Doing Hackathons was a hell of a thrill for sure, but we forget one thing: that working long hours staring at a display can harm our eyes, and it did. Two of us got prescription glasses within weeks. \ud83e\udd13It was a lesson learned the hard way.When I first found out about my deteriorating eyesight, I started to freak out big time. I immediately started looking for information that would help me keep my eyes healthy. I made a few changes to my life and voila! My eyesight actually improved, and now I don\u2019t even need to wear the glasses that often.That was quite an eye-opening experience for me, pun slightly intended. So let me share with you what I learned. \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0fThis is generally the most overlooked factor, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m discussing this first. We all know how to adjust our screens according to our eyes so I\u2019m gonna skip that, but if you still wanna know more about it, read here. Second and most important thing is the lighting. Try to position your screen in a manner that a window is either on your right or left to avoid that glare you get on screen. If you are using an artificial light source in your workspace, prefer over-head lighting. Don\u2019t use extra bright lights that can put stress on your eyes. I personally prefer warm lights over white lights.You might have heard of the golden 20\u201320\u201320 rule. It goes something like this.\u201cEvery 20 minutes, look at something at least 20 feet away, for at least 20 seconds.\u201dIt\u2019s what your doctor might tell you to do. And yeah, it works\u2026 sorta. If you know how far 20 feet actually is, and you don\u2019t find it too boring. But honestly, it doesn\u2019t work for me and a lot of other people, I\u2019m sure. I tried it and failed miserably. So here are some easy and fun exercises I personally follow and recommend that can be equally helpful.Bounce the ball on the wall \ud83c\udfbeAs simple as it sounds. Just take a sponge ball (so that you don\u2019t destroy your surrounding) and hit the wall. Try to focus on the ball while doing it. This will help your eyes move around and focus on different distances as the ball travels. It\u2019s also very relaxing, almost meditative. You can also play darts \ud83c\udfaf if you\u2019d like. That helps too.The water massage \ud83d\udca6Whenever you go to the loo, just try and clean your eyes with cold water by splashing some on your face, and give your eyes a little massage. This will relax your eyes and remove any dryness that might have set in. Don\u2019t try to massage your eyes without washing them with water first, as that can damage eyes. Give it a try and you will thank me.\ud83d\ude43I\u2019m a techie! Can\u2019t help talking about some apps. These apps will help you directly or indirectly to save your eyes.Aware\/Awareness \u23f1Aware is small menubar widget for mac that will show you how much time you\u2019ve spent on your laptop without a break. So that you can be Aware, as the name suggests, and give your eyes (and your body!) a break every once in a while.Awareness does more or less the same thing but it\u2019s also available for Windows.f.lux \ud83c\udf05f.lux is a very popular software that reduces the blue light rays coming from your screen. It automatically adjust the colors of your screen according to the time of the day. Too much blue light after sunset can alter your sleep cycle (by tricking your brain into thinking it\u2019s still daytime) and increase eye problems too. flux fixes that for you. If you\u2019re a designer who wants accurate color reproduction at all times, this might be a bit of a problem for you \ud83d\ude00 (Oi, you shouldn\u2019t be working on your computers late at night anyway but I\u2019m not your mom so whatever!) but otherwise it\u2019s great tool.And this is a great time to shout out to fellow developers. If you guys have any ideas of an app to help eyes, I\u2019m up for collaboration. DM me @twitterMy mother says what you eat is what you become. Well, that\u2019s true in this case as well. There are some dietary changes you\u2019ll need to make as well.The most important thing is water. If you stay dehydrated for long, that can lead to eye dryness and that further leads to eye strain. Drink at least 2\u20133 liters of water every day and that will not only help your eyes but your whole body.Including these following foods in your diet can also improve your eyesight, and you may also get rid of those spectacles like I did.Other than this, try to include lots of green veggies and protein-rich food in your diet. This is tried and tested advice, and also worked really well for me.Work is important, I get that. But smartphones are ruining our eyes, much more than computer screens in most cases. Staying in bed for hours staring at those tiny screens, it\u2019s gotta stop. Like I\u2019ve already mentioned, the blue light from your phones confuses your brain into thinking it\u2019s still daytime, and that disturbs your sleep cycle. So use your phone only when necessary, especially during the night, and when you do, turn on some sort of blue light filter. Most new phones come with an inbuilt feature for this.If you want to get rid of your phone addiction, check out some of my other articles on the topic in our publication Team XenoX, where I\u2019ve published some great guides on how to kill your phone addiction.In the end, try to go for a monthly eye checkup if you can. It\u2019ll give you an idea about whether these tweaks you\u2019ve made to your lifestyle are working. Get those glasses changed if necessary; using the wrong power can further harm your eyesight. And even if\/when your eyes are fully healed, make a habit of using Blue-cut glasses.Your eyes are arguably your most important asset, and believe me, you can\u2019t afford loosing them. Precaution is always better than the cure, and these tweaks won\u2019t take much of your time but can help you massively in the long term.If you found this helpful, don\u2019t forget to leave some claps \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc .

There are also deeper benefits, like releasing anxiety and negative thought patterns or just learning to sleep better.\u201dAfter two years, Ms Omnet said her goals for the studio had stayed the same.\u201cI wanted to create a calm, safe space for people to be able to release anxiety and stress\u201d. It\u2019s a very personal goal too, as yoga has helped me a lot.\u201dAfter being diagnosed with coeliac disease, Ms Omnet spent a long time on the road to recovery.\u201cThere was a lot of healing that I needed to be doing. I needed the slow, soft, mindful healing. It really worked for me and I think a lot of other people need that too.\u201dAfter working as a personal trainer at a gym, Ms Omnet said her teaching skills came in handy at the studio.\u201cI knew that the gym wasn\u2019t for me. I still use it and love it but it\u2019s not where I wanted to be as a teacher.\u201dA variety of international teachers will visit Bliss Studio this year to teach and speak to the budding yogis.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have people from the USA, Canada, Brisbane and Hong Kong come here for a bit of guest teaching and speaking. The studio will hopefully become a constantly evolving teaching schedule. Some of them might stay here for a month while I go away.\u201dDon\u2019t worry, though \u2014 she will not be gone for long.\u201cI absolutely plan to stick around for a few more years.\u201dWell done Jae! We are so proud of how far you have come and your dedication and passion for sharing the benefits of yoga with your community.Article republished from The Oamaru Mail. read the article in its original form here.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~To begin YOUR yoga journey visit Level 1 RYT-200 Yoga Teacher training page and start the first step along your new path today.We can\u2019t wait to share the journey with youWritten byWritten by","7789":"Megan Ramos and I started using intermittent fasting in the Intensive Dietary Management program sometime around 2013. At the time, the entire notion of fasting smelled faintly of quackery. The prevailing wisdom was that skipping meals was an entirely suicidal idea, from a weight standpoint. After all, everybody \u2018knew\u2019 that skipping meals would make you so ravenously hungry that you would be helpless to resist stuffing donuts by the box into your mouth.Dr. Michael Mosley and myselfIndeed, when we started, I had never heard anybody talk about fasting. It just sort of occurred to me one day that if you wanted to lose weight, then maybe just not eating was a good idea. I was a physician, and I ask people to fast all the time. When people go for surgery, they need to fast the night before. When people go for a colonoscopy, they need to fast for 24\u201348 hours. When people go for fasting bloodwork, they need to fast. So, I knew that fasting wasn\u2019t completely out of the question.But nevertheless, my initial reaction to this thought was that it would never work. But then I paused. I thought to myself \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t it work?\u2019 There really was no reason. I also had a good understanding of human physiology and knew that the body stored fat in case there was nothing to eat. So, if we gave our body the chance, it would have to burn this fat that was so carefully stored. So, I set out to research it. There was almost nothing written in the last 40 years. A couple of body builders had written some excellent material on intermittent fasting, but I was more interested in using fasting for therapeutic purposes of curing disease. In 2012, Dr. Michael Mosley at the BBC had produced a great documentary on the subject. But that was about it.So, we just started treating patients with various fasting protocols. And the results were simply stunning. We had patients reverse their long standing type 2 diabetes in mere months. We had patients lose hundreds of pounds. Not everybody did it, of course, but those that did, generally lost weight. After all, if you don\u2019t eat, you will generally lose weight. But everybody still thought I was crazy, batsh** stupid. I heard it from doctors. I heard it from dieticians. I heard it from nurses. I heard it from personal trainers.Around then, I started giving lectures at Low Carb High Fat\/ Ketogenic conferences. This was a few years ago, so most people thought eating lots of fat was really crazy. Ketogenic diets, since then, have become quite mainstream, with Keto cookbooks regularly in the best sellers lists. And in this room of \u2018crazy\u2019 dieters, people would look at me and think \u2018This guy is crazy\u2019. My, my. How things have changed in a few short years.In 2018, the annual Food & Health survey done by the International Food Information Council Foundation found that about 1\/3 of consumers follow a diet. The most popular? Intermittent fasting at about 10% of dieters, which is double that of Low-carb and Whole 30 (at 5% each). That\u2019s pretty incredible because fasting is completely different from all the other diets. Most diets concern themselves with the question of \u2018What\u2019 to eat. Fasting focuses on \u2018When\u2019 to eat. You can add fasting to any of the other diets, whether it is paleo, keto, vegan, or whatever. Adding therapeutic options for weight loss can only be a good thing.The same survey also found that people increasingly blamed sugar (33%) and carbohydrates (25%) for weight gain, which is almost double the percent that blamed dietary fat. In the 1990s any type of fat was considered fattening. We had low fat everything. But eating low fat foods like white bread, pasta and jellybeans certainly did nothing to help weight loss efforts to the amazement of the Dietary Guidelines people, who have continuously stressed fat reduction as their core message for good health. You can\u2019t fool people forever.Google Trends shows the same increasing interest in intermittent fasting. Up to about 2016, when I wrote The Obesity Code and The Complete Guide to Fasting, there was a low level interest in the topic. After 2016, interest has grown significantly. There are more than 3 times the number of daily searches on the topic.2018 seems to be the year that intermittent fasting is really catching the attention of the mainstream. An article in Good Morning America quoted Robin Foroutan, a registered dietician and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietitics, the main governing body for dieticians in the United States saying \u201cIt\u2019s nice when something is popular and actually safe\u201d. Wow. Fasting went from being a completely crazy idea in 2013 to a practice called popular AND safe by dieticians. For those who have trouble during fasting, new products are appearing, which is fantastic and gives people more options. A new line of Fasting Tea was released this year to help with hunger pangs during fasting. Our own IDM program is building a community around helping others fast, and also providing personalized counselling.Yahoo wrote about \u201cHow Intermittent Fasting helped this man with his 125 pound weight loss\u201c. This wasn\u2019t just an ordinary man. This was a doctor, who had just finished years of medical training who turned to intermittent fasting to help with his own personal weight problem. He was able to lose weight, and to keep it off, he turned to intermittent fasting, a practice that has been used since the dawn of humanity. Obviously, if physicians are using it themselves, they must obviously believe it is something healthy and sustainable. The hardest part of the weight loss journey is not losing the weight. The hardest part is keeping it off, and that is where fasting can really give people options.Even respected academic institutions like Harvard have come around in their thinking. In a recent Harvard Health Blog, Dr. Tello wrote a \u2018surprising update\u2019 on intermittent fasting \u2014 it just might work. She quotes Harvard University\u2019s Dr. Wexler, Director of the Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes Center \u201cThere is evidence to suggest that the circadian rhythm fasting approach, where meals are restricted to an eight to 10-hour period of the daytime, is effective\u201d.The advice to eat 6 or 8 or 10 times a day and to always eat breakfast even if not hungry was never rooted in any science. There were no studies to show that this sort of advice actually worked. But if you don\u2019t eat, then people can\u2019t sell you products. So, eating all the time was good for business even if not good for your waist line. Repeated often enough, this advice to eat 10 small meals per day gained a sheen of respectability that was never deserved. If you are not hungry, then don\u2019t eat. That seems pretty logical. Instead, we believed, and told our children that \u201cEven if you are not hungry, you must shove some granola bars into your mouth or you\u2019ll be unhealthy\u201d. Then we turn around and wonder we have a childhood obesity crisis.My son, this week went to a school camp for robotics. On the parents information, they reassured me that they will provide my child with lunch and 2 snacks per day. ARGHH. Why does my child, or any child need 2 snacks? Yet, because it comes from the school means that we are indoctrinating our kids to believe they must eat constantly to be healthy. By contrast, in the 1970s, when I grew up, nobody, but nobody ate snacks. Obesity, not such a problem.Written byWritten by","7792":"I Love. I see. I feel.

I read about it online, wondering what exactly the symptoms are. My mother was diagnosed a couple years ago as well.When an acquaintance saw how I was rubbing my neck and shoulders\u00a0quite\u00a0often, she asked if perhaps I had this obscure disorder.Back\u00a0in\u00a0my\u00a0home\u00a0province, I asked my previous doctor for a referral to a rheumatologist. I had the standard blood work done to see if I had the rh factor for rheumatoid arthritis.Since it was negative, which was a relief, the apparent need was deemed unnecessary. I understand there\u2019s a huge waiting list for specialists, but rhuematoid arthritis is certainly not the only existing chronic pain condition.So much for that\u2026 I was told to go to physical therapy\u00a0.Ummm, no thanks. If I were so inclined, I\u2019d look up the exercises online and do them. The commute, waiting and so on. Not to mention the out of pocket expenses.Being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia is more of a ruling out of other health issues.There are many aspects to Fibromyalgia:And many more.It tends to affect women over 40, more often than men. While there is no known cause, it may be brought on by past trauma, or other underlying issues.I\u2019m quite grateful I now have a good doctor that truly listens, and I did not have to wait several months for an appointment.I actually felt relief knowing that it is an overall condition. The pain I feel, is not due multiple issues. It\u2019s an all encompassing condition.I haven\u2019t yet decided on a course of action. I\u2019m definitely not too keen on taking prescription pain medication It is a very slippery slope fall down.Plus, im.of the opinion, I need to keep what wits I have left, right? As it is, I feel like I\u2019m barely treading water at times.Meanwhile, I know what I\u2019m dealing with and will set limits for myself,I still have a ways to go in the self-care arena. I tend to be harsh on myself at times and then, while other times, I\u2019d likely benefit from a swift kick in the ol \u2019hiney!Sometimes just knowing something gives a measure of peace.Ignorance is not blissful when one conjures up all the reasons causing your pain and grief.So for now, I must bid you adieu!Written byWritten by","7869":"\u201cThe engine isn\u2019t turning over today,\u201d I texted my friend, in response to the boilerplate question, \u201cHow are you?\u201dYou know the feeling: you\u2019re just not firing on all cylinders. You don\u2019t want to work. You want to get out of bed, but you just can\u2019t. The bills and to-dos are piling up, and so are the dishes. Everyone\u2019s an extra asshole. The world\u2019s out to get you.I have moments \u2014 fewer now than a year ago, but still moments \u2014 when I\u2019m like this and then some. When I\u2019m not at my best. When I\u2019m actively engaged in self-sabotage. When, from the outside, I look lazy, apathetic and miserable. Let\u2019s talk about what that feels like from the inside.Below is a list of how I feel and behave when I\u2019m mentally ill.These may or may not present all at the same time, and the vary in degrees of severity. But they are all symptoms I\u2019ve observed over the past few years on days when I\u2019m \u201coff-peak,\u201d or \u201cnot feeling myself.\u201d They are a seemingly diverse array of symptoms that fall into several different buckets \u2014 toggling between the physical, mental and emotional. They defy easy treatment: anti-depressants don\u2019t work well, ADHD medication either cures or exasperates them, anti-psychotics make me sleepy. That said: benzodiazepines work and they work well. This would, naturally, believe you to this ladders up neatly to an anxiety disorder. And you\u2019re probably right. That said, it isn\u2019t a persistent anxiety disorder. It only happens sometimes. Let\u2019s dive into what those times look like.Below is a list of conditions that bring on or exacerbate the symptoms.You can see from this list that some of these triggers can begat other triggers. For example, a hangover can snowball into social isolation. Clutter can cause stress. These conditions were initially difficult to identify because they so often occur in tandem with each other, but spending the past year making substantial lifestyle changes has led me to single them out and parse through them. Many of these are, \u201cwell, no shit\u201d obvious roads to lapses in mental and emotional health, and cause me to function at a sub-optimal level, experiencing the cornucopia of symptoms identified at the top of the page. So what do I call this mish-mash of mental mayhem? I\u2019ve given it it\u2019s own cute little name: \u201cThe Glitch.\u201d It\u2019s short, simple and catchy \u2014 and naming it was the first step on the road to recovery.I\u2019ve always known something was \u201coff\u201d with me. As a kid, I was often called \u201cforgetful\u201d or \u201cthe absent-minded professor.\u201d As a young adult, I\u2019d often feel out of control, or that the locus of control for my happiness lay outside the realm of my own responsibility.I\u2019d often complain about \u201cthe engine not turning over,\u201d or feeling like \u201cI have two brain cells left and can\u2019t rub them together to get a spark.\u201d I couldn\u2019t quite put my finger on exactly what was wrong, because the symptoms were so all over the place and the causes weren\u2019t immediately clear, but that all changed one day earlier this year.I woke up one morning, late for work and in a total fog. I mainlined two cups of coffee but was still yawning on my commute. I mainlined even more caffeine in the office, and by 11 a.m., I was experiencing panic, hypochondria, confusion, palpitations, restlessness, resentfulness, stress, anxiety, anger, GI issues and sadness. I couldn\u2019t identify what was wrong with me. I checked myself into a hospital by 12:30, and took 0.5 mg of xanax to test and see if I was merely having an anxiety attack. By 1:15, while waiting for my doctor, I had fallen into a peaceful sleep. I was woken up, and they asked me if I wanted additional testing. I said no and was released.When I got home, I decided to make myself a salad, unplug from screens and resolved to just lay down and rest. I took an additional 0.5 mg of Xanax and slept for 14 hours. I woke up for work the next day refreshed and relaxed. And that\u2019s when I started exploring.A friend called to check up on me, and as I sussed out why I felt the way I did, and established some distance between my symptoms and my state of mind later in the evening, I was able to describe the way I felt \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s like I short-circuited. It happens sometimes, but usually not so severe. It\u2019s like a glitch.\u201d\u201cThe Glitch\u201d is exactly what it is. It\u2019s a bug inside of me \u2014 not a feature. It\u2019s a sudden, temporary malfunction of my own mind. It compounds upon itself, and until the glitch is fixed, it spreads, causing misfires in areas like mental clarity, happiness, tranquility, empathy, stability and amiability. It has cognitive, emotional and physical components. And what\u2019s great about \u201cThe Glitch\u201d is how naming it clued me in to how to treat and prevent it.Naming my mental illness \u201cThe Glitch\u201d allows me the freedom to remind myself that who I am in my glitchy moments is not who I actually am. I am not forgetful, sad, anxious, lazy and weird when I\u2019m functioning normally. I do not feel the judgment I\u2019d otherwise I feel if I just ascribed these traits to my character. It\u2019s given me freedom, and the clarity to search for causes \u2026 and a cure.It\u2019s not a DSM-V term. It\u2019s no substitute for a clinical mental health evaluation. What it is, though, is something I can use to describe myself, and a way for me to recognize when I\u2019m not right. I can say to friends, \u201cI\u2019m feeling glitchy today,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m glitching out,\u201d and we\u2019ll both know exactly what that means. And I\u2019ll also know how to fix it and prevent future glitches. Let\u2019s explore that.Below are a list of steps I can take when I\u2019m experiencing \u201cThe Glitch\u201d to lessen the severity of it and shorten its duration.I do those things in that order, and I run down the list until I no longer feel glitchy. They always work, and I often don\u2019t need to go any farther than the run (although I often do).Below are a series of measures I can take to protect myself against future glitches. You may remember them from here:I used to glitch every day \u2014 often severely. I wrote this while glitching, about glitching:Now I don\u2019t. I generally only glitch on nights after I binge-drink now, and I can count on one hand the number of times I\u2019ve done that in the past year.Here\u2019s where I land on this: I\u2019m not a doctor or clinical psychologist, or even a licensed therapist or counselor, or a registered nurse. I\u2019m just an ordinary man with some lived-in experience regarding my own mental health challenges. Since naming and treating them, I\u2019ve become kinder, clearer, healthier and more productive. Your mileage may vary.If I could offer any practical advice, it\u2019s this: Take ownership of your mental wellness. Regularly take inventory about how you feel and what you feel \u2014 jot down your symptoms, your emotions and your thoughts. Do this without judgment. (I know, it\u2019s hard.) Then, try to systematically identify their causes and triggers. Once you do that, you\u2019ll have a better chance of finding actionable pathways to treatment and prevention of the challenges that plague you.And, most importantly of all, know this: You are not defined by your mental health challenges. You are not you on your off-days. You are you on your on-days. Be kind to yourself. Take care of yourself. You might just find that you\u2019re worth being kind to and taking care of. I think so, anyway. I think we\u2019re all worth that, and a lot of the world\u2019s problems would subside if more of us felt that way.Written byWritten by","7929":"Ask people how they feel about getting older, and they will probably reply in the same vein as Maurice Chevalier: \u201cOld age isn\u2019t so bad when you consider the alternative.\u201d Stiffening joints, weakening muscles, fading eyesight and the clouding of memory, coupled with the modern world\u2019s careless contempt for the old, seem a fearful\u2026","8012":"Other than my years of being bullied, friendships were good overall. By 11th grade\u2026and college\u2026and early years of my career, friends were sprinkled throughout. Not many, but enough. None lasted, although I thought they would. As much as I tried to keep them near, they drifted further and further away. Eventually, I stopped trying. I\u2019d converse with my colleagues at work, but doing anything outside of work or home became extremely rare.No opportunity to be socially awkward. Completely ingrained in my being is the need to feel accepted, most likely stemming from harassment dished out by my peers in elementary school. I hated letting anyone down. I became a perpetual people-pleaser\u2026even to my own detriment. Putting on a mask eventually became my default\u2026being who and what I felt others expected of me. In this way, I felt acceptance\u2026even if it were false acceptance.With the onset of social media, I could now reach out to others from the comfort of my own home. I can chat with friends, share what I\u2019ve been up to, and still hide what I feel may push people away. I enjoy having pocket friends (they all fit in my pocket via mobile phone).On May 29, 2017, I launched a blog. I decided it was time to embrace at least one aspect of myself that I attempted to shroud. My bipolar. On June 8, 2017, I laid out my lifelong struggles with mental health in one fell swoop of a post. Hitting the publish button frightened me to the core. I then awaited the aftermath.Much to my surprise, I received an avalanche of positive feedback, which you may view at the end of this post. I also received feedback from \u201cfixers\u201d who feel like they know mental illness, yet don\u2019t: you need to rely more on God, you need to try yoga, you need to try such-and-such diet, you need to try natural supplements instead of drugs, and one piercing opinion from a relative: therapy without God is just psycho-babble (how dare I see a psychiatrist\u2026the only one who was able to save my life\u2026instead of a minister). As I\u2019ve stated before, management of a mental illness is a multifarious process and different for everyone. There is no \u201cmagic pill cure\u201d.\u2192Family better understands me\u2026or at least tries.\u2192Some just don\u2019t get it and choose to ignore my elephant in the room, they and walk on eggshells around me. Is what it is.\u2192Life can still be lonely. I oftentimes feel silently judged or misunderstood.\u2192I\u2019ve gained new friends via social media, in particular Facebook and Twitter. There\u2019s an entire online community of others who genuinely understand\u2026because they live with a mental illness, too. Understanding is a huge part of acceptance. I may never meet them in person, but the bond is strong and fast among those who \u201chave been there\u201d. I love and adore my bipolar buddies and mental illness battlers.

Paralleling this, in certain circles, is an ever-growing interest in \u201cscientifically proving\u201d (or disproving) the effectiveness of meditation. In this I see dangers abounding that could hurt all of us: those who practice meditation and those who could benefit from doing so.There is a conceit underlying the idea that meditation has not been proven effective by long-term, objective research already. The conceit appears to be founded on the belief that for thousands of years, the hundreds of millions of humans who have thought their dedicated practice was useful and effective were deluding themselves because they had no \u201cscientific\u201d evidence. Their delusion may have been based in spiritual beliefs or because of positive placebo effects that they naively took to be evidence of effectiveness. This belief seems to also suggest that \u201cscience\u201d never existed before it was created by Europeans, and thus, there could be no rigorous testing of these techniques in their originating cultures.The hubris in this conceit is an excellent example of the kind of self-delusion that spiritual traditions have specifically used meditation to break free from. This raises the question of whether a non-meditator can even understand the goal of meditation; the issue being the difference between a conceptual idea about something and a direct experience of it.We can see the defects caused by this conceit already present in so-called \u201csecular meditation,\u201d which is how meditation seems to be marketed, packaged, and sold today. The thinking appears to be that the explanatory spiritual doctrines that usually accompany traditional meditation practices are not important and can be jettisoned in favor of defining a completely secular technique for meditators to use.But this assumes that the goal of meditation is something physical and concrete. This has never been the goal of meditation. This faulty understanding of meditation appears specifically in research efforts to record physical effects of meditation in the brain. The disparity here is that the absence of such effects is seen as evidence of the ineffectiveness of meditation, while the presence of it becomes evidence of possible effectiveness.Meditation initially develops one\u2019s focus of attention and concentration. Yet scientists are still trying to work out how the brain attends to anything at all \u2014 such as selecting a particular object in the visual field. Can science measure \u201cdevelopment of attentional focus\u201d if attention itself is still an unknown?Meditation also allows one to directly experience the nature of the mind, but for science, there is no \u201cmind,\u201d only a brain. And, at best, its \u201ccontents\u201d might be called the \u201cmind,\u201d but not in the sense meant by spiritual traditions. Can a scientist, then, study the effectiveness of meditation if they cannot fully comprehend its focus?Most scientific studies stick to attention and concentration\u2014i.e., \u201cmindfulness\u201d\u2014and what their development provides people. But they do so while ignoring what happens when an individual\u2019s meditation naturally glides from the initial development of attention and concentration into a direct experience of mind; or that of the lack of any inherent self-existence, qualities, or identity in anything; or the spontaneous nature of all that is believed to be intentionally caused. Such experiences can occur sporadically and without warning. They aren\u2019t physical effects in the brain, nor doctrinal ideas learned from someone. Instead, these are direct experiences of the nature of the mind that don\u2019t compute in a secular context for a strict disciple of the worldview of physicalism.For instance, Ute Kreplin, a psychology lecturer at Massey University in New Zealand, wrote an essay in Aeon magazine, asking \u201cDoes meditation work?\u201d But the essay focused on whether research into its effectiveness met scientific standards. The question of standards is an appropriate one\u2014in relation to the study of modern secularized techniques of meditation. The focus of the question is constrained, however, by the nature of the actual subject of these research efforts: secularized meditation techniques that have been warped to focus on the manifestation of \u201cside effects\u201d of traditional meditation.What is actually being studied, then, is characterized by Kreplin as the \u201celimination or reduction of stress, anxiety and depression, as well as bipolar disorder, eating disorders, diabetes, substance abuse, chronic pain, blood pressure, cancer, autism and schizophrenia.\u201d While these are all worthwhile and positive effects, they are only possible side effects of traditional meditation, not its actual goal.Just because a three-week meditation course is being marketed doesn\u2019t mean a three-week study can give any relevant data about the effectiveness of meditation.The research efforts that are the subject of her essay may be the result of a desire to enhance the marketability of a product or service by giving it some scientific \u201ccred,\u201d but the presence or absence of these side effects doesn\u2019t evidence of the effectiveness of meditation \u2014 which includes traditional meditation, not just secularized meditation.In the article, Kreplin references a widely shared quote, often attributed to the Dalai Lama: \u201cIf every eight-year-old in the world were taught meditation, the world would be without violence in one generation.\u201d She uses this as a theme to point out the inadequacy of certain scientific research efforts on meditation and its side effects \u2014 specifically \u201cenhanced compassion.\u201d Kreplin references a study where individuals participated in an eight-week program of meditation, and the authors reached a finding of improved compassion across participants based on questionnaire responses before and after their eight-week course of meditation. Kreplen criticizes the lack of an active control group (i.e., a group of individuals who were also instructed to do something other than meditating, such as listening to lectures about compassion in this case, rather than doing nothing), stating: \u201chere the results of our analysis suggest that meditation per se does not, alas, make the world a more compassionate place.\u201dBut is that an objective takeaway?While the absence of an active control group, as opposed to an inactive one, is a valid criticism of the study, it\u2019s not an automatic rebuttal of the effectiveness of meditation. That popular Dalai Lama quote points out the effect of every child around the world being taught to meditate\u2014and doing so continuously for a generation, a vague term for a span of time approximately the difference in age between children and their parents. Is it scientifically rigorous to apply the results of an experiment with a term of a few weeks to an assertion about something that would take about 20 years to accomplish? Also, we don\u2019t know if the referenced study used the specific meditation practice the Dalai Lama was referring to\u2014and there are many, each geared to a certain goal or the use of a different support.There is an unwarranted and unproven assumption across scientific studies of meditation that the results of meditation are accomplished linearly, e.g., eight weeks is sufficient to test a practice\u2019s results. Research would have to prove first that meditation was effective at all before it could attempt to prove it was linearly effective, which would have to come before a reliance on protocols for research over short durations. The latter two steps have not been done, and Kreplin takes as a given that the first hasn\u2019t as well.Can researchers validly perform curt examinations of techniques that are meant to be practiced over a lifetime\u2014or at least decades\u2014for their effects to take hold? Just because a three-week meditation course is being marketed doesn\u2019t mean a three-week study can give any relevant data about the effectiveness of meditation or generate any useful data at all.Kreplin also seems to misunderstand that any mental effort can be used as a support for meditation. Her example of a concocted 71-page manual describing the rationale and benefits of a nonexistent meditation technique is not inherently a placebo as she suggests. Especially when participants, who were considered in this instance to be the control group, were instructed to sit quietly for 20 minutes twice per day in a dark room and think of anything they wanted. Depending on how they were attending to their thoughts\u2014as opposed to the contents of those thoughts\u2014this could easily have been a very effective form of meditation. In fact, using thoughts as a support for meditation is a well-known type of traditional practice. Kreplin makes no mention of how these participants could be instructed to not meditate on their thoughts\u2014and that, I argue, is a widespread fault of secularized meditation research.By not understanding that the focus of traditional meditation is on the mind (as the traditions define it, not as science does today), researchers might think that this example represented a valid control group. When they saw no difference in the results obtained by the two groups\u2014only one of which was deemed to be meditating\u2014they \u201cfound\u201d that meditation was no more effective than sitting quietly in a darkened room thinking. But such a \u201cfinding\u201d hardly seems valid.Kreplin goes on to detail important considerations about the techniques used to scientifically study secular meditation, as well as important considerations for the investigators themselves, such as experimenter bias and confirmation bias. She also discusses selectively chosen results that are deemed material, rather than marginal, and the problem of demand characteristics that may be present in the protocol and can lead participants to \u201cbehave or respond in a way that they think is in line with the expectations of the researcher.\u201d All of these are important considerations for structuring a research protocol, but they do not overcome the deficiencies implicit with studies of meditation overall.Kreplin also turns her attention to the problem of \u201cnegative side effects\u201d of meditation, a mischaracterization of well-known and understood direct results of traditional meditation. These can become negative when they occur in a secular setting with uninformed or inexperienced teachers. By failing to comprehend, or actively ignoring, the actual goal of traditional meditation\u2014while reformulating ancient techniques into a secularized form stripped of accompanying doctrinal context\u2014paying customers face the possibility of intense disorientation that could result in mental illness if they\u2019re left to fend for themselves, which can occur in secular contexts.In traditional meditation practice, the selection criteria is focused on making sure that people being taught meditation are qualified to handle the expected results. They are taught under the guidance of an experienced meditator within an explanatory framework; no such criteria seems to be used for current secular meditation programs and applications.Meditation is presumed to deliver results in a smooth linear fashion, which experienced meditators know is false, and this presumption is used to validate the short-term duration of most experiments.The disorientation people can experience, such as the so-called \u201cdark night\u201d mentioned in Kreplin\u2019s essay, is not a side effect of traditional meditation. Rather, it can be a documented sign of progress that can be competently handled by experienced guides in those traditions. But this can become a real danger in secularized meditation taught by unknowing teachers who think the only results of meditating are the main selling points, like stress reduction.Kreplin does acknowledge this, saying: \u201cIn Buddhist circles, these so-called \u2018dark nights\u2019 are part of meditation. In an ideal situation, \u2018dark nights\u2019 are worked through with an experienced teacher under the framework of Buddhist teachings, but what about those who don\u2019t have such a teacher or who meditate in a secular context?\u201d The issue, though, is not with meditation overall. It is that secularized meditation is not the same thing as traditional meditation, for exactly the points she makes: the absence of an experienced teacher (from a tradition) and a framework of teachings (Buddhist, in her example).But Kreplin lumps all meditation practices and settings together and then becomes alarmed at what happens with a particular kind of meditation in a particular context:The absence of reported adverse effects in the current literature might be accidental, but it is more likely that those suffering from them believe that such effects are a part of meditation, or they don\u2019t connect them to the practice in the first place. Considering its positive image and the absence of negative reports on meditation, it is easy to think that the problem lies within. In the best-case scenario, one might simply stop meditating, but many webpages and articles often frame these negative or ambivalent feelings as a part of meditation that will go away with practice. Yet continuing to practice can result in a full-blown psychotic episode (at worst), or have more subtle adverse effects.This particular issue is not going to be settled anytime soon, as is evident in Kreplin\u2019s closing remarks focused on \u201cthe limitations of meditation and its adverse effects.\u201d While she calls for a more balanced view of meditation, her focus is only on the effectiveness claims of secularized meditation. She does not mean that science should accept the non-material nature of the goal of traditional meditation, a failing that dooms us to the \u201cwarped\u201d understanding that she blames on the techniques of meditation, rather than on the interpreters, marketers, and beneficiaries of the modern secular version.The danger is that most modern research efforts into the effectiveness of meditation are directed toward the potential side effects, both good and bad, of secularized\u2014and preliminary level\u2014meditation only, yet the results of such limited studies seem to be applied to all meditation, including traditional meditation practices. In addition, researchers are disadvantaged by a worldview that specifically excludes the actual focus of traditional meditation practices\u2014which is the mind\u2014and they cannot recognize certain experiences for what they are.Finally, meditation is presumed to deliver results in a smooth linear fashion, which experienced meditators know is false, and this presumption is used to validate the short-term duration of most experiments. Researchers who are not advanced meditators themselves do not have the contextual experience necessary to be able to construct a fault-free research protocol because they don\u2019t understand what is and isn\u2019t meditation.Written byWritten by","8051":"It started in a spiral notebook. I wasn\u2019t even five years old, yet, I\u2019d already developed an unruly obsession with the Dow Jones. Not in investing, just in the numbers themselves, the way they\u2019d somewhat arbitrarily move up or down, and then get charted in technicolor by USA Today.And, so, I asked myself what most kids fresh out of Pre-K would: \u201cWhat if I measured my life like the stock market?\u201d For real. Look how happy, healthy and well-adjusted I turned out.I determined that at the closing bell on Friday each week, I would ask myself how the week was, and assign it a number: I\u2019d jot that number down in the notebook. Then, I\u2019d do it again, and add or subtract that number from the previous one. From there, I\u2019d be able to develop an objective, quantitative response to, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d I did this in lieu of a diary, because, why the hell would I want to write my every waking thought? I mean \u2026 who does that?In 1993, I developed a set of five criteria to develop more consistent results:I measured each variable on a scale of -2 to 2, so that a perfect week was a 10, a total disaster was -10, and an average week was zero. (I once measured each variable from 1 to 5, switched to the current scale in 2001, and went back and retroactively adjusted the previous data.) I would average out the weekly totals out at the end of each month, to prevent too much noise in the data. (So, although I took the temperature weekly, only the average temperature for the month is what made it into the master data set.)Now, who\u2019s ready to see some fucking graphs?Look at that beauty. It is my entire life \u2014 every kiss, dollar, disappointment, achievement, party, playground, concert, hug, disease, soccer match, conference call \u2014 in one chart. That\u2019s over 30 years, from just shy of my 5th birthday to just shy of my 36th. It\u2019s kinda ridiculous. But it\u2019s instructive. Come \u2026 navel-gaze with me. (You are welcome to skip the chart-by-chart breakdown and skip to where it says \u201cLife Lessons\u201d if this feels too much like nerdy masochism for you.)This chart covers my entire life from the time my time spent swinging on the playground in Madison, Alabama to the minute my mom\u2019s van drove me and my family out of our home in Niagara Falls to our new home in the Utica area. It loosely correlates to K-5th grade, and covers a lot of playing baseball with neighborhood kids and drawing creepily accurate street maps of various U.S. metro areas in sidewalk chalk on my driveway.Here, the data is pretty clear. The dip between July of \u201987 and May of \u201988 was Kindergarten in Alabama, where the memories are fuzzy and I don\u2019t remember making real friends, and I suffered from constant asthma attacks. The gentle climb from May of \u201988 to March of \u201992 was a steady stream of birthday parties, solid scores on standardized tests, a youth filled with being the teacher\u2019s pet and someone who always listened to his parents, played pickup baseball games and generally enjoyed being alive. The hockey-stick skyrocket on the far right represents just totally killing it in 5th grade and essentially running the school, right up until my friends blocked my mom\u2019s van from leaving the neighborhood when it became clear I was not coming back for junior high.Pluses:Minuses:This chart covers my entire life from the time my time spent in the greater Utica area, covering the start of being the \u201cnew kid\u201d in sixth grade to waving goodbye to my parents before heading into the Brewster dormitory at Syracuse University. This is grades 6 through 12. Here, we have growth spurts, voice changes, first awkward dates and kisses, first overseas trips and a lot of playing AYSO soccer and drumming in concert bands.Here, the data tells a somewhat rockier story. The precipitous drop from August of \u201993 until May of \u201995 tells the story of a gangly, lonely kid who got picked on a lot in middle school, didn\u2019t get invited out a ton, and went to bed to the dulcet tones of his parents arguing. May of \u201995, however, yielded the first of many fortuitous standout moments: The Great Virginia Beach Marching Band Trip, which was my first unsupervised road trip without my parents chaperoning \u2014 this is when I finally fell in with a group of real friends, and where I picked up sarcasm as a defense mechanism for my unrelenting earnestness.The following 18 months was a bull market highlighted by being named All-State in Percussion, Winning the Geography Bee, traveling to the British Isles and seeing my first concert, kissing my first kiss, uttering my first (of many!) curse words, drinking my first shot of whiskey, and just generally bad-assing my way through the eighth grade.Freshman year was freshman year, sophomore year was spectacular, junior year was spent in a relationship that did some toxic damage to my other relationships. Let\u2019s talk, again, about the (mostly) unbroken vault upwards at the right side of the graph.By the end of senior year, I: played three varsity sports, ran my first two 15K road races, hiked the highest peaks in the Adirondacks, was first-chair percussion in every band our school had, graduated with high honors, got accepted into Syracuse University to study Broadcast Journalism, was in a committed relationship with my high-school sweetheart, had a tight group of friends and an even tighter group of acquaintances, and was generally killing it in every sense of the word. I never expected, five years earlier, that this peak would dwarf the one in the Summer of 1993, but the Summer of 2000 did just that.Pluses:Minuses:This chart covers the time I said hello to my roommate in the Brewster dormitory at Syracuse University to the time I finished my last final exam at the University at Buffalo. Here, we largely see existential crises, frequent psuedo-philosophical epiphanies, being an actual weatherman, habitual marijuana smoking, occasional binge drinking, frat parties, all-nighters, and pulling off the rare grade hat-trick of being on the Dean\u2019s List and Academic Probation in consecutive semesters: TWICE.The first thing that sticks out about this data is how little it moves over four years. College was neither good, nor bad. I mean, it was a lot of both, but it almost always balanced each other out. My grandfather died. I got arrested a couple times. I started playing concerts. I traveled a ton. I dumped my high school sweetheart, linked up with a hippie, pledged a fraternity, tended bar to make ends meet, struggled to make ends meet, partied and also spent a lot of time eating pasta alone and watching Mountain West Conference college football.With one, glaring, massive exception, that pronounced uptick in the middle: February through September of 2002. This is when I discovered Adderall. I first took 10mg before I took to the stage in a punk band I was in at the time, and it was a revelation. I\u2019m generally a scatter-brained mess of a human, multi-tasking ad infinitum. But I was able to slow down and truly engage with the world.I started taking 5mg at 8a.m., 5mg at noon, and 5mg at 5 p.m. every single day. Here\u2019s what happened:I probably have ADHD.Pluses:Minuses:This covers the period of time from when I stopped going to school until when I loaded up all my belongings in a Hyundai Sonata and drove to Austin to start a new life. Here, we find my first two post-second-college professional jobs, the beginning of my fledgling music career, the beginning of my marginally more successful sports-writing career, and a LOT of time spent out till 4 a.m. in dive bars and talking on the Internet to strangers.2005 contained a DWI arrest \u2014 but not a conviction, my BAC wasn\u2019t high enough, recreational cocaine use from January through June, a bizarre firing from my restaurant job and money troubles caused by a combination of the first three things. Then, I settled down, got a pretty great girlfriend, and a telemarketing job that transformed into a job doing Database Administration. (An I.T. job? Sure! Why not?) That\u2019s the uptick in 2006.After a brief down-period in the Winter of 2007\u20132008, what follows is a beautiful upward slope. I reconnected with my high school sweetheart who was living in NYC at the time, and there was an enjoyable bit of nostalgic romance. I got a new job working from home for a boutique ad agency and worked with talented people across the country. I traveled damn near everywhere I could. I started playing music. I met an incredible, supportive group of friends that I still call friends and are probably going to be the pallbearers at my funeral. I crafted a pretty great relationship with my dad. I wasn\u2019t making a ton of money, or practicing a lot of healthy habits aside from running and bike riding, but I was generally pretty happy, self-sufficient and successful.2010, I decided it was time to leave Buffalo, to venture out into the world and see how great life could be. After narrowing it down to a short list of cities, I visited them all and chose Austin. In parallel, I\u2019d met a woman who made me very happy, who just so happened to live in San Antonio. 2010 was also when I coined the term \u201cVictory Lap.\u201d A Victory Lap is that feeling you get when you know you\u2019re on the precipice of a major life change, so you start cashing in all your chips in a series of heat checks, and they all tend to work out really well and be a ton of fun. That\u2019s the upward arc on the right side. Looking back through time, 1993, 2000, 2002 and 2010 all fit neatly into this category. Those were the \u201cpeaks.\u201dPluses:Minuses:This chart covers everything from 1\/1\/11 \u2014 when I unloaded all my belongings out of my Hyundai Sonata and into my new apartment in the 512 area code up until present-day. Here contains a destructive series of events that led to me jobless, homeless, car-less and penniless by September of 2012, followed by gainful, meaningful employment doing what I love to do (writing things!) at a large, successful technology corporation. This chart also contains two long-term girlfriends; both relationships ended under vastly different circumstances. Writing and music take center-stage professionally. Mental health issues take center-stage personally.From January 2011 until September 2012, we see an incredible down-period. I had issues making the transition to Austin. I was laid off from one job and fired from another. I had a stable romantic relationship, but with a woman who lived just a bit too far away to be local, and so I never actually met anyone in town. I ran out of money. I became extremely anxious and depressed, and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I let my health slip.From September 2012 until July 2014, things stabilized and gradually improved. I started my job, and it quickly turned into my dream job. I started playing music again. I started writing again. I didn\u2019t really drink or smoke. I started running again. I did a fair amount of traveling. And, perhaps most importantly, I went and saw the right therapist at the right time, and she gave me a list of concrete steps to take my life from good to great. All of these were done in the first half of 2014, and the final step was \u201cbreak up with your girlfriend.\u201d Which I did in July.What followed after that, as you can see above, literally broke the data model. By the Spring of 2016, during a trip to Miami with the lady, I was off the charts. What you see is the single most productive, successful, happy, healthy, exciting, rewarding period of my entire life. I was promoted a couple times at work. I got a couple raises. I started writing for a national sports publication. I started writing about music. I recorded an album. I started a freelance branding company. I got sober. (And then started appreciating fine whiskey cocktails.) I ran several half marathons and did several bike races. I moved into a new condo. I had a lot of really interesting talks with really interesting people. I finally made enough money to pay off all my debt (incurred from earlier in the chart) and establish a nest-egg. I fell in love \u2014 really, really hard. My friends and I affectionately referred to this period as \u201cPeak-Gorman.\u201dFrom an all-time high on August 31, 2016, after a trip to Seattle with the lady, then we see a slow, steadily increasing arc back downward, which came to an abrupt halt on August 21, 2017. I got into a Twitter flareup that (briefly) ruined my writing career. I stopped playing music. I lost my girlfriend. I was sadder and more anxious than normal. I drank more than usual. I was not as healthy. I wasted more money than usual. (I did, however, see really great friends in New York and Chicago and Phoenix, so the news wasn\u2019t all bad.) This was a market correction. We\u2019ll talk about the abrupt uptick that follows it in the forthcoming section.Pluses:Minuses:Let\u2019s zoom in on the past year, shall we? This uptick looks quite gentle when framed over the course just one chart, but as you can tell from the widescreen views, this is quite a rampaging bull. So, what happened? Habit changing happened. Allow me to point you, once again, to this shining beacon of self improvement:Oh, did you think I was just writing about what I feel like you should do? Nah, B. Those 12\u2014 I hesitate to call them steps \u2014 ahem, strategies are my full-court press to treat my broken brain and my broken life. Even though I really only do them about 80% of the time, they\u2019re working \u2014 and not just a little bit. As a unit, they\u2019re the most effective life changes I\u2019ve ever introduced. Here was the rollout schedule:Has it worked? I don\u2019t mean to sound like a pompous prick or anything, but, like \u2026 life\u2019s as good as its ever been. And I\u2019ve got the data to back it up.Pluses:Minuses:Let\u2019s look at the full chart once again.Now that you\u2019ve had a chance to digest all that, here\u2019s a few takeaways worth talking about:5. Accumulate as little debt as possible. I shiver when I think about how high my present-day score would be had I not been flat broke until I was 30. I\u2019m just going to let that sit there. Since paying off over $57,000 in loans, collections, credit cards and other miscellaneous items, and getting to $0, I can breathe a lot easier. Which is huge for my mental health and helps me stay flexible.6. Invest in other people. My most rewarding relationships were forged by either running in the same circles and making it a point to keep showing up(Austin\u2019s music scene, Buffalo\u2019s \u201cwolf-pack [the pallbearers]\u201d) or by falling into people I\u2019ve really connected with on the Internet or through others. It\u2019s good to do good, show up for people, come through for them, and share things with them.Anyway, so that\u2019s some meta-analysis of my life. Did you make it through that slog of geeky Microsoft Excel goodness? Mercy.As a final point, I\u2019m not suggesting you incorporate this methodology of measuring yourself into your life. I\u2019m sure this seems unnecessarily comprehensive, patently ludicrous and \u2026 frankly \u2026 pathological in some respects. But, it does help to be mindful of how you\u2019re doing in the things that matter to you. Because unless you know what matters to you, and what the gap is between where you are in life and where you want to be, it\u2019s going to be pretty tough to make any sort of measurable improvement \u2014 no matter how you measure it.Written byWritten by","8065":"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has only been considered a disease in the last century, but it is actually an ancient disorder. Originally described as a gynecological curiosity, it has evolved into the most common endocrine disorder of young women, involving multiple organ systems. In ancient Greece, the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates (460BC-377BC), described \u201cwomen whose menstruation is less than three days or is meagre, are robust, with a healthy complexion and a masculine appearance; yet they are not concerned about bearing children nor do they become pregnant\u201d. This description of PCOS existed not only in ancient Greece, but is found in ancient medical texts throughout the world.Soranus of Ephesus (c. 98\u2013138 AD), near modern day Turkey, observed \u201cthat the majority of those (women) not menstruating are rather robust, like mannish and sterile women\u201d. The renaissance French barber surgeon and obstetrician Ambroise Par\u00e9 (1510\u20131590 AD) noted that many infertile women with irregular menses are \u201cstout, or manly women; therefore their voice is loud and bigge, like unto a mans, and they become bearded\u201d. It\u2019s quite an accurate description from a doctor who can apparently cut your hair, cut your leg off, or deliver children. The Italian scientist Antonio Vallisneri connected these masculinizing features with the abnormal shape of the ovaries into a single disease. He described several young, married infertile peasant women whose ovaries were shiny with a white surface and the size of pigeon eggsIn 1921, Achard and Thiers described a syndrome whose main features included masculinizing features (acne, balding or receding hairline, excessive facial hair) and type 2 diabetes. Further cases in 1928 cemented the link between what is now called PCOS with type 2 diabetes and described in the classic article \u2018Diabetes of Bearded Women\u2019.Careful observation had already revealed to these astute clinicians a syndrome whose main features included menstrual irregularities (now known to be anovulatory cycles), infertility, masculine features (hair growth), and stoutness (obesity) with its related type 2 diabetes. The only essential feature they missed from the modern definition of PCOS was the multiple cysts on the ovary, because of the lack of simple non-invasive imaging.The Modern EraDrs. Stein and Leventhal ushered in the modern era of PCOS in 1935 with their description of 7 women with all the current diagnostic features \u2014 masculinizing features, irregular menses and polycystic ovaries. The breakthrough occurred by making the connection between the lack of menstruation with the presence of enlarged ovaries and merging them into a single syndrome \u2014 PCOS. At that time, the detection of enlarged cystic ovaries was difficult and Stein and Leventhal achieved this either by direct surgical observation (laparotomy) or using a now-defunct x-ray technique called pneumoroentgenography. This procedure involved making an abdominal incision to introduce air and then taking x-rays. The shadow of the enlarged ovary could now be seen. However, in an era prior to effective antibiotics, this was a risky procedure.Dr. Stein hypothesized that some as yet undetermined hormonal imbalance caused the ovaries to become cystic and he suggested that surgically removing a wedge of the ovary may help reverse the syndrome. And indeed, this crude surgery worked. All seven women began to menstruate again and two even got pregnant. With its main features defined, interest in PCOS surged as reflected by the large increase in PCOS articles in the medical literature.Subsequently, Drs. Stein and Leventhal performed ovarian wedge resection on another 75 women with restoration of menstrual cycles in 90% of cases and restored fertility in 65%. Defining the syndrome and delineating a reasonable treatment was such an accomplishment that this disease became known as the Stein-Leventhal Syndrome. With the advent of modern medical solutions, particularly the medication clomiphene citrate, the ovarian wedge resection today is rarely done.Through the 1960s and 1970s, improved radioimmunoassay techniques allowed for easier detection of the typical hormonal abnormalities of PCOS. The masculine appearance was caused largely by excessive male sex hormones called androgens, of which testosterone is the best known. The biochemical diagnosis of PCOS is problematic because androgen levels are only modestly elevated and unreliable due to their variation throughout the day and throughout the menstrual cycle. However, the effect of excessive androgens is obvious in the masculinizing features of these women (acne, male pattern baldness, facial hair growth), but measuring these androgens is not as useful for the diagnosis of PCOS as you may have thought.By the 1980s, the increasing availability of real-time ultrasound revolutionized the diagnosis of PCOS. Laparotomy was no longer necessary to confirm the enlargement of the ovaries. In 1981, Swanson standardized the definition of polycystic ovaries on ultrasound allowing researchers to easily compare cases. Further refinements included the introduction of trans-vaginal ultrasound which is far superior for detection of ovarian cysts. This technology soon made clear that many otherwise normal women also had multiple cysts on their ovaries. Almost \u00bc of the population had polycystic ovaries without any other symptoms. Thus, it is important to distinguish between the mere presence of polycystic ovaries, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).The 1980s also saw a revolution in our understanding of the underlying cause of PCOS. The disease had originally been thought to be caused by excessive exposure of female fetuses to androgens, but this hypothesis was ultimately refuted. Instead, studies increasingly linked PCOS with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. The prefix \u2018hyper\u2019 means \u2018too much\u2019, and the suffix \u2018-emia\u2019 means \u2018in the blood\u2019, so the word \u2018hyperinsulinemia\u2019 literally means \u2018too much insulin in the blood\u2019.The syndrome was still known by a multitude of different names \u2014 polycystic ovaries disorder, a syndrome of polycystic ovaries, functional ovary androgenism, hyperandrogenic, chronic anovulation, polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian dysmetabolic syndrome, sclerotic polycystic ovary syndrome and so forth. This significantly hampered scientific progress as researchers did not always know whether they were talking about the same disease.Standardization of the terms was necessary to move forward in proper identification and diagnosis. The first step was taken at the 1990 National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Conference on PCOS. At that conference, the consensus criteria included specifically:Because these symptoms are not specific to PCOS, other diseases would need to be ruled out. This so-called NIH criteria was a giant leap forward. Proper classification allowed international collaboration between universities and researchers. Interestingly, the NIH criteria does not require evidence of polycystic ovaries, obviously a problem for a disease known as polycystic ovary syndrome.In 2003, the second international conference on PCOS was held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Two innovative features were added to the consensus criteria becoming now known as the Rotterdam criteria. First, it corrected the seemingly obvious oversight of mentioning that Polycystic Ovary Syndrome patients actually might have polycystic ovaries. It took a mere 14 years to correct that little oversight.Secondly, PCOS was recognized to represent a spectrum of disease and that not all symptoms may appear in all patients. Thus, only two of three criteria were needed to classify patients as PCOS. This includes:In 2006, a further refinement to the criteria was made by the Androgen Excess Society (AES) who recommended that hyperandrogenism be considered the clinical and biochemical hallmark of PCOS. This would be the sine qua nonof PCOS. Without evidence of hyperandrogenism, you simply cannot make the diagnosis. This refinement focused researchers and doctors on the underlying causeof disease, rather than merely the presence or absence of polycystic ovaries. The Rotterdam criteria considered all three of the main elements equal.The NIH criteria, being somewhat older, are rarely used today. In 2012, an NIH Expert Panel recommended that the Rotterdam criteria be used for diagnosis. The AES 2006 recommendations are commonly used as well, being fairly similar to the Rotterdam criteria.It is important to note here that although obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are commonly found in association with PCOS, they are not part of the diagnostic criteria.Written byWritten by","8080":"By Josiah HesseIt\u2019s a blistering hot morning in downtown Denver, and I\u2019m running as fast as I can. Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cJump Into the Fire\u201d is playing at full volume on my headphones as I dodge traffic, turn\u2026","8117":"Many of us have seen commercials for probiotics: pills containing live bacteria that are said to somehow magically improve our digestive system and make us healthier. There\u2019s never any real explanation of why eating live bacteria is good for us \u2014 the commercials just assure us that we should go out and buy their product right now, please and thank you.In fact, there\u2019s a reason why those claims are so vague: The FDA has very strict rules preventing companies from claiming that a product has specific health benefits. If a probiotic company claims that their product \u201ccures IBS,\u201d for example, the FDA will demand that they produce evidence through clinical trials. If a company makes no specific health claims, however, they can include a disclaimer and avoid FDA criticism.Since my degree in genetics focuses on probiotics and microbiomes, I\u2019m often asked for advice on products currently on the market. Is one company\u2019s probiotic better than another\u2019s? Are generic and name-brand microbiomes the same? What\u2019s the best probiotic to take?This question always makes me chuckle, because I have an answer to it. This answer is technically correct, but the recipient will never be happy to hear it.There\u2019s an old joke about converting people to cannibalism, where a persuasive trickster turns to his flock and says, \u201cWhat if I told you that there\u2019s a single food that contains every component that a human needs to live?\u201d He\u2019s speaking, of course, about human flesh. And so, maybe it\u2019s not so surprising that there is a probiotic that contains every microbe found in the digestive tract of a healthy person:The best probiotic you can consume is a pill full of poop.It sounds ridiculous, doesn\u2019t it? But here are some facts worth considering:Given these facts, maybe popping a pill full of poop isn\u2019t such a crazy idea after all!The idea of a fecal transplant has been around for a long time. It dates all the way back to fourth-century China, when products derived from feces were used to treat severe cases of diarrhea or food poisoning. The idea was also used by the Bedouins and other groups in medieval Europe.After the discovery of antibiotics such as penicillin, however, the idea of giving someone more microbes \u2014 the very things that cause disease \u2014 became abhorrent. In 1957, a microbiologist, Stanley Falkow, was fired from his hospital position for attempting to reduce diarrhea and indigestion by suggesting that patients swallow capsules containing their own feces. The idea of transplanting microbes never gained much traction with the medical community. This doesn\u2019t mean, however, that everyone forgot about the idea of eating poop for health benefits. It\u2019s just that fecal transplants moved into the realm of holistic medicine.Think of fecal transplants and probiotics as tackling the same problem, but from opposite sides.Eventually, however, they made a triumphant return, fueled by patients\u2019 desperate search for effective treatments. Intestinal diseases, after all, are very difficult to fight. They\u2019re often secondary infections \u2014 that is, they set in after a person\u2019s system is already weakened. One particularly nasty bacterium, Clostridium difficile (commonly called C. diff), is known for preying on vulnerable hospital patients as they recover from surgery or other treatment. Such intestinal diseases are chronic, causing successive bouts of diarrhea and sickness, and can have a mortality rate as high as 30% among children and the elderly, who can lack the necessary resilience and strength to combat them.Even for otherwise healthy adults, these illnesses can feel like a permanent curse. So it\u2019s not surprising that some desperate patients might seek out alternative treatments on the internet. And that\u2019s exactly how some people discovered the seemingly crazy idea of taking a fecal sample from someone healthy, turning it into a slurry, and inserting it into the rectum.Wacky internet health advice is nothing new \u2014 but in this case, the treatment actually worked. Eventually, when skeptical doctors started trying fecal transplants in a clinical setting for curing C. difficile, they saw a success rate of 94% from a single dose. That kind of cure rate is unheard of.Right now, fecal transplants can only be prescribed for a single disease \u2014 C. difficile infections. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that fecal transplants will stay locked behind pharmacists\u2019 counters for long. Companies are working on developing synthetic microbial communities, trying to isolate the strains of bacteria that serve as keystone species to make a gut microbiome do its job in a healthy individual. Fecal transplants are now being tested for conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). One study showed improvement of IBS symptoms in 49% of patients who consumed \u201cpoop pills,\u201d versus improvement in only 29% of patients who consumed a placebo.As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, the FDA blocks any company from advertising that its products treat a specific disease without clear and unarguable evidence. That restriction is why fecal transplants, especially in pill form, aren\u2019t being widely advertised like probiotics.Think of fecal transplants and probiotics as tackling the same problem, but from opposite sides. Probiotics are trying to add a couple individual strains of bacteria to promote general health effects. Fecal transplants are inserting an entire bacterial ecosystem, hoping to cure a specific disease. Probiotics are marketed directly to consumers, while fecal transplants are only prescribed by specialists, usually MDs.Will we someday see advertising for \u201cmicrobiome-transplant-in-a-pill\u201d touted on television and the internet, promoted by celebrities like Oprah and Dr. Oz, and shared in viral posts by Instagram influencers? That day may be closer than you\u2019d guess. In the meantime, there\u2019s a lot more we need to understand about the workings of the complex, interdependent environment of the gut microbiome. So for now, it\u2019s probably not a good idea to seriously entertain the thought of popping a poop pill into your mouth to start each day.But perhaps, someday soon, we\u2019ll consume the most effective probiotics we\u2019ve discovered \u2014 bacterial communities derived from our very own intestinal tract.Turning poop into gold, indeed.Get the latest Sharing Science articles in your inbox when they're published - the latest on microbiome, biology, and Silicon Valley biotech.\u00a0Take a lookWritten byWritten by","8207":"Looking back over the last 40 years, it\u2019s hard to understand how we could have been so gullible. We believed that fat, and more specifically saturated fat (found primarily in animal foods), was thought to increase cholesterol and cause heart disease. Instead, we should switch to \u2018heart healthy\u2019 vegetable oils, like cottonseed, corn, safflower and soy oils. But recent evidence suggests this was a Faustian bargain. The industrially processed seed oils were much, much worse. It was all a terrible mistake that began with Crisco.Cotton plantations for fabric were cultivated in the United States as early as 1736. Prior to this, it was largely an ornamental plant. At first, most cotton was home-spun into garments, but the success of the crop meant that some could be exported to England. From a modest 600 pounds of cotton in 1784, it grew to over 200,000 by 1790. The invention of the cotton-gin by Eli Whitney in 1793 led to a staggering 40,000,000 pounds of cotton production.But cotton is actually two crops \u2014 the fiber and the seed. For every 100 pounds of fiber, there was 162 pounds of cotton seeds which were largely useless. Only 5% of this seed was required for planting. Some could be used for livestock feed but there was still a mountain of garbage. What could be done with this garbage? Mostly it was left to rot or simply dumped illegally into rivers. It was toxic waste.Meanwhile, in the 1820\u2019s and 1830\u2019s increased demand for oil used in cooking and lighting from a rising population and decreased supply of whale oil meant that prices rose steeply. Enterprising entrepreneurs tried to crush the worthless cotton seeds to extract the oil, but it was not until the 1850s that the technology matured to the point that commercial production could commence. But in 1859, something happened that would transform the modern world. Colonel Drake struck oil in Pennsylvania in 1859 introducing a massive supply of fossil fuels to the modern world. Before long, the demand for cottonseed oil for lighting had completely evaporated and cottonseeds went back to being classified as toxic waste.With lots of cottonseed oil, but no demand, it was added illicitly to animal fats and lards. There was no evidence that this was, in any way safe for human consumption. We don\u2019t eat our cotton T-shirts after all. Similarly, cottonseed oil, being light in flavor and slightly yellow was blended with olive oil to reduce costs. This led to Italy completely banning the adulterated American olive oil in 1883. The Proctor & Gamble company used cottonseed oil for the manufacture of candles and soap, but soon discovered that they could use a chemical process to partially hydrogenate cottonseed oil into a solid fat that resembled lard. This process produced what are now called \u2018Trans\u2019 fats, making this product extremely versatile in the kitchen, even if nobody actually knew whether we should be shoving this former toxic waste into our mouths.It made pastry flakier. It could be used for frying. It could be used in baking. Was it healthy? Nobody knew. Since this new-fangled semi-solid fat resembled food, and the decision was made to market this as food. They called this revolutionary new product Crisco, which stood for crystallized cottonseed oil.Crisco was skillfully marketed as a cheaper alternative to lard. In 1911, Proctor & Gamble launched a brilliant campaign to put Crisco into every American household. They produced a recipe book, all of which use Crisco, of course, and gave it away for free. This was unheard of, at the time. Advertisements of that era also proclaimed that Crisco was easier to digest, cheaper and healthier due to its plant origins. That cottonseeds were essentially garbage was not mentioned. Over the next 3 decades, Crisco and other cottonseed oils dominated the kitchens of America, displacing lard.By the 1950s, cottonseed oil itself was getting expensive and Crisco once again turned to a cheaper alternative, soybean oil. The soybean itself took an improbable route to the American kitchen. Originally from Asia, soybeans were introduced to North America in 1765, having been domesticated in China as far back as 7000 BC. Soybeans are approximately 18% oil and 38% protein, making it ideal as food for livestock or for industrial purposes (paint, engine lubricants).Since Americans ate almost no tofu prior to World War II, little or no soybeans made it into the American diet. Things began to change during the Great Depression, when large areas of the United States were stricken by severe drought \u2014 the Dust Bowl. Soybeans could help regenerate the soil through their ability to fix nitrogen. It turns out that the great American Plains were ideal for growing soybeans, so they quickly became the second most lucrative crop, just behind corn.Meanwhile, in 1924, the American Heart Association was formed. It was not the powerful behemoth it is today, but just a collection of heart specialists meeting occasionally to discuss professional matters. In 1948, this sleepy group of cardiologists were transformed by a $1.5 million donation from Proctor & Gamble, (maker of hydrogenated trans-fat laden Crisco \u2014 yay). The war to replace animal fats with vegetable oils was on. The Faustian deal was made \u2014 the health of a nation for some filthy lucre $$$.By the 1960s and 1970s, led by Ancel Keys, the new dietary villain was saturated fats, the type found in more frequently in animal foods like meat and dairy. The American Heart Association (AHA) wrote the world\u2019s first official recommendations in 1961 recommending that we \u201creduce intake of total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. Increase intake of polyunsaturated fat\u201d. In other word, avoid animal fat and eat \u2018heart-healthy\u2019 vegetable oils, high in polyunsaturated fats, like Crisco. This advice carried forward to the influential 1977 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.The American Heart Association threw its now considerable market-moving influence into making sure that America ate less fat, and less saturated fat. The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), for example, declared the switch from beef tallow and other saturated fats to trans-fat laden partially hydrogenated oils as \u201ca great boon to Americans\u2019 arteries\u2019. Don\u2019t eat butter, they said. Instead, replace it with the partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (read: trans-fats) known as margarine. That edible tub of plastic was much healthier than the butter that humans had been consuming for at least 3000 years, they said. Even as late as 1990 the CPSI refused to acknowledge the dangers of trans fats writing, famously their bottom line \u2014 \u201cTrans, shmans. You should eat less fat\u201d.In 1994, the CSPI struck fear into movie-goers hearts with a brilliant scare campaign. Movie popcorn at that time popped in coconut oil, which was largely saturated fats. The CSPI declared that a medium sized bag of movie popcorn had more \u2018artery clogging fat than a bacon-and eggs breakfast, a Big Mac and fries for lunch, and a steak dinner with all the trimmings \u2014 combined!\u201d Movie popcorn sales plunged, and theatres raced to replace their coconut oil with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. Yes, trans-fats. Before that, the war to rid the American public of beef tallow, the secret ingredient of McDonald\u2019s French fries, resulted in the switch to, you guessed it, partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.But the story was not yet done. By the 1990s, these trans fats that the AHA and the CSPI told us were supposed to be so healthy for us were implicated as major risk factors for heart disease. New studies now indicated that trans-fats just about doubled the risk of heart disease for every 2% increase in trans-fat calories. By some estimates, trans-fats were responsible for 100,000 deaths. The very \u2018heart-healthy\u2019 foods the AHA recommended we eat were actually giving us heart attacks. The irony. The irony. By November 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration removed partially hydrogenated oils from the list of human foods \u2018Generally Recognized as Safe\u2019. Yes, the AHA had been telling us to eat poison for decades.Industrial seed oils, such as cottonseed are high in the omega-6 fat linoleic acid. Linoleic acid is called the parent omega-6 fat because other omega-6 fats, such as gamma linolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid are formed from it. During evolutionary times, the intake of linoleic acid would have only come from whole foods, such as eggs, nuts and seeds, whereas isolated omega-6 intake from industrial seed oils would have been zero. However, Crisco, introduced an isolated and adulterated type of linoleic acid into our diet. Thus, the intake of linoleic acid has dramatically increased and from a source that humans have never consumed before. These omega-6 seed oils can now be found in nearly all manufactured foods and are also found in grocery aisles in plastic bottles for cooking. Unfortunately, these oils are highly susceptible to heat, light, and air and are exposed to all three during their processing. Thus, while linoleic acid coming from whole foods such as nuts and seeds may actually be beneficial, the adulterated linoleic acid found in industrial seed oils is not.So how do we know which are healthy fats, and which are unhealthy fats? Unsurprisingly, natural fats, whether they come from animal (meat, dairy) or plant sources (olive, avocado, nut) are generally healthy. Highly processed, industrial seed oils tend to be unhealthy. Let\u2019s face the facts \u2014 we ate vegetable oils because they were CHEAP, not because they were healthy.For more information see the fantastic book by Nina Teicholz The Big Fat Surprise.Written byWritten by","8215":"Get me the hell out of here!\u201cTake this,\u201d a nurse instructed as she thrust a small cup of liquid towards me. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, we\u2019ll have to use the tube. Drink it all!\u201dI drank it all. It tasted like a chalkboard, but the thought of any sort of tube near my mouth frightened me. How did I even get to the hospital, anyway?The nurse stood next to my bed and considered me for a moment. \u201cYou could have died,\u201d she said matter of factly.I had no explanation to give her. I remembered bits and pieces of what I\u2019d done the night before, taking pill after pill of my sleeping medication until the bottle was empty, but how I felt about that fact now was harder to process.\u201cWhen will I be discharged?\u201d I asked her, fearing the answer. I wanted nothing more in that moment to be home in bed watching a little TV or sleeping a lot more.\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cAfter you\u2019re done here, they\u2019ll transfer you to a psychiatric hospital. It\u2019s the law for attempted suicide.\u201dWas that a smirk? She seemed to be void of any bedside manner. Of course, she probably dealt with life and death all day long, and the thought of some middle-class suburban chick squandering her life away on purpose must have pissed her off big time.The thought of a mental hospital terrified me. My whole body shook with anxiety, and I stayed that way until the police showed up eight hours later to take me over to the unit. Tears welled in my eyes as the officer produced a pair of handcuffs. He explained that it was protocol. I felt like dirt on the bottom of somebody\u2019s shoe. He approached me and then paused for a second.\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I think we can make an exception. You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re going to cause any trouble.\u201d I would have hugged him if I could.When we reached the front door of the psychiatric unit, I breathed a sigh of relief. If the lobby was any indication, it would be like staying in a nice hotel. The furniture was classy, and there was a giant flat screen on one wall. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad, maybe like a little vacation.At intake, they decided they would put me in the \u201cless dangerous\u201d unit, mostly people like me who made suicide gestures or were suffering from depression. I shuddered to think what the \u201cdangerous unit\u201d would have entailed, and I thanked the staff for their decision.\u201cA little girl like you would get chewed up and spit out,\u201d a male nurse responded as he led me past a locked door and fiddled with his keys. He motioned for me to go through to my home for the next three days.The inside of the unit was stark compared to the lobby. They painted the walls with an ugly green color that gave the rooms a strange hue. There was minimal furniture and decorations as if they didn\u2019t want to make it too comfortable.My very first thought was of the people. They were everywhere, patients and staff yelling at each other across the nurses\u2019 station, people grabbing food off a snack cart while simultaneously crying and shouting. It was a complete sensation overload.I was glad when I was shown to my room where I hoped there would be peace and quiet. When I got there, a nurse ordered me into the bathroom to put on a gown. I had to have an exam to make sure I was healthy and wasn\u2019t carrying contraband. I was too tired to protest. \u201cGet some rest,\u201d she said after it was over. I laid down on my bed covered with the thinnest of sheets. My body quickly hit the off switch, and I settled into an uneven sleep.\u201cWho are you? What are you doing in this room?\u201d I opened my eyes to find a woman leaning over and yelling at me. I scooted up to the edge of the bed to get away from her. She was a young wiry woman wearing a hospital gown much like mine. There was also a nurse in the room who seemed to be arranging the girl\u2019s belongings.\u201cDon\u2019t mind her,\u201d the nurse said kindly. \u201cShe\u2019s manic right now, but her medication will kick in soon.\u201dIt didn\u2019t kick in for at least two hours.I was mentally and physically exhausted. By the time I saw a doctor the next morning, my focus was on getting out of the hospital as soon as possible. Even though I wanted to cry, I took a deep breath and produced a huge smile. I knew I had to look as normal as possible if I had any chance of leaving.\u201cIt was just a big mistake,\u201d I promised the doctor. \u201cI\u2019m fine now. I\u2019d never do anything like that again.\u201dThe doctor smiled back and said that by law I had to stay for 48 hours, but after that he would discharge me. When I saw him again the next day, he remarked at how much better I looked and said it seemed like I was ready to go home. My plan worked! I had him completely snowed.I passed the time at the hospital sitting as close to the nurse\u2019s station as possible, deathly afraid one of the other patients would hurt me. The unit was loud and raucous, and I constantly scanned the people in my mind to predict which one of them would freak out first.At least I\u2019m not like them, I reasoned. Things could be a lot worse. I\u2019m actually pretty lucky.As promised, I was released within 48 hours. My doctor wished me luck and predicted I would do just fine. My first taste of freedom was delicious. The sun shone brightly that morning, and I had my first cigarette in two days in my hand getting ready to light it. The relief I felt couldn\u2019t be measured with existing technology. I never had to go through this again.Until I went through it again.It became a vicious cycle. I\u2019d have a breakdown and be admitted to the psychiatric unit, and then I\u2019d spend the whole time there pretending I was normal so I could be released as fast as possible. It was like being in a holding tank, just sitting on the unit being afraid of the other patients until the staff let me go.I never got better after each visit. The way I acted while there was totally fake, and I never got the care I needed. \u201cI\u2019m not like the others,\u201d I insisted to anyone who would listen. \u201cI don\u2019t belong here.\u201dA few years ago, I finally went to a psychiatrist asking for help, and he diagnosed me with bipolar disorder. Everything made sense after that, the highs and lows and impulsive behavior such as swallowing a bunch of pills when I felt broken inside. The sense of gratitude I felt in knowing the truth was overwhelming.I still think about my experiences in the mental health unit sometimes. I haven\u2019t been back since my diagnosis, and because I\u2019m stable with medication and therapy, I probably won\u2019t go back in all likelihood.I can\u2019t help wondering what would have happened if I\u2019d been honest on my first visit, if I\u2019d told them that something was wrong with me I couldn\u2019t figure out. What if I had reached out and tried to understand the other patients rather than shunning them? What if I\u2019d stayed until I was truly better and not tried so hard to rush everything?I kept saying I wasn\u2019t one of \u201cthem,\u201d but we were more alike than I realized. We were suffering and hurt and shattered. We were the same, yet they were better than me. They were trying to get help, doing what they were told in order to get better instead of constantly trying to escape. They never once doubted they were in the right place.I know now that every one of us is the same, just with different levels of pain in our lives. I may be bipolar, but there\u2019s more that connects me to the rest of the world than separates me. I reach out now when I need help and accept it gratefully. It\u2019s the only way any of us are going to get through this life.Written byWritten by","8240":"Are you crushing it? Do you work on the weekends? Do you live and breathe hustle? Does raw productivity seep from your pores? Are you proud of your regime where you take a weekend morning away from your family and smash your emails? Will you sleep when you\u2019re dead?Performative productivity is a particularly pernicious strain of counterproductive machismo whose main purpose is to demonstrate that you\u2019re at work, rather than to actually get anything done. It\u2019s much more about who\u2019s watching than what you\u2019re working on; we\u2019ve accidentally built a culture that values hollow demonstrations of effort more than actually being productive. It\u2019s an easy metric for short-sighted managers: even if nobody\u2019s officially measuring who\u2019s spending long hours at the office, it\u2019s definitely noticed. And nobody ever got a promotion for slacking off, right?That\u2019s a myth. It turns out that people who do take time off are more likely to get a raise (although whether this is correlation or causation is not completely clear). But because we generally assume that people who take downtime are not as productive, anyone not at the top of their professional hierarchy is trapped into this perverse work theater. It destroys our relationships, it destroys our health, and \u2014 ironically, but not surprisingly \u2014 it stifles our creativity and performance at work. As Harvard Business Review pointed out:One experiment conducted at BCG, for example, found that forcing employees to take days, nights, or extended periods of time off actually increased productivity. And other studies show that brief periods of downtime, like afternoon naps, can restore focus and energy.There\u2019s a whole piece to be written on how psychotic work environments have to be for employees to be forced to take a night off \u2014 but I\u2019ll abstain for now. Still, contrast this attitude with France, where a law went into effect last year that protects employee time by outlawing bosses from emailing them after hours.As one French Member of Parliament put it at the time, problems with work-life balance are exacerbated by technology:\u201cEmployees physically leave the office, but they do not leave their work. They remain attached by a kind of electronic leash \u2014 like a dog. The texts, the messages, the emails \u2014 they colonize the life of the individual to the point where he or she eventually breaks down.\u201dChecking email less often reduces stress. One can easily extrapolate to other kinds of notifications: Slack channels, instant messages, SMS, and so on. It\u2019s all a constant barrage of nagging that doesn\u2019t allow you to ever truly leave the office. In turn, workplace stress adds up to over $190 billion in US employer healthcare costs, as well as time off and real lost productivity. Similar findings led to the French law having broad support among employees and employers alike.This workplace stress also contributes to over 120,000 deaths a year in the US alone. True downtime is biologically necessary, and our current models are nowhere near enough:Corporate America may never sanction working only four hours a day, but research suggests that to maximize productivity we should reform the current model of consecutive 40-hour workweeks separated only by two-day weekends and sometimes interrupted by short vacations. [\u2026] Instead of limiting people to a single week-long vacation each year or a few three-day vacations here and there, companies should also allow their employees to take a day or two off during the workweek and encourage workers to banish all work-related tasks from their evenings.It\u2019s not normal. Eight years into working in America, I\u2019m still getting used to the macho culture around vacations. I had previously lived in a country where 28 days per year is the minimum that employers can legally provide; taking time off is just considered a part of life. The US is one of the only countries in the world that doesn\u2019t guarantee any vacation at all (the others are Tonga, Palau, Nauru, Micronesia, Kiribati, and the Marshall Islands). It\u2019s telling that American workers often respond to this simple fact with disbelief. How does anything get done?! Well, it turns out that a lot gets done when people aren\u2019t burned out or chained to their desks.Because of America\u2019s endemic culture of employment abuse, it\u2019s not enough to intellectually know that people need more downtime during the day, that they should be free to enjoy their lives after work, or that they should have more regular time off. The only way to enforce these kinds of behaviors is to set new cultural norms inside an organization, and create systems of rules to hold people to account. Intention is good, but must be backed up with action.Here are some simple rules, some derived from workplaces in other countries, that could improve American office life.With perhaps the exception of TOIL, I don\u2019t think any of the above rules should be at all controversial. Yet, these ideas seem to be surprisingly rarely implemented, to everybody\u2019s detriment.In a world where we\u2019re working longer hours for more years, it\u2019s time we all helped build a more compassionate working culture. And where that\u2019s not possible organically, it\u2019s perhaps time to consider returning to the ideas that brought us the 40 hour workweek and the weekend to begin with. Worker productivity drives every business, and the economy of every country; workers deserve to live well while doing it. There\u2019s no glory in burning yourself out, and certainly none in allowing someone else to do it to you.Written byWritten by","8275":"According to every other health article you\u2019ve read in the past 10 years, breakfast is supposedly the more important meal of the day. If you aren\u2019t waking up to a healthy spread then you are basically going to die, per other sources.This is usually based on the loose idea that more meals create a faster metabolism and as busy people, we tend to skip meals except for lunch and dinner. The solution was to convince people that they HAD to have breakfast to be healthy.Surprisingly, this really isn\u2019t the case. There actually isn\u2019t really a reason to force feed yourself breakfast, however, there isn\u2019t necessarily anything wrong with having breakfast either! In this article I am going to go over some reasons as to why you don\u2019t have to have breakfast, but also ways to have a better breakfast if you decide to go that route.First scenario:Let\u2019s say you wake up at 6 A.M. to start getting ready for work. You get up, shower, clean yourself, and what\u2019s next before leaving? \u201cOh sh*t I need to eat breakfast!\u201d At this point you probably realize that you aren\u2019t even hungry, so you just grab something to take with you. That something is one of those unhealthy \u201ccereal\u201d bars full of sugar. Or you stop at the Starbucks and grab a sugary pastry on your way in. Are you really doing the whole breakfast thing any justice here? Really all you\u2019re doing is spiking your insulin, just to have a sugar crash about 30 minutes into being at work.Second Scenario:You get up bright and early because it\u2019s a new year, new you. One of your resolutions is to start eating breakfast more because Doctor Oz said it will make you immortal. You actually hate breakfast food, because you\u2019re never hungry that early in the morning and you basically force feed yourself trying not to barf. However, you get up anyways and scarf down this massive breakfast of eggs, bacon, orange juice, a bagel, and a small bowl of cereal. That\u2019s a lot of food, and you actually end up feeling stuffed and more tired than you were when you woke up.So, in both of these situations, breakfast did not make either person feel better or healthier. It actually gave them the opposite effect. Now this is due to the fact that most \u201cbreakfast\u201d foods are centered around being very high in carbs and sugar. This was really just a marketing scheme that has plagued us over the years to increase the belief that you had to consume certain foods for breakfast.In reality if both of these people had skipped breakfast altogether and just waited till they were actually hungry (usually around lunch), they would\u2019ve been perfectly fine. Their energy levels would\u2019ve stayed normal and maybe even been higher than normal. They could\u2019ve coasted through their morning not tired or bloated and been comfortable when lunch time came.What they could\u2019ve done instead of eating breakfast is create a more efficient morning centered around replacing what\u2019s missing (which isn\u2019t always food). Some things that need to be addressed upon waking are dehydration, circadian rhythm, and breathing.While you sleep, you may sometimes sweat if the room is too hot and you also expel a lot of moisture from breathing. You also haven\u2019t had food or water for close to 6\u20138 hours, so none of what you\u2019re losing is getting put back in. Water is obviously more important than food, so it can wait. Anyways, this puts you in a water deficit and you need to focus on fixing it. So, upon waking, go to the kitchen and drink a 8\u201310 oz glass of water, lemon juice, and himalayan salt. The salt and lemon juice help to add some electrolytes to the water and get your innards moving. Try this before you even have coffee and you\u2019ll feel great before you even need the caffeine kick!As far as circadian rhythm, we need light exposure to wake up naturally. We need to sleep in darkness, and somehow get some light to switch our body out of that sleep state. So, instead of toast go outside in the morning and move around in the sun. You will almost feel your body realizing that it\u2019s time to wake up and get moving.While sleeping we do a low and slow breathing pattern. This doesn\u2019t really pull in a lot of oxygen because we don\u2019t necessarily need it at that resting state. However, once awake we need to get the blood and brain oxygenated. This can be done by taking the time to focus on some really deep breathes, some fast, some slow. Pair these breathing methods with a cold shower and you won\u2019t even need coffee to wake up.Most people think that not having breakfast is going to slow down your metabolism. Well, it can if you don\u2019t eat for a VERY long time. Long term fasting can lead to a slowing of metabolism, but 12 or so hours won\u2019t harm you. If anything it will help rid your body of the waste that\u2019s still left over from yesterday! This gives your body a little break before putting it back to work on digestion.If you\u2019re someone who is actively trying to not eat breakfast, but you\u2019re starving, then you have two options. You could just eat something, or you could have something like a healthier coffee that will stave off your hunger for a while. I talk about some coffee ideas in my recent article How To Create Super Nutritional Coffee that could be helpful here.You may be someone who can\u2019t live without breakfast. Let\u2019s be honest there are some great options for breakfast that are hard to pass up. It may even just be part of your routine and helps you get your day started. Well, if that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019m going to give you some ways to optimize it.So when you think of something healthy, usually what comes to mind is some sort of fruit or veggie. Well, that\u2019s because they are healthy. If you\u2019re going to be consuming breakfast just make sure it isn\u2019t junk. Create a healthy spread with some fruit and veggies incorporated. This can usually be accomplished quick and easy with a protein smoothie. Just keep the ratio of veggie to fruit around 3:1 so you don\u2019t get to big of an insulin spike.Pretty much the main reason the scenarios at the beginning were so negative, was because they dumped a bunch of sugar into their body. It is a well known fact that sugar spikes insulin, which can make you crash. People have always put the blame for Thanksgiving naps on turkey because of the tryptophan, but it is usually due to a massive spike in insulin (fun fact!). So to create a better breakfast, just watch the carbs and keep it high fat\/high protein. A good example would be just some classic bacon and eggs. You\u2019ll be full until lunch without cravings due to the fact that fats and proteins increase satiety!The high fat content first thing in the morning is also good for your brain. If you normally consume some sugar laden cereal, you may have noticed a phenomenon called \u201cbrain fog\u201d. You literally feel like there is fog around your brain. However, with a high fat\/high protein breakfast in your belly, you\u2019ll be focused and actually be able to think straight.There you have it. A reason that you CAN skip breakfast in the mornings without dying! It\u2019s easy to believe everything you read (hopefully you believe me), just do some of your own research. There are plenty of reliable sources that provide good information. Just do what works for you, whether that be eating (hopefully better now) breakfast, or skipping it and waiting until lunch. Either option may suit you, just make sure to do it the right way!Lost when it comes to nutrition and health? Let me help you out!

We\u2019re not sleeping enough and too busy, so what better way to pry us out of a cold lifeless state other than a nice cup of joe. Coffee is a drink that is made by roasted coffee beans and then grinding them into a powder like substance. Normally hot water is poured over these ground up beans and out comes the delicious nectar that we call coffee. Coffee is made in a thousand different ways, I mean listen to the people at Starbucks order their mocha latte with soy milk and half a pack of Splenda and two sugars, but with only a half-inch of foam. It can get pretty specific.There are also thousand of different flavors and roasting processes. Coffee is ever-changing and evolving, while also staying true to itself as a staple beverage.Okay, now that the background info has been laid out, here is the purpose of this article. Coffee alone doesn\u2019t provide a lot of nutritional value besides its caffeine content. People add lots of sugar and milk to theirs to increase the flavor, but nutritionally that\u2019s not helping anyone. So we\u2019re going to discuss some ways to make your coffee more nutritious and even enhance the effects that it provides.Yes, add some fats, you read that right. There are many who add a little bit of fat with their milk or cream, but I\u2019m talking about real fats. Two of the main ones I\u2019ll mention are butter (preferably grass-fed) and coconut oil (or MCT oils). These are both saturated fats, which receive quite the bad rep. However, they are actually beneficial when consumed in normal amounts (too much of anything is bad).Butter in coffee may sound disgusting, but if you get the no salt added kind it\u2019s not that bad. I was skeptical at first, but began to actually enjoy the added flavor, especially when frothed. The point of the grass-fed butter is to include essential fatty acids that aren\u2019t present in all butters or margarine. This fatty acid is called an omega-3 fatty acid. There are two different omega fatty acids ( 3&6). We consume way too much omega-6 in the forms of vegetable oil or canola oil, and we need to work towards fixing that ratio. Grass-fed butter is one thing that contains these fatty acids.Coconut oil or MCT oil is obtained from the meat of a coconut. It is a saturated fat, but it\u2019s chemical makeup actually makes it very healthy. Since it is a saturated fat, people believed that it would increase your bad cholesterol. However, coconut oil tends to increase your good cholesterol (HDL). This is because half of the saturated fat is considered \u201clauric acid\u201d, which aids in production of HDL. Since it is from a fruit, it also contains many antioxidants and other compounds that improve health markers.The extra benefits of adding these fats also comes in the form of satiety. This means keeping your appetite at bay when trying to cut back on cravings and calories. If you don\u2019t believe me just try it with your morning coffee instead of jumping right into breakfast.The reason it suppresses appetite is because fats take longer to digest than proteins and carbs, so your body will be preoccupied breaking down fats to feel hungry.Collagen is a supplement that has grown recently on the market. Mainly because it has many benefits on many different things. It is made from various amino acids and proteins that make up connective tissue. Usually this is derived from animal connective tissue such as cows and chickens and even fish. This usually comes in the form of a powder and is great for joints, skin, hair, gut, and nails. It is an all around healing food that is good for your entire body inside and out.Being a powder, and usually flavorless, it can easily be added to your coffee in the mornings. This takes a normal cup of coffee and makes it a super nutritious snack to have in the mornings. It\u2019s high in protein so it will help stave off hunger cravings, while also nourishing your body inside and out. One that mixes very well is Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides. This brand of collagen is flavorless and mixes to a point that you don\u2019t even know it\u2019s in your coffee.Majority of people just don\u2019t like a nice cup of black coffee. So they need to add a bunch of sugar and syrups to get the flavors they want. Let\u2019s be honest, most people enjoy their coffee more like a dessert. It\u2019s common knowledge that this is not nutritious in the slightest and you would be better off just drinking the plain cup of joe.A solution to this would be to find a protein powder that you actually like and add it to your coffee. You could really customize this to fit your preference of flavor. For example you could buy some Dymatize Natural Vanilla Protein and add a scoop to your coffee. If you throw it in the blender for a second or two, it\u2019ll create some foam and you\u2019ll have a vanilla latte without the regret. So instead of a plain cup of coffee or one full of sugar, you now have a high protein beverage that tastes like dessert. You could play around with recipes like this and create whatever fun coffee concoctions you\u2019d like, all by just getting some protein powder.So this next addition is going to sound a little weird. You can add mushrooms to your coffee to increase the nutritional value, and the already existent effects of the coffee.Recently, different supplements featuring mushrooms have been on the rise in popularity, however these aren\u2019t the ones that make the wall melt. These are various mushrooms that fall in a category called adaptogens. Basically they are homeopathic ways to enhances various systems in the body. Examples of these mushrooms are reishi, lion\u2019s mane, and shitake. Each one of these provides various benefits, but what these companies have began to do is make different supplements with them. One of which is mushroom coffee mix!Four Sigmatic Mushroom Coffee is the brand that is paving the way for mushrooms as a beverage. Their mixes are an instant coffee that you just mix with hot water (they also sell a variety of other products). However, I mix the packet with an already made cup of coffee and let me tell you, it packs a punch! The mushroom coffee has a nootropic effect, which basically means that it enhances your focus and mental acuity. Coffee is itself a nootropic, but combined with the mushrooms, it\u2019s a force to be reckoned with if you\u2019re needing to focus or be productive.Some of the mushrooms they use provide other nutritional benefits such as antioxidants and other properties that help the body from the inside and out.There are many ways to spruce up your morning coffee. Whether you choose to add some fats, collagen, protein, or mushrooms; it is still going to be more nutritious than a plain cup of black coffee. You can experiment with different combos or just say to heck with it and mix it all together for one mega cup of coffee. I\u2019m sure it would taste great and you\u2019d be seeing sounds after having drank it!Originally published at cntsystems.net on August 17, 2018.Written byWritten by","8380":"Bipolar has transformed my life into a monumental challenge, and I feel guilty when it affects my family and friends.Smiling, interacting, being part of the family unit or social circle\u2026 all can be exhausting. Between my medications and pushing through the day, I sometimes slip into a landslide of lassitude. Naps are not only a nicety, but a necessity\u2026or neither. Sometimes I want to withdraw to my bed to escape life for time being. Unable to face certain tasks, I avoid it all by letting my bed and sleep comfort me.The want to participate in various activities often vanishes. A list of necessary tasks runs through my head, yet I cannot push through the barricade of depression to attempt them. Invitations from friends are declined because there are times when the effort to interact is too taxing. Simply stated, the smallest events can feel like colossal undertakings.I want to be a good mother, to keep up with my son\u2019s academic, home, and social life. I have good intentions, but they sometimes only last a day or two before I simply cross my fingers and hope for the best. I\u2019ve allowed my son to self-entertain more than a parent should. I lack the needed energy to debate with him why he should read a book or go ride his bike or find constructive activities in lieu of playing video games. As a result, I\u2019ve witnessed his curiosity and diverse activities diminish over the years.My husband and son have been the targets of the irrational irritability I sometimes experience. If my fuse is too short one day, I may lash out. The smallest inconvenience could set me off. The irritability is often combined with anxiety, and I have to render myself a timeout by leaving the room. Once alone, I may yell or cry in frustration. I don\u2019t want to hurt the ones I love. I don\u2019t want to have this unreasonable irritability and anger.My bipolar is being managed through medication and therapy, but there is no cure. Relapses happen (aka sh*t happens). I\u2019d love to shake it off\u2026jump up and down, flail my arms, shake my head, and dance it out. It often doesn\u2019t work, but the adrenaline rush temporarily feels good\u2026and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m a sight to be seen.Copyright \u00a9 2018 Alicia T-Rust.

Instead, I hope you will see that anyone can achieve a healthy lifestyle by taking small steps, day by day. Yes, you can. I\u2019m sharing my story in hopes to inspire others who want to be healthier and fit but need a little motivation and hope.I wasn\u2019t always unhealthy. From my late teens to my early twenties, I was very fit. But, I had sustained an injury that was never treated, and it only caused deeper issues in my body and, eventually, chronic pain. As a result, by my mid-twenties, I had to stop going to the gym, running, everything. And, I started gaining weight.And, I was shameless. During those years around New Year\u2019s, when people would start talking about resolutions, I used to half-joke, and say that mine was simple: Get fatter than last year! It stopped being funny when it actually happened. Eventually, I topped out at 205 pounds. I was fat.Not only was I overweight, I was very unhealthy. I didn\u2019t exercise. I ate poorly. And, worse yet, I didn\u2019t care. As I pause and wonder why I didn\u2019t, I think it was because I was going through an extremely difficult season of life. I struggled with over a decade of chronic pain, and it was wearing on me. And, I was directionless in my life. I got fired from the only job I was qualified for, and I felt lost.After reading a biography on Abraham Lincoln and Cornelius Vanderbilt and learning that both of them ate very little, I was inspired to cut fifty percent of my diet. So, whatever I would usually eat I cut that meal in half. Four tacos went to two. A whole sandwich went to a half. You get how that works.At first, I was hungry all of the time. You know that kind of hunger that causes you to start looking at that leftover slice of pizza in the trashcan as a possible meal. That was me. After a few months of that, I lost about thirty pounds.I weighed less and was no longer obese. But, I still wasn\u2019t very healthy, and I still felt terrible. I hadn\u2019t done any cardiovascular work or strength training. I didn\u2019t want to do the work. I still didn\u2019t care that much about my health to go through the pain of working out and breaking bad habits. And, my chronic pain didn\u2019t get any better, but I started to get the feeling that I needed to do some kind of exercise to improve.And, I thought a stronger core could alleviate my pain. The pain was always there and was unbearable some days. After going to at least a dozen doctors, they all said I was fine. I wasn\u2019t. I had to do something, anything to help myself. So I started to do some core exercises. Calling it exercise is being generous: I just did a crunch or two, maybe three on the days I felt like it. That might have been two to three times a week.Around the time I started my fifty percent diet, I met my wife for the first time, and we started dating. After nine months, we got married. And, she was very active (and still is). She would work out at a gym most days, and she got a membership for me, hoping I\u2019d join her. I didn\u2019t. And, I gradually stopped my fifty percent diet and started eating more.Then my whole perspective on health changed. My son was born. Instead of not caring that much, I was compelled to care. There was another human that needed me to be around. My father died when I was young because he didn\u2019t live a healthy lifestyle. So, I resolved to do everything in my power not to let that happen to my son.Before our son was born, my wife would walk almost every day, and she would often invite me. But, I always said no. And after he was born, she started walking again. It was winter in St. Louis, and they can be brutally cold. So, she was going to the nearby mall to walk. Then, one day she asked me to join her after she gave birth, and I said yes. She was shocked. We had our baby in the stroller as we walked. It was us and the sixty and seventy-year-olds going around and around. That day we became a mall walking family. But, it wasn\u2019t that simple.When I was walking, I got winded, even lightheaded. You know, that feeling you get when you exert yourself a lot or run up some stairs too fast. Yeah, well, I got that feeling when I was walking at the mall, in a climate controlled, even grounded, 80\u2019s music playing mall. Even worse, my calves were sore afterward. I was that soft and was tempted to quit. But, I didn\u2019t and continued to walk with my family every day. Eventually, it got easier and even fun. I became a proud mall walker.After a few months of that, I decided to challenge myself to run. Early on, my entire body felt like it was on fire even though I had barely run a mile. After six months of running two to three times a week, it was still painful for me (mostly because of my chronic pain), but running got easier. One mile increased to six, and I went from running a ten-plus minute mile to a sub-eight minute mile.Then I learned about intermittent fasting (IF) from a podcast. IF is basically not eating or consuming any calories for an extended amount of time (like twelve to sixteen hours) on a regular or semi-regular basis. On the Tim Ferriss show, he was interviewing this 80-year-old, Dr. Arthur De Vany, talking about how to reverse aging. I thought, \u201cReverse aging sounds good.\u201d So, I listened. I\u2019d never heard of De Vany or seen him (I googled him up afterward, and he\u2019s very fit, especially for an octogenarian). He talked about the benefits of fasting and how it helps the body stay stronger, fitter and slows the aging process.The idea of fasting on an ongoing basis scared me. I come from an immigrant family, and my mother, as a child, lived through war and famine. And she fed us three square meals a day, every day of my life until we left home. So, I saw eating when I was hungry as a necessity. But, if fasting was going to help me get healthier, I was going to try it. So, I started fasting every day except from Saturday afternoons until Sunday after dinner. IF improved the way I felt, and I got even more fit.I marvel at the fact that I was even able to live a healthier lifestyle. Here are some reflections from my process.I couldn\u2019t change my body and health until my mind changed. Before I started this journey, I didn\u2019t care that much about health. I was actually hurting myself by getting fatter. Then, after my son was born, my thinking changed. My mind had to get into a healthier place before I was ready to make my body better. I had to make a decision to get fit. And, that started a virtuous cycle, because my mind got stronger and healthier as my body did from the exercise and eating good, clean food.It was an incremental process. I took one step at a time. I went from a few crunches a day when I felt like it to doing multiple sets every day over nine years. Getting fit has been a marathon, not a sprint. And I had to be patient with myself. I couldn\u2019t rush the process, but I also pushed myself to progress. My process and workouts may not fit everyone, but it is a process to get fit. And, the one thing you can\u2019t do is quit. Don\u2019t stop. Keep going. It can evolve, slow down, change; but don\u2019t quit. Making the initial decision to get healthy is never enough, you have to keep making it.For me, getting fit required me doing things I really hate until I didn\u2019t hate them as much. Running just hurts me. I don\u2019t mean that I have an injury or that I\u2019m getting injured when I run. It\u2019s just the pain of moving my body vigorously for thirty-five minutes when I\u2019d rather be inside lying in bed reading a book. Fasting isn\u2019t fun either. I love to eat whenever I want. But, the truth is after I run and fast, I feel great. And, now, they are habits. And just because it\u2019s a habit doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to quit. I have a twinge of temptation to eat breakfast or not work out almost every day. I just went for a run this morning, and still, I had to fight myself to get out there because I\u2019d prefer to stay in bed. But, I go. I run. And, I feel great.I attribute a lot of my success in this to God giving me a wife who is active and loves routine. If she didn\u2019t force me to start walking and encouraging me, I would have never kept up with my regimen. And, she\u2019s incredibly regimented, which helped me do the same. When I don\u2019t feel like running, I know that my wife is doing her exercises that day without fail. So, I do mine. We don\u2019t work out together, but having someone help enforce the practice is critical to maintaining the momentum of getting healthy and staying fit.You, too, can get healthy, even in your forties, even with chronic pain. You don\u2019t need a gym membership, all you need is a mat, a little motivation. It starts with making the decision to get fit. I didn\u2019t start big. I started small. With a crunch or two when I felt like it. Before I was a runner, I was a mall walker. If you are patient with yourself, and gradually change your habits, you can be fit. You may get winded by walking in the mall, but don\u2019t let that stop you. It just takes a little bit of work to get better and better.I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m reversing aging, but I do feel great.You can, too.Originally published at johnpa.com on August 11, 2018.Written byWritten by","8419":"I can vividly remember the first time I was asked this question.As I was trekking to Everest Base camp in Nepal at the time. Basking by the glow of a blazing fire in a cozy tea house while a blizzard raged outside. Surrounded by great company which consisted of trekkers from all parts of the world and local Sherpas. It was difficult not to feel an intense form of bliss. I surveyed the scene and thought how lucky am I to be playing cards on a side of a mountain in one of the most picturesque places on earth.My moment of bliss was interrupted by the words of a gentleman who had been observing me. He hailed from the Netherlands and was part of our group who were playing cards.\u2018Why are you so happy?\u2019 he asked quizzically, while continuing \u2018 you have the perfect look of contentment on your face\u2019.He said this in a way that suggested such contentment eluded him. I was surprised by the question. I pondered from a moment. Then I thought about where in the world I was, what it had taken to get here and I replied\u2018How can I not be happy?\u2019 \u2018Just look at where we are!\u2019We succumbed to the relaxed atmosphere of the house once again. Raucous laughter filled the air, genuine smiles lit up the faces of those around me. No TV meant that people conversed, played and formed genuine connections. It was comforting to witness.This was not to be an isolated incident. I found that as I continued to travel I was repeatedly asked this question.In Tasmania, during a dinner with some friends I was introduced to a distant relative of the Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw. His name is Sandy Shaw. Hailing from Ireland and with a deep love of literature I found this tremendously exciting. After christening me as \u2018Tinklebell\u2019 due to my constant laughter over dinner Sandy asked \u2018Why are you so happy?\u2019 with that familiar quizzical look.This question continues to plague me as I traverse Australia.Recently I acquired a job in hospitality where I work in a number of areas including reception and the restaurant. I have been bewildered by the sheer number of observations made regarding my happiness, smile and Irishness.Does this suggest that most people are not genuinely happy? I don\u2019t believe I am some bizarre specimen that exists in isolation. I will admit that it has been a struggle to get to this point and takes work to remain authentically happy. Of course, I am not always happy. This would be impossible. I have days where I get fed up, feel disheartened and want nothing more than to retreat to the safe haven underneath my blankets. However, I find that I can now jolt myself out of these states quite quickly and resume being a happy human.Being asked \u2018Why am I so happy\u2019 throughout my travels has prompted me to try and figure out what actions I took to become a happier human.Action 01: Practicing gratitude on a regular basisI became more grateful after I began to practice yoga on a regular basis.The act of consciously breathing deeply helped me to become a calmer being. I began to practice it during my everyday life. If I started to feel stressed or overwhelmed I would pause and focus on my breath. During times of stress I tend to take quick shallow breaths and forget to breathe fully. This technique helped me slow down my thought process.Once I slowed down my thoughts, I began to observe the world around me much more deeply. I took time to observe nature and marvel at all the miraculous things that occur in the natural world. This prompted me to be more conscious of living in the moment and be grateful for the things I had in my life.Gratitude stems from wanting the things you have rather than continually chasing what you do not.Action 02: Don\u2019t take life too seriouslySometimes I can get too wrapped up in the stress of work and life.I used to stress quite a lot about work and found it difficult to transition between work mode and personal mode. Often I would remain stuck in professional mode for too long. This achieved little except draining the life energy out of me.It is important to be able to switch effortlessly between the two modes, interject laughter into my day and leave any work stress behind me once I clock off.Action 03: Practice the technique of loving kindnessThis technique was pioneered by Chade-Meng Tan, a software engineer who previously worked at Google.The technique is pretty simple. Look or think about a person and say to yourself \u201cI wish for this person to be happy\u201d. That is it. An exercise that takes less than 10 seconds.Alternatively I can try variations of the technique such as:Once an hour randomly identify two people walking past me and secretly wish for each of them to be happy. Or incorporate this technique into a meditation practice. Simply sit with a certain person or two in mind and wish them to be happy.Try it and see what effect it has on you over a week.Action 04: Self acceptance and self loveThis is perhaps the most important action and can take a long time to conquer, as it may never be possible to conquer it fully.It is only when I love myself that I can truly begin to love others and show them true compassion and kindness. I am in a better position to help others if I have already tended to my own needs. The first step towards helping others is to first help yourself. It may seem selfish but is it the kindest thing I can do. It is important that I make sure I am ok first. I believe that this is the stepping stone to creating a better world.After first being kind to myself , I am more likely to extend the same kindness to others.I rarely know what another person is really going through.Case in point I have a friend who was going through a depressive episode in his life. One day he mustered up the energy to leave the house and go for a walk. This is no easy feat when caught in the grips of depression.While on the walk, a group of youths egged him. This story broke my heart.So be nice.Treat others as you would like them to treat you. If I can be a happy human it creates ripples of happiness which extends to others and encourage them to also be better humans.Do you have any habits or steps you take to become a happy being? I would love to hear them!Written byWritten by","8465":"You\u2019ve just been told your outfit sucks.Not in so many words. But the way that woman looked at you. The way she ran her eyes the length of your body. The way she squinted at your scuffed boots. You. Could. Just. Tell.You know you shouldn\u2019t take these things personally. You should detach. Walk away. Adopt a Zen-like expression and fill your mind with clich\u00e9s: seek only to control what you can control; your opinion of me matters less than my opinion of myself; what others think of me is none of my business.Except that it is your business. You go home. You stand in front of the mirror. You recall her face. Her scorn. And suddenly this has nothing to do with her. It\u2019s all about you: your bad hair, your off-trend taste in clothes, the weight you\u2019ve gained, your lumpy body, your insecurity, your self-dislike.You have taken That Woman\u2019s Look to heart \u2014 and it hurts.The world is a confusing place; so are the people in it. Sometimes people are mean to us. Sometimes they\u2019re not but we tell ourselves they are. Sometimes we\u2019re just too sensitive for our own good.So here\u2019s a guide for working out the difference \u2014 and some advice for dealing with your critics.First, check your vital signs.If your Yes answers above dominate the rest it might be time to thicken up your skin a little. Sensitivity is commendable but you also have to allow for living in a world where not everyone will like, or rate, you. Sometimes, too, negative feedback can be helpful \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way.So here are some ways to deal with your critics:Just do nothing. Nice, well-meaning critics will understand you are struggling with your feelings. Mean people will be disappointed because you\u2019ve given them nothing to attack. If you are upset in a work setting quietly take time out. You can ask for clarity and plan your strategy later.Highly sensitive people tend to place themselves at the centre of their own Universe. It\u2019s sad (but also wonderful) that other people are not all that interested in you. Mostly their criticisms are the product of their own beliefs and experiences which is worth remembering.Go on, be sneaky \u2014 they won\u2019t know. Take an analytical view of the person giving the negative feedback. Their comments and the way they deliver them tell you really interesting (and often scary) things about them and the way they see the world. You might begin to see they have more troubles \u2014 and fewer friends \u2014 than you.Be honest about what\u2019s going on here. Check your relationship with your critic. Is this feedback being delivered with kindness? Or does this person have an agenda and\/or critical history. It might be time to do a relationship stock take. But if there\u2019s a grain of truth in the criticism, we need to face it \u2014 when we\u2019re ready. Knowing our weaknesses can give us an opportunity to grow and improve.Every time you deal with criticism well, every time you stop yourself from overreacting, ruminating-things-to-death or beating up on yourself, notice it and bank it. Self-investment is the best deposit of all.Thanks for reading!

As a dynamic healer of color, who practices Reiki and Breathwork, but also works in Tech and admits to drinking champagne and indulging in tacos, I don\u2019t fit that image. Despite the discrepancy between my identity and that of the majority of healers in this space, I still knew that I belonged in the healing world \u2014 and became determined to find my place in it.It was important to me that I serve as an example for dynamic healers, especially the healers of color who want to walk this path. I am not so egocentric to think I revolutionized the world of healers of color by myself. The path that lead me here hasn\u2019t been easy, it still isn\u2019t, but there are so many women who I adore that came before me in the wellness world such as Latham Thomas, Lalah Delia, Maryam Hasnaa, Erica Chidi Cohen, and Chloe Garcia Ponce to name a few, that showed me it was possible. These women affirmed that I can be my most authentic self, while bringing my unique voice and capabilities to the world, but the market is still saturated with the promotion of white perfectly branded women and it\u2019s my passion to help revolutionize representation of the wellness industry.It\u2019s not lost on me that the majority of my teachers to date have been white women, but to their credit, they all have deliberately acknowledged their privilege as a means of trying to ask questions for personal growth and empathy. Not only that, they have supported those who can\u2019t by recognizing the work of Black Lives Matter, acknowledging that ancestral trauma is real, and prompting difficult conversations about cultural appropriation.Sadly, this sentiment isn\u2019t the industry norm and there have been countless examples of white women remaining uncomfortably silent in moments of difficulty. One of the most egregious examples of this problem today is \u201cManifestation Advisor\u201d and founder of Free and Native, Lacy Phillips.We all have to figure out the reason why we were put on earth, and I was able to conclude that I\u2019m here to merge the business and new age worlds in large part because of Lacy\u2019s teachings, which revolve around unblocking parts of your subconscious in order to become free and arrive at your \u201ctrue native essence.\u201d If you\u2019re a patient or friend of mine, heck maybe maybe even a complete stranger, I have probably brought up this work.However, I\u2019ve begun to notice her absence in prominent conversations about the state of the world; she\u2019s had nothing to say about the constant atrocities coming out of the Trump administration, in particular what ICE is doing to families at the border, #MeToo, or Black Lives Matter. I\u2019m not alone in this frustration. Jordan Pag\u00e1n, founder of Ostara Apothecary stated \u201cI\u2019ve waited for Lacy to say something about well, anything.\u201d She continued, \u201cTo stay silent or neutral is to choose the side of the oppressor, and also an enormous privilege. She has an enormous platform and it takes two seconds to share a link or repost. Lacy could have really helped and yet chose complicity. There are so many other \u2018brands\u2019 out there who are talking about this and doing what they can to help, but not her.\u201d When a \u201cbrand\u201d with a cult following like Free and Native, stays silent in this turbulent time, the silence becomes deafening.As Nisha Moodley said on white female fragility, \u201cOne of the great lies I believe white women have historically been sold is the lie of their own fragility & innocence\u2026Just say no\u2026If we don\u2019t, that lie of fragility becomes its own weapon of racism, used consciously & unconsciously. It happens when people of color speak and others shut down, get defensive, or feel bruised or victimized by their truth.\u201dLacy\u2019s ability to sit pretty in her complicity has bothered me for some time largely because I saw her as an expander whose work I was heavily invested in. I knew my intuition was trying to tell me something, but I wasn\u2019t sure what, but two weeks ago, I began to see why.There are several Free and Native \u201cvillages,\u201d which serve as networks for followers from all over the world. After Lacy interviewed Jenna Zoe on her podcast, Expanded (the episode has now been deleted), some of their comments on feminism not only rubbed members of various villages the wrong way, but also prompted them to start a thread on the Free and Native Facebook page.The thread took off and Lacy eventually responded two days later by posting a video about how it\u2019s good that people were triggered by what she said and that it\u2019s their shadow. Oh no.Of course, that backfired and more people got involved in the conversation. She posted another video where she cried and made comments about how she is not racist because she doesn\u2019t see color and has a Persian uncle \u2014 oh boy \u2014 the \u201cI am not a racist because I have a black friend card\u201d too!Members started calling her out for these comments, particularly as it relates to her use of the word \u201cnative\u201d while refusing to address issues that affect people that are well, native. Instead of addressing the criticism or taking this as an opportunity to grow, Lacy and her team started tone policing, blocking and deleting members from this group.The moment I was finally waiting for happened and Lacy posted a third video thanking everyone for their comments and asking for resources to help educate herself on white privilege. She might have been ready to learn, but it was clear that some of her white female peers in the wellness industry, were not. For example, Dana Scmalenberg, founder of GEM+REMEDY, jumped in to say that all \u201cthis\u201d was not why they were on the page and began instigating arguments with other commenters. This clearly was past the point of being a total shit show \u2014 members getting kicked out left and right for trying to engage in intellectual and progressive conversation, as a means of trying to help a woman who was past the point of helping herself.Maybe I felt inspired by Olivia Pope after six seasons of obsessing over Scandal, but I felt compelled to chime in with the hope of lending assistance to another healer (and a brand) I promote and support in my own life and work. As a healer of color, I felt like I could offer real help to Lacy when she asked for resources. I too, was then blocked. To add insult to injury, I also began to see that majority of other members blocked by Free and Native administrators where women of color.One thing being a Real Housewives fan and ex politico has taught me is to document everything so you can produce receipts. I saw (and have access to) countless posts from women whose words were eloquent and needed. I saw meaningful conversation and an outpouring of people who wanted to help not just the Free and Native society be better, but society as a whole. But I think Lacy saw something different. Allies defending the women of color being kicked out of the group started to get kicked out as well and a disclaimer was posted to the group about bullying. Enter, gaslighting.Lacy went silent for a few days and then posted another video. This time, she reset the boundaries of the group \u2014 stating that anything outside of talking about manifestation would not be tolerated \u2014 no talk about politics or social justice issues. That is her right, it is her brand, so do you boo. But, to call the pain she caused in so many of her followers social justice issues does not come from a place of love.Lacy Phillips is an example of how the wellness industry parallels just about every other industry in America \u2014 from the education system, prison system and health system. These comments perpetuate systemic racism. And at the risk of playing into the \u201cangry black woman\u201d card \u2014 I am not here for it.Lacy, you can block me, but I won\u2019t be silenced.You are not woke if you do not see color. You are uncomfortable talking about race and that is exactly the problem and the sign that you need to continue to do the work. Your discomfort dealing with topics of white supremacy, white privilege, demonstrated unwillingness to admit fault, and refusal to walk the path of a learner when it comes to this area where you are completely ignorant and actively problematic is dangerous. It is congruent to stating you are perfect and have nothing to learn by refusing to address this obvious shortcoming in yourself and your community.When you walk the path of a healer, a guru, an advisor, whatever you want to call yourself in the public eye you have great responsibility. We cannot minimize or belittle the pain of others. We can\u2019t refuse to work on our own continued growth. We must be conscious of our influence.As my muse Olivia Pope would say, \u201cDo you want to stand in the sun?\u201d Cause right now you are standing in the greatest shadowy bits of yourself you preach about, my love.And with that I open my heart to you. I open my guidance and forgiveness. Call me. Let\u2019s talk. I want to help you sort this out. I want you to receive forgiveness from the women of color who you have healed and now retraumatized. But, I know you\u2019re not ready to confront this part of yourself \u2014 but I pray in due time that changes for you. I hope you grow to want to stop white supremacy in the wellness industry.This is not the take down of another woman, this is the take down of a standard. As another Free and Native member stated, \u201cI\u2019m not anti-Free and Native, but I do think that having a community that is conscious is important in this day and age and Lacy Phillips has made it abundantly clear that she is not planning to use her platform to effect change of this sorts.\u201dI want all of her followers who do care to start reevaluating which healers, gurus, and advisors you currently follow. Where do they stand? How do they use their voices and various platforms to affect the change you want to see in the world? Do you want to support yet another white women build a thriving (and lucrative) space for spiritual communities, but only pushes beauty products on you, while ignoring what is going on in the world around them? A leader who is called out for their lack of diversity and inclusion and not only ignores it \u2014 but dismisses it? If yes, then DO YOU. ALWAYS DO YOU.If you want to help contribute to the collective awakening and build a community of consciousness, put your support behind other brands that actually care.Most importantly \u2014 become your own healer. That means doing what is best for you, without relying on the teachings of Lacy Philips, myself and the millions of teachers out there. Your power to affect change starts with you.For any healers of color reading this \u2014 how can we band together to change the face of \u201cwellness,\u201d so it\u2019s not dominated by brands such as Free and Native? While we\u2019re at it, where are my Queer healers at? Where are my healers with disabilities? Where are my allies? We are all in this together. I want to hear your ideas and start working to making them a reality. If we can\u2019t face and solve for these issues in this particular industry, how can we help heal the world?My people aren\u2019t free, however we are sure native and with that comes deep pain that is difficult to process. But with that pain also comes the sort of magic that has the capability to change not just an industry, but the whole damn world.Written byWritten by","8588":"I just want you to be happy, we tell our kids as they step into the world.I understand why we say this. We\u2019re usually just coming off the back of the teenage years and all they brought with them: alcohol, drugs, bullying and friendship issues, mental health troubles, gaming, social media, sex and porn. Even if you didn\u2019t knock up against one of these personally you\u2019ll be only too aware of others who have.So it\u2019s fair to want happiness for our kids \u2014 and less angst for ourselves.But we need to stop there.Because telling young people we want them to be happy is the tallest order of all: I mean, how many people do you know who are basking in joy juice? I haven\u2019t met many and when I do I remember them.As a psychologist I see lots of young people, not necessarily clinically depressed and anxious, but paralysed by indecision and worried about their futures. What should I study? What career path should I take? What if I make the wrong choice? What if I waste time and money? What if I let people down? What if I don\u2019t live up to the dream?So happiness is not something they can comprehend, let alone chase down. Besides, their concept of a happy life and relationship is often (sadly) quite different from the one we have modelled to them.We can\u2019t change the complex, crazy, competitive world we\u2019re living in, but we can release the pressure valve on our kids by giving them better advice or, when appropriate, no advice at all.Here are a few (well-meaning) tips.Just start something. Part of the fun of life is NOT knowing where it\u2019s going. Clarity of purpose is a fine aim but not a very realistic one when you are young and living in the 21st Century. Trying too hard to figure out the end-game takes away the pleasure of the moment and applies pressure you don\u2019t need \u2014 and may not yet be equipped to handle.Give up the passion hunt. Only a rare few have their pathway lit from a very early age. Most of us need to explore, try things, stumble and mess up. All of it adds to your knowledge, experiences and perspective. So go be curious, and learn things, instead.Decisions come and go. So do choices. Whatever choice you are facing won\u2019t be the last one you ever have so don\u2019t give it that much power. Over-hyping it will make you fearful and timid when it\u2019s better (and healthier) to go bold. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out you\u2019ll learn things.Nothing is wasted. Even that monotonous, minimum-wage job you think is beneath you has something to offer or to teach you. Your mission is to look for it.Whatever you do, throw your heart over the bar. Being one foot in, one foot out prevents you from fully engaging with anything from jobs to interests to relationships. Don\u2019t be half-hearted about your life. Deliver your whole self to whatever the task at hand and see what happens.Self care, learning, creativity and nourishment are huge. Build up tools and strategies to arm you for the crap that invariably comes to all of us. Keep your personal tank full so you can reach in when you\u2019re struggling, as well as reach out to others when you need to.Anything counts. As long as you\u2019re not hurting yourself or anyone else. Laugh long and loud at nothing much. The world doesn\u2019t have enough joy in it.Thanks for reading!

I really didn\u2019t want it. I actively sought mental health help for a decade already; it wasn\u2019t working, and I\u2019d hit rock bottom. I was done. I wanted to die, and I contemplated ways in which to make it happen.My husband pleaded that I try to get help one more time\u2026and he said he\u2019d even set up the appointment. I gave in. OK, fine. One more time, but I had zero hope that it would help. Serious doubt ruled my mind.My husband set an appointment for me at a Dallas hospital for an evaluation to determine whether or not I needed to be committed for treatment or receive outpatient treatment. He also made an appointment for me to see a psychiatrist. I just needed to hold on a little longer. An ounce of hope was kindled. This all occurred in December 2013.As the hospital appointment date approached, my husband received a phone call from the hospital\u2026cancelling the appointment. They wanted to reschedule for after the holidays. He was dumbfounded\u2026so was I. How could they do this when they have been told I\u2019ve been suicidal?! I didn\u2019t think I could keep holding on. There had been a tiny flicker of hope, and it was snuffed out by the facility that was supposed to offer it.By a miracle, I reached the date of the psychiatry appointment. In a nutshell, this is the doc I didn\u2019t think existed. The one that eventually got me back on track. The one who gave me an accurate diagnosis and treatment.During 2014, life was still a struggle, but life was also improving. I worked a lot on myself. Not everyone could tell (because I was an ace at putting on a mask when needed), but my family could tell things were looking up.A hobby, by definition, is an activity pursued for pleasure. We all need a bit of that in our daily lives.In January 2015, I discovered the company Steeped Tea, Inc., a direct sales company.I contacted someone in the biz and inundated her with questions. I had nothing to lose. Even if I didn\u2019t bring in money with this\u2026I still got my personal discount. Two more reasons I wanted to join:I had already started raising funds for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. I decided I could continue to do so by donating a portion of my tea profits. This provided me another purpose in life.It has a calming effect on me, temporarily\u2026but worth it\u2026most likely due to the process\/ritual of making it right. Then, a favorite mug, a favorite tea, and a cozy place to sit and contemplate. It\u2019s my \u201ctea meditation\u201d. It\u2019s just another modicum of my personal mental health and self-care plan.So, in the midst of life\u2019s turmoils that blow in like a hurricane, a cup of tea is a small eye of my personal storm.If you want to donate directly to AFSP, here\u2019s my AFSP link\u2026If you haven\u2019t checked out Life, So Daily, give it a look HERE.You can find Life, So Daily with Alicia T.

But most of us don\u2019t ever consider or understand the immediate and long-term consequences of drinking.There\u2019s a social pressure to drink alcohol. Its something most of us take up in early adolescence without much thought or reflection.Those who continue to drink alcohol in adulthood typically do so for several reasons:\u25cf To \u2018have a good time,\u2019 relax and release inhibitions\u25cf To \u2018fit in\u2019 and bond with people\u25cf To blow off some steam and take their mind off the stressful week they\u2019ve just had.It\u2019s the done thing, something you\u2019re brought up to accept is normal (\u2018in moderation\u2019) and commonplace. It is ubiquitous in the professional sphere also, for example:\u25cf To welcome \/ say goodbye to a colleague\u25cf Celebrating success on a new project\u25cf Team bonding and \u2018social\u2019 activities.Alcohol is often proposed as the solution and answer to all these scenarios, and many more.There have also been several times in my life where I have gone for many weeks without drinking.I have even done a few dry Januaries before with relative ease.After these periods I have found myself in a place of optimism, focus and concentration, peace and relaxation and crucially, in succeeding with whatever I had set my mind to.A quick point here on terminology. \u2018Teetotal\u2019 means absolute, complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages. It means indefinite sobriety and outright rejection of intoxication.In April this year I decided to end my dubious relationship with alcohol.For several years I\u2019ve fantasized about being teetotal, and realised it would only be a matter of when, and not if I would decide to make the jump.Ultimately it was a particularly exhausting work week, followed by a series of extremely awkward, tiresome and uncomfortable social experiences over that weekend which led me to say to myself:\u201cNever again.\u201dIn my final year at university I struggled severely with social anxiety and a deep depression, so much so that I consistently contemplated whether I should bother continuing to live.I fell out with my three best friends and became isolated, sinking into melancholic thinking patterns and a vortex of negativity of my own making.Alcohol was a relatively regular fixture in my life in this adolescent period when I was socialising.Going on a two or three-day bender would seriously detriment my mental state.I would binge on an absolute cocktail of drinks to mask my own sadness, so my own company was just about bearable for others, and sometimes vice versa.I turned this around when I resolved to meet the dissertation deadline that had been given to me in that final year.This was the only thing I was focused on for a month in the summer of 2011 \u2014 as the US government was shut down in the debt-ceiling crisis, and England experienced its worst riots for decades.In this period my alcohol consumption was low to negligible. My only task was going to the library six days a week for 10+ hours \u2014 stopping only to eat meals, wash, sleep and listen to the Test Match Special podcast as England hammered India 4\u20130 in the cricket.The next long period of nominal alcohol drinking was the following summer, when I was resolutely focused on securing my first full-time paid job after graduating.My internship at a think-tank in the City of London was coming to an end and I was calmly and persistently applying for jobs and preparing for interviews.It seemed the whole country was bordering on hysteria with the London Olympic Games. Like with the drama the previous summer, I paid it all cursory glances of my attention, but never to extent that it interfered with my goals of getting a foot-hold in politics and kicking on with fulfilling my potential.I also politely turned down the opportunity to join my friends on a lads holiday in Turkey that summer. I decided reluctantly but firmly that I could not justify splashing out on such a boozy endeavour when I hadn\u2019t even secured full-time salaried employment.The result of making this decision meant I was able to progress my career and earning potential unapologetically at a very important point in my professional life.The final occasion where I experienced wonderful benefits from alcohol abstention was when I was training for my first \u2018white collar\u2019 boxing match last year.For a nine week period from August to November I didn\u2019t consume a single drop of alcohol. I concluded that there was no advantage whatsoever in that boxing scenario for me continuing to drink alcohol.This enabled me to think more clearly, strategically and with more optimism than I could from weeks and weeks of indulging in red wine, whiskey and beer.I\u2019ve given up alcohol because:I feel better without it.I feel like I\u2019m a better person - more focused, patient, and mature.I have more energy.I behave more responsibly, and act like a fool less.I keep better company.I sleep better.I am more peaceful in my mind and soul. I can think properly, without over-analysing or catastrophising.You are the CEO of a large organisation \u2014 it is called \u2018your life.\u2019 You are responsible for all major decisions, accountable for what you say and do.You are responsible, to a large extent, for the people you associate and meet with.As the CEO of my life and the one responsible for hiring and firing my staff, I realised I could not stand up and look others in the eye and justify keeping a particular employee who damages my otherwise successful organisation.This employee gets me into trouble, although I always take sole responsibility. The employee is lazy, unproductive, often rude and causes income losses. They stop the organisation from reaching its potential. As a result of keeping this employee around, opportunities are missed.Our competitors race ahead at points, are involved in successful mergers and collaborations which bring exciting new products and services to the market.Our organisation is relatively respected, popular even, but not quite with the same respect as we deserve. Other people say the disruptive, errant employee is well-intentioned and harmless in small doses. They\u2019re a drain on resources, confidence and the general morale and ethos of the organisation.This employee represents alcohol in my life.As the CEO of everything in my life, I could no longer justify alcohol\u2019s presence. I held myself fully accountable and decided to fire them.We\u2019re all playing up to certain roles at times.And the media and popular culture portrays alcoholism as something that is edgy, trendy or \u2018right on\u2019.A good example of this portrayal is Detective Jimmy McNulty, from HBO\u2019s TV series The Wire.Despite being a fictional character (magnificently played by Dominic West) he is someone who best represents the person I want to be as far away from as possible.Jimmy McNulty is someone who friends and family members have shared many jokes and funny conversations about.But I\u2019m highlighting him as someone I don\u2019t want to look up to, or admire in any way.McNulty\u2019s a second-generation Irishman, like me. He\u2019s also an alcoholic.He\u2019s a very poor husband and father to his family. He drives under the influence and is on a reckless path of self-destruction very often in the series.On some level there\u2019s a pressure on those of us with Irish heritage to be big drinkers.From some maybe there\u2019s an expectation that we should, like McNulty, overindulge and behave like a ladies man or womaniser. Some may find this image to be superficially attractive on the surface.Males can be portrayed very poorly in the media. Absent fathers. Addicted to work and substances. Unfaithful to their partners.We snigger and laugh at these Jack the Lad characters and enjoy their portrayal in films and TV shows.But if we flip this and say if that was your dad, or your brother, your son, or your best friend for example, these scenes would be less amusing for us.Ask anyone whose parents are alcoholics.There\u2019s not much funny, sociable or interesting about that. And people call you \u2018boring\u2019 or think you\u2019re strange, not a real man, for trying to break a cycle of addiction and a pattern of discord and not complacently hand it onto another generation.Its not something I want to aspire to be. I don\u2019t want to live up to a stereotype or meekly accept values that while subtly expected of me, are not ones I agree with.I know many second-generation Irish people my age who accept this paradigm of alcohol abuse, partly because that\u2019s what everyone else in their social group is doing.It\u2019s not necessary. It\u2019s not you, it\u2019s just an idea in your head.But these roles are quite seductive, as is alcohol itself. The ideas that come with it are firmly entrenched with some people.And while they\u2019re difficult to let go, that\u2019s what I\u2019m determined to do.Alcohol makes me perform below my best. It lowers my vibration and energy levels. It leaves me often in an embarrassed state.I am less productive as the hangovers take me two or three days to recover from. As a result I\u2019m more stressed and less grounded.It leads me to do things I wouldn\u2019t do otherwise:\u25cf I make bad choices over what to eat\u25cf I manage my money poorly\u25cf My relationships and social encounters become more unstable and shallow\u25cf I play up to be a clown and oafish character \u2014 trying to make people laugh at the expense of my own dignity.I want to be in control of my own destiny. I want to be in charge of my own faculties because I am in charge.I\u2019m choosing to reject a substance that gets in the way of that freedom.Alcohol has become a burden, like a millstone around my neck. It is a heavy weight that brings much regret, discomfort and difficulty to my life.Alcohol:\u25cf interferes with the things that motivate me and that I\u2019m passionate about\u25cf puts me in the company of people who don\u2019t share my interests, values or motivations\u25cf encourages me to abuse my health and my self-image.No-one disputes that it lowers your vibration. We all accept this is a consequence of drinking, but we still do it.This induces a low energy state in us. Alcohol is fundamentally a depressant, making you more likely to experience depressed thoughts and emotions.It\u2019s like a building your own prison cell around you. You are locking yourself away from accessing higher states and all the positivity, lightness and sublime feelings available up there.Being teetotal is like being drunk for me now. The equivalent of feeling free, authentic and uninhibited.Alcohol and peak states don\u2019t mix.Being less hungover and inebriated means I have more clarity and concentration in my life.Since giving up alcohol five months ago, there is more space in my life to fill it with meaningful things \u2014 like volunteering in Africa, training hard in the gym or putting on public speaking workshops.This year I\u2019ve been trying to improve my relationships with the people around me and relate to them in more of an authentic way.\u201cYou must be willing to destroy anything in your life that isn\u2019t excellent\u201dJoe PolishAnd the question people might ask me, understandably, is, \u201cWhy have you given up alcohol?\u201dBut the question never asked is: \u201cWhy did you take it up? Why did you start drinking?\u201dYou\u2019d probably ask a friend struggling with addiction why they started doing cocaine, or gambling or watching pornography.The same question isn\u2019t asked for alcohol, because it\u2019s a large and socially acceptable part of our culture.No questions asked. Nothing to see here guv.Alcohol is often seen as a shorthand way of identifying whether someone is sociable or friendly, and it\u2019s bollocks.In my experience, some of the most miserable, vacuous and close-minded people I know are those who spend the most time \u2018socialising\u2019 or who put away the most booze.Having said that, there are clearly advantages to alcohol. It can make social interactions easier for many people.It can relax you, and one or two drinks could help two people get to know each other a bit more easily.You lose your inhibitions and in theory it\u2019s a fun thing in moderation. Although it can be difficult for people in their twenties to decide what \u2018moderation\u2019 means.However, I came clearly to realise that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits in an undeniable way.I have told people that my decision not to drink may be perceived by others as if I am putting up a barrier.This is not my intention, but I\u2019ve accepted that some will come to this inaccurate conclusion, whatever I say about it.Regardless of others\u2019 conclusions of my desire to live a clean life, in which I am in control and have the freedom from the effects of alcohol, I believe this is the right thing to do \u2014 and potentially the best decision I will ever make.I wish there was a way to be able to enjoy alcohol in moderation with none of the consequences.It\u2019s a big sacrifice and commitment to deny yourself something that\u2019s a lot of fun.I realise that I\u2019m leaving all sorts of experiences on the table. Some positive things may not now happen because of my decisions.But there will also be more positive things happening to me because I\u2019m trying to keep my mind, body, and soul completely free from alcohol\u2019s influences.To help me stay off it, I remind myself that I\u2019ve fully committed to putting my health first, and putting my goals and passions above this ubiquitous thing that we\u2019ve convinced ourselves that we have to do.One of the challenges is the perception, and the idea that alcohol is often associated with shared experiences in social settings.I\u2019m already experiencing the pressure from others to \u201cjoin\u201d them in ordering alcoholic drinks when in a bar or restaurant.My plan to stay committed to this involves a simple combination of ordering:\u25cf Sparkling or still water with a fresh lime\u25cf Mocktails (like Virgin Mary or Mojito)\u25cf Fruit juice or smoothies (to much ribbing I\u2019m sure!).I\u2019ve recently made friends with long-time abstainers and I think a few of my other pals will join me in abstention in the near future based on conversations I\u2019ve had with them.There are many strategies you can adopt to make this transition. Trial it for one weekend a month, and then for weeks and months at a time.Sign up to a race or competitive sporting event which will require some discipline in diet and preparation. This will give you a plausible pretext for not drinking (like my boxing match).Fewer people will be hostile to it and question the rationale for it.Over time you become more used to having a clear head and a cleaner life.Making the decision permanent will be a natural step in this process you\u2019ve already started.It\u2019d be lying however if I said there wasn\u2019t an element of loss or sadness in my thoughts at points in this process.But what causes me more sadness is realising how much misery the misuse of this substance causes, and how recklessly it is defended by people who don\u2019t fully understand its many consequences.A recent major study from the University of Washington has concluded that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption.The study also suggests that alcohol is one of the major causes of death in the world today (nearly 3 million deaths in 2016).Alcohol degrades families, squanders potential and drains our life-force.Watching people close to you effectively become deranged and lobotimised from alcoholism, is equally sadness-inducing.I wish it didn\u2019t have to be this drastic, that it didn\u2019t have to go this far.But sometimes you have to do something radical to effect any meaningful change.Nothing changes, if nothing changes.\u201cWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit\u201dWill DurantWritten byWritten by","8746":"Who amongst us hasn\u2019t heard of the \u201cdigital detox\u201d? In essence, the digital detox is the process of ridding oneself of toxins and unhealthy substances generated by prolonged technology use. In the past few years, digital detoxing has grown from an idea to a brand to, for many, a guide for how to think and live.Today I\u2019m writing to note that the digital detox should die, and for good reason.Let\u2019s get to the facts: There is no doubt in anyone\u2019s mind that in our current era of TVs, computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, we overuse technology. These tools of technology have fundamentally changed how we communicate. Today, these tools function as essentials for completing everyday tasks at home and in the workplace.The usage figures themselves are more than a little shocking:For personal research, I\u2019ve even used an online survey to assess how much technology people I know use per day, with over half of my participants reporting a daily use of over five hours.This technology overuse is increasingly, though often indirectly, linked to conditions including stress, anxiety, social isolation, depression, and insomnia. All of these are known to contribute to burnout, but I predict that the digital detox is just the wrong solution to this problem of technology overuse.Personally, I\u2019m not addicted to technology per se, but I do use it to work remotely, stay connected with friends and family, and stream movies, which, in hindsight, may seem like a lot. I had noticed not long ago that through my technology use I had unknowingly developed a pattern of bad habits, a few of which I have listed below:In short, I was exhausted all the time.The image you probably have of me in your head right now is someone who looks a little like Gollum from Lord of the Rings, and my friends may jokingly argue that this is a pretty accurate representation! But in reality I am a healthy, exercise-conscious person, and always have been. My current lifestyle contrasts with the 10 years of my life which I spent in an elite military unit where my office was the outdoors, and I would literally live for weeks at a time directly under the stars in places all over the world. It wasn\u2019t until I left that career and became a full-time student at a prestigious U.K. university that I began to use technology for hours on end without a break, every single day.In short, I developed these bad habits during my time as a student, and left them unchecked for so long that I carried them with me into my work life.S o what were the physical and mental effects of all this technology overuse? Well, physically I lost weight. The lack of sleep affected my eating habits and decreased my energy levels. My eyesight, which had always been 20\/20, deteriorated. I began to struggle to see objects that were far away, simply because I was spending long periods staring at a digital screen only a few inches from my face.Mentally, the effects were much worse. My confidence plummeted, and I stopped seeing friends and spending time with my girlfriend. I was exhausted all day, everyday, and used the little energy I did have just to stay on top of my work. I gradually became depressed without even realizing it, which only prevented me from stepping outside more and being around other people. In short, I came dangerously close to being burnt out.It was at this point that I knew something had to change, so I reflected on my bad habits and tried to begin addressing them; not by detoxing from technology use altogether, but by trying to be more careful about my use.Be in control of your technology use \u2014 don\u2019t let it control you.Gradually, I began to set boundaries and stick to them. I started going to the gym every morning and didn\u2019t check my phone until I was done with my workout, learning in the process that the world is not going to end if I don\u2019t reply to every email right away. I made a point of meeting and spending time with friends, just chatting and drinking. I now have a definite cutoff time in the evenings for when I stop using my laptop. I also only read in bed now, which has led to deeper, longer, and unbroken periods of sleep.Very quickly I started noticing myself becoming healthier, happier, and having much more energy. This period of change differs from a \u201cdigital detox\u201d the way we understand it today because I didn\u2019t lock all my devices in a box and abstain from technology use altogether, or delete all my social media accounts entirely, or put myself at the metaphorical top of a mountain for longer than a weekend.M y experience teaches me that the \u201cdigital detox\u201d needs to die because it is a fundamentally flawed concept. Three reasons explain this: First, the term \u201cdetox\u201d has several negative connotations. It implies addiction and dependency, which removes your agency in decision-making and practicing sound judgement over your health and happiness. This, in turn, renders you subject to your digital addiction, unable to make clear decisions and take control without outside support.Secondly, the idea of surrendering your devices, or deleting your social media and going cold turkey, is actually a rather oppressive and unnecessary approach. It almost creates a prison-like environment in which you can only control your behavior when your distractions are taken away.Ironically, this in turn creates a situation in which you are rewarded with your devices or apps at the end of your detox period if you are good and obey the rules. If you delete your social media and abstain from using your devices, you get to use them once the detox period is over. It just doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.Thirdly, it implies that without outside support to motivate you, a detox is, by definition, difficult to achieve. This is wrong, and belief in this prevents most people from managing their technology use much better. For example, 65 percent of Americans somewhat or strongly agree that periodically unplugging is important for their mental health, but only 28 percent of those actually report doing so.Now, spas and boutiques offer more affluent clientele opportunities to digitally detox while partaking in their services, and companies prioritizing employee health have started treating their staff to bespoke packages or retreats in order to get them away from their devices for certain periods of time.A more practical approach to the digital detox is to work with the simple fact that most of us do not suffer from a severe addiction to technology and do not actually need, or are not realistically able to, engage in a hardcore detox from it. For those who do suffer from an actual addiction to technology, help can come in the form of professional behavioral therapy, or a rehabilitative experience that promises the necessary services and support to address issues of addiction.Instead of detoxing, many of the rest of us should get comfortable with the idea of detaching from our technology periodically.Instead of detoxing, many of the rest of us should get comfortable with the idea of detaching from our technology periodically. Detaching means keeping our devices and social media apps, but using them only when necessary or within an ordained limit. Many of us, for example, don\u2019t need to aimlessly scroll through our phones on a bus or train to help pass the time, since it is bad for our eyes and is almost always unrewarding. Instead, read a book and expand your mind. I\u2019m currently reading The Worst Journey in the World \u2014 a true story about the early Antarctic explorers and Robert Falcon Scott\u2019s ill-fated final expedition \u2014 which is pretty fascinating and inspiring stuff.Unlike a digital detox where you either surrender your devices, delete all your social media apps, or, ironically, use an app to block all your other apps (a digital response to a digital problem?!) a detach requires you to make conscious decisions about when and how you use your technology. In this is a more powerful lesson which gives you the power to pull back at any time or context.When you detach you are in control all the time. It is a mind game in which you play against you, and in which there can only be one winner in the end.I challenge you to forget about detoxing and embrace the concept of detaching. Choose a time when you would usually use your device; for example, just before bed. Rather than pulling out your device to watch Netflix or scroll through the news, make the choice to read a book in bed. Instead of taking your laptop to a caf\u00e9 to work or catch up on social media, make the choice to go for a coffee with a friend, leaving your laptop at home and putting your phone on silent, so you can really be in the moment without any digital distractions.In short, be in control of your technology use\u2014don\u2019t let it control you. I think you\u2019ll find, as I did, that you\u2019ll be much healthier and happier as a result.Written byWritten by","8767":"In an earlier blog post, I reviewed a bestselling book by Dr. Dale Bredesen called The End of Alzheimer\u2019s. Intrigued, I embarked on my own journey to see where I stand on the risk spectrum for developing Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. It turns out that at only thirty-eight years of age, I am well on my way down that road and I am willing to bet that you are, too.Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored. \u2014 Aldous HuxleyBy some estimates, half of the people alive in the United States today can expect to develop Alzheimer\u2019s within their lifetime. In the past twenty years, the number of women in America living with Alzheimer\u2019s disease has increased by 228%. Alzheimer\u2019s is the only leading cause of death in this country that cannot be prevented, cured or effectively treated.But what if it\u2019s not a disease at all? Perhaps the cure is not in a pill but rather, in knowledge and individual choice. People living with Alzheimer\u2019s have experienced complete reversal of their symptoms, as evidenced by multiple studies.Some scientists belive that by addressing and eliminating \u201cneurothreats\u201d, cognitive decline can be prevented and effectively treated. Unfortunately, some of these same scientists are developing proprietary protocols to offer these therapeutic programs to the general public for extensive amounts of money.I think that is a crock. If you can save the world, do it for free.I worked with my doctor to get an extensive wellness exam, or \u201ccognoscopy\u201d. You can read more about the detailed lab work in my previous blog post. The goal was to identify risk factors in three main categories: chronic inflammation, suboptimal hormones and trophic factors, and exposure to environmental toxins.23andme provided my initial genetic health and wellness reports, some of which are useful for assessing Alzheimer\u2019s risk. In particular, the APOE gene. Since 23andme does not provide all relevant reports to satiate my curiosity, such as methylation risk factors, I uploaded my raw genetic data to a couple of outside processing services.The bill came in recently for my lab testing. It is, without question, the best hundred bucks I\u2019ve ever spent. If you\u2019re interested in getting a cognoscopy and you want to know how to make this an affordable endeavor, please contact me. I am happy to share!The good news is that I do not seem to have issues with chronic inflammation, which is the first of three categories of \u201cneurothreats\u201d in Dr. Bredesen\u2019s book.The not-so-good news is that my body doesn\u2019t properly produce or utilize all hormones and trophic factors. Trophic factors are those things that make our cells function, live and die properly such as vitamins and minerals. I\u2019ve also been exposed to toxic substances. So, dings in two out of three categories.Oddly enough, I feel pretty good and I look pretty good. I\u2019m five feet eight inches, weigh 135 pounds. I work out, eat well and do a decent job of managing my stress. I pass my annual physicals (when I go!) with flying colors. By all accounts, I am the picture of health and I would have just gone on believing that and so would my doctor.And I would probably develop Alzheimer\u2019s.I believe that I can fix every single one of these problems by making simple changes to my lifestyle. Most of it can be addressed by changing up my diet and adding some daily supplements, like Vitamin D.While I can\u2019t change the fact that I have genetic risks for Alzheimer\u2019s and other conditions, I can change the way that my genes express by making simple lifestyle changes. A good example is the MTHFR gene. I (like an estimated 60% of caucasians) have one mutated copy of this gene. The MTHFR gene controls what is known as the DNA methylation process and when it does not work properly, it impairs the functioning of every single cell in our bodies. Things that we take for granted like how our bodies make energy from food, our brain chemistry and detoxification are all controlled by the methylation process.Just having one mutated copy, however, is appparenly not that big of a deal. But I have another mutation on another gene associated with the methylation process and so my risk is higher. My bloodwork shows evidence of impaired methylation in my body and that will get worse and worse as I age. This also increases my risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s.As much as this bums me out, I\u2019ve given up alcohol completely until my next round of bloodwork in three months. Alchohol depresses the methylation process, which truly could be a root cause of all the symptoms I am experiencing and many of the suboptimal results in my bloodwork.I must also stop vaping. I tested positive for arsenic\u2026quite a bit of it, in fact. The coils in vaping devices apparently release arsenic and lead into the body.So the plan is simple: eat the right stuff, take the right supplements and stop poisoning myself. When I go back for follow-up bloodwork in three months, I fully expect to have eliminated all neurothreats that pave the way to Alzheimer\u2019s.I\u2019m changing directions. I\u2019m getting the hell off this road to cognitive decline and onto the highway of purposeful aging.Even if Dr. Bredesen is wrong about preventing and reversing Alzheimer\u2019s, the worst case scenario is I reduce my chances of getting cancer, heart disease, diabetes and all other chronic degenerative conditions.Do you want to remain social, active and independent as you age or passively slip into cognitive and physical decline, burdening your family and society and missing out on so much of this great gift we call LIFE?We can\u2019t control everything. But what we can control, we must.Get a cognoscopy and find out what you\u2019re working with. Whatever age you are, there\u2019s no better time than now!We have met the enemy and he is us. \u2014 PogoWritten byWritten by","8790":"There are endless resources out there that describe the perfect way to meditate, the ideal way to sit in stillness and achieve that serenity that comes with non-thinking. From apps to podcasts to guided Youtube meditations, a whole market has developed to teach something so utterly simple, something that has been practiced by humankind for millennia.  It becomes laughable at a certain point and cringe-worthy beyond that when you see people actually paying for services that serve to teach them how to sit still and breathe, how to not think. The fact of the matter is that we\u2019re simply over-complicating it. Sure, you can develop an entire science behind a simple practice (say, memory function or sleeping patterns) and you can accordingly maximize and tweak said practice to perfection. Meditation, however, does not demand utmost efficiency and optimization of its process. For a master of meditation, it may be certainly be worthwhile exploring various techniques \u2014 like the breath of fire \u2014 or playing around with postures, mantras, thought-patterns, etc. But for the average person who just wants to meditate, it becomes a n increasingly daunting proposition when faced with so many how-to\u2019s, as we\u2019re led to believe that meditation is this difficult practice that requires utmost dedication, skill, and ample effort, not to mention a subscription to a service and some accessories to boot.Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 some of these services do a great service for people and I\u2019ll be the first to agree that the world is far better with them than without. But my qualm rests with over-complicating the practice of meditation in itself, which we simply need not do. The problem rests with the fact that once you try particular techniques that are being conveyed to you, you try to fit the practice of meditating into your world in a way that\u2019s not natural, like a puzzle piece that doesn\u2019t connect properly. You develop this vision of what meditating should be when, in reality, it\u2019s not so much an objective activity as it is a subjective one.And so this brings us to the secret lying behind the art of meditating effectively: there is no real secret. It\u2019s sort of an anticlimactic way to wrap up the article, so below are a few tips to help you meditate anyway.And ultimately, realize why, and then remember this reason why, you\u2019re choosing to meditate. Do you want to do it to achieve a few moments of stillness and calmness every day? Do you want to introspect or self-reflect? Do you want to achieve some sort of answer to a problem? There are different purposes towards meditating, different ways of meditating, different styles and different results for everyone. You don\u2019t need to invest time and energy into learning how but, really, just some effort to find your groove and some dedication towards keeping up with it. It doesn\u2019t hurt to look into various resources or services, so long as it\u2019s not overcomplicating a process that is really steeped in simplicity.Written byWritten by","8831":"By 1982, salt was called \u2018A New Villain\u2019 on the cover of TIME magazine. The 1988 publication of the INTERSALT study seemed to seal the deal. This massive study involved 52 centers in 32 countries and laboriously measured salt intake and compared this to blood pressure. Across all populations, the higher the salt consumption, the higher the blood pressure. Seemed like a slam dunk, although the effect was quite small. A 59% reduction in sodium intake would be predicted to lower the blood pressure by only 2 mmHG. If your systolic blood pressure was 140, severely restricting your salt could lower that to 138. However, no data existed as to whether this would translate into less heart attacks and strokes. But based on this influential study, in 1994 the mandatory Nutrition Facts Label proclaimed that Americans should only eat 2,400 mg per day (about one teaspoon of salt). Yet the stubborn fact remains that virtually every healthy population in the world eats salt at levels far above that recommendation. The dramatic improvements in health and lifespan of the last 50 years have occurred during a period where almost everybody was considered to be eating too much salt.Our belief in the benefits of low salt consumption are largely based on mis-information and myth-information. The underlying assumption of the salt reduction advice is that eating too much salt is a recent phenomenon brought on by the increased consumption of processed foods. Dahl, for example, claimed in his writings that widespread use of salt as a condiment was uncommon until modern times.Data from military archives going back to the war of 1812 show that soldiers and presumable the rest of Western society ate between 16 and 20 grams of salt per day. During the war of 1812, soldiers maintained a daily consumption of 18g\/ day despite high cost. American prisoners of war complained bitterly that their 9 g\/day of salt was \u2018scanty and meager\u2019. It was only after World War II, when refrigeration replaced salting as the primary means of preserving food that Americans lowered their average salt intake to 9g\/ day where it has remained since. During that period pre-WWII, there was no concern of excess deaths from heart disease, stroke or kidney disease \u2014 the main things used to scare us into lowering our salt intake.The Tides TurnFrom its very inception, there were problems with the hypothesis that lowering salt could save lives. Dahl failed to notice all the various high-salt eating cultures that had no adverse health consequences. The Samburu warriors, consume close to two teaspoons of salt per day even going as far as eating salt directly from the salt licks meant for their cattle. Despite eating all this salt, the average blood pressure is just 106\/72 mmHg and does not rise with age. In comparison, about one-third of the adult population in America is hypertensive with a blood pressure of at least 140\/90 mmHg or higher. For reference, a normal blood pressure is less than 120\/80 mmHg and generally rises with age in the United States.Villagers from Kotyang, Nepal, eat two teaspoons of salt per day, and the Kuna Indians eat one and a half teaspoons of salt per day, with no hypertension words, clearly contradicting Dahl\u2019s hypothesis that a high-salt diet causes hypertension.The most recent survey of global salt intake shows that no area of the world conformed to either the AHA or the WHO recommendations for salt restriction. The central Asian region had the highest salt intake, followed closely by high income Asia Pacific region including Japan and Singapore. The Japanese diet is notoriously high in sodium with copious use of soy sauce, miso and pickled vegetables. The Japanese themselves seem to suffer no ill effect as they have the world\u2019s longest life expectancy at 83.7 years. Singapore is third in life expectancy at 83.1 years. If eating salt was really so bad for health, how could the world\u2019s longest lived people also eat one of the world\u2019s saltiest diets?The concerns of a low salt diet started in 1973, when an analysis found six where the average blood pressure was low despite a high-salt diet. For example, the Okayuma, consumed more salt than most nations today (up to 3 1\/3 tsp per day), and yet had some of the lowest average blood pressures in the world.In some cases, blood pressure actually decreased as salt intake increased. For example, North Indians consumed an,average salt intake of 2 \u00bd tsp per day (14 grams) or but maintained a normal blood pressure of 133\/81 mmHg. In South India, average salt intake was about half that of North India, but the average blood pressure was significantly higher at 141\/88 mmHg.But there was still the question of the massive INTERSALT study. Further analysis of the data began to paint a significantly different picture of salt. Four primitive populations (the Yanomamo, Xingu, the Papua New Guinean, and the Kenyan) had been included in the initial analysis, which had significantly lower sodium intakes than the rest of the world. They lived a vastly different, primitive lifestyle from the others, and one had a sodium intake 99% lower than the rest. These outliers had limited generalizability to the rest of the world and because they were such outliers, had an outsized effect on the averages.These 4 primitive societies differed from modern ones in far more than just diet. For example, the Yanomamo Indians of Brazil still live traditionally, hunting and gathering just as they had done centuries ago. They practice endocannibalism, where the ashes of loved ones are consumed because they believe it keeps them alive. There is no processed foods. There is no modern medicine. Comparing this tribe living in the forests of the Amazon to a modern American in the forests of New York is hardly fair. Isolating a single component of their diet, sodium and proclaiming it to be solely responsible for high blood pressure is the height of bad research. It is no different than concluding that wearing loincloths lowers your blood pressure.There were other issues, too. Two populations (Yanomamo and Xingu Indians), when studied further, had the near absence of a specific gene D\/D of the angiotensin converting enzyme, which put these populations at extremely low risk of heart disease and hypertension. Thus, low sodium intake may not be the major or even minor contributor to low blood pressure in these groups.In this case, more information can be gained by removing these outliers from the study populations and seeing if the original salt hypothesis holds true. When those four primitive populations were removed and forty-eight Westernized populations were left in the study, the results were completely opposite the original findings. Blood pressure actually decreased as salt intake increased. Eating less salt was not healthy, it was harmful.The evidence from the United States was not encouraging either. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) are large scale surveys of American dietary habits carried out periodically. The first survey found that those eating the least salt died at a rate 18% higher than those eating the most salt. This was a highly significant, and disturbing result.The second NHANES survey confirmed that a low salt diet was associated with a staggering 15.4% increased risk of death. Other trials found an increased risk of heart attacks of eating a low salt diet in treated hypertensive patients. Those were precisely the patients doctors had been recommending a low salt diet!In 2003, worried, the Center for Disease Control, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to take a fresh look at the available evidence focusing not on blood pressure, but mortality and heart diseaseAfter an exhaustive search of the medical literature, the IOM made several major conclusions. Although low salt diets could lower blood pressure, \u201cExisting evidence, however, does not support either a positive or negative effect of lowering sodium intake to <2300 mg\/d in terms of cardiovascular risk or mortality in the general population.\u201d. That is, lowering the salt intake did not reduce risk of heart attack or death.However, in heart failure, \u201cThe committee concluded that there is sufficient evidence to suggest a negative effect of low sodium intakes\u201d. Oh my. The very patients we were most strenuously recommending to reduce their salt would be harmed the most.But dogma is hard to change. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines continues to recommend reducing sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg of sodium (about one teaspoon of salt) per day with a recommendation of no more than 1,500 mg of sodium (about two-thirds of a teaspoon of salt) per day in hypertensives, blacks, and middle-aged and older adults.Why is salt restriction dangerous?Salt is crucial to maintain an adequate blood volume and blood pressure ensuring that our tissues are perfused with the oxygen carrying blood and nutrients. Salt is composed of equal parts sodium and chloride. When we measure the electrolytes in the blood, salt (sodium and chloride) are by far and away the most common ions. For example, normal blood will contain sodium at a concentration of approximately 140 mmol\/L, and chloride at 100 mmol\/L, compared to potassium at 4 mmol\/L and calcium at 2.2 mmol\/L. No wonder we need salt so badly.There is speculation as to the evolutionary reasons why our blood evolved to be mostly salt. Some believe that we evolved from single celled organisms in the ancient seas of the Earth. As we developed multicellularity and moved onto land, we needed to carry some of the ocean with us as \u2018salt water\u2019 inside our veins and hence salt comprises the vast majority of the electrolytes of the blood. Salt is vital, not a villain.Written byWritten by","8875":"A year ago, my husband and I embarked on a new and exciting adventure with food. We dropped meat and dairy from our diets in an attempt to become as healthy as we could.Saying it like this makes it sound like it was some big leap of a decision that we made overnight. But for a year before that, we were already dropping foods from our diets and researching how to eat healthy. Because despite there being a thousand weight loss and exercise programs out there, it seems to me that very very few of us really know what eating healthy means.I struggled with my weight and my health for most of my life. I would always claim, \u201cI eat pretty healthy,\u201d or admit that I just needed to exercise more. By even when I did \u201ceat healthy,\u201d I didn\u2019t see real results. And I sure as heck didn\u2019t feel great. I mostly lost weight from extremely stressful times when I could barely eat anything at all. Or from illness. Even the year of my life that I ran 20\u201325 miles a week didn\u2019t help me get the results I was looking for. Weight loss and \u201cbeing healthy\u201d always seemed to be some big secret that I wasn\u2019t privy to.My husband struggled with obesity most of his life as well. After becoming ill and finding out he had diabetes, he lost a lot of weight thanks to a strict regime of egg white omelettes, white meat chicken, very low calorie counts and grueling daily workouts with a trainer. His diabetes became at least decent and his blood pressure became manageable. He still required cholesterol meds. But a bland diet of only a handful of foods and a strict, intensive exercise program rarely lasts long for even the most strong-willed among us. And once kids and family commitments came along, exercising for hours each day became impossible. And eating habits reverted back to foods that were quick and readily available. Of course, the weight came back on.This was where we were about two years ago. At the same time, I was unable to lose the weight I\u2019d gained being pregnant and nursing our daughter, Lincoln. I was having lots of stomach problems, allergy problems, hormonal imbalances, sleeping problems, breathing issues, joint and muscle pain and mood swings. My husband needed to go back on all his meds and was having his own fair share of medical scares. We both had parents who got seriously ill and died young, and we knew we were heading in the same direction. But where do you even start? Especially if you\u2019ve already tried it all.This is why I often say that this has been a journey. It wasn\u2019t one big change but a series of them. For us, it started with eliminating red meat, and then trying to get rid of more processed foods. Then it became clear that my body couldn\u2019t handle gluten so we dropped that. We food journaled. We researched. We whittled away at our diets, trying to eliminate all foods that didn\u2019t serve us. The true goal was not to be thin. The goal was health and wellness. The goal was to NOT die young.We saw some successes that year. We improved but also knew there was more work to do and that we needed help. So we started to watch documentaries and read books, keeping an open mind and enlisting critical thinking and logic. We specifically wanted to know how the healthiest people on earth eat.This is when Forks Over Knives and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn came in and changed our lives. This is when we found the answers we\u2019d been seeking forever. And this is when we made the most difficult jump and stopped looking back. One year ago. I\u2019m so very very thankful for that day.Without ever being hungry, we both lost weight and immediately began to feel so much better. Without having to eat bland boring diets (or dangerous fad diets) we both got thinner than we\u2019ve ever been. And unlike all the other times in our lives that we\u2019d lost weight, we did all of this without exercise. And without ever feeling deprived or bored or hungry, because we eat a huge variety of nutrient-rich and filling foods. Real foods. Fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils. Whole foods.Unlike so many fad diets out there, this way of eating and living drastically improved not just how we look but also how we feel. And most importantly, it improved our actual health. Our cholesterol and blood pressure numbers are better than your average 10 year old. Better than either or us have ever been on record in our lives. This is quite the accomplishment at 44 and 49 years old. Without meds or anything except plants as fuel, we have turned back the clocks in our arteries and our immune systems. Like some magical fountain of youth, made out of bananas and lentil soups.The most common comment I get is, \u201cBut I could never eat that way! I couldn\u2019t give up cheese\/burgers\/pizza\/donuts.\u201d But I am not some superhero and neither is my husband. We have no magical powers. We ate the standard American diet for most of our lives and we were just as addicted to it as the rest of America. We feel no superiority or self-righteousness because we\u2019ve had all the same struggles and battles with food as most people do.We wouldn\u2019t be able to eat this way (for a whole year now, without exception) if it wasn\u2019t satisfying and incredibly tasty. The biggest challenge was some patience with the learning curve of looking at food in a new way. It took a willingness to give it a little time, as well as an open mind to the possibility of a better life.I often say that I wouldn\u2019t go back to the standard American diet if you paid me millions. And I mean it. My allergies are gone. My stomach problems are gone. My joint pain and muscle aches and stiffness are gone. My body feels better than it did in childhood. And more than anything, the fear and dread of dying young like our parents has left the forefront of our worries.We can\u2019t protect ourselves against all of the pitfalls in this fragile life, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t look both ways and learn to cross the street safely. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t buckle up when we get into our minivans. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t learn to eat for our health.My mom had a heart attack just before she turned 54. It almost killed her, and I watched her (and cared for her) through another dozen years of health crisis after crisis. I think of this whenever I\u2019m told my diet is \u201ccrazy.\u201d As well as this quote from a doctor I\u2019ve come to think of as a mentor.\u201cSome people think a plant-based diet, whole foods diet is extreme. Half a million people a year will have their chests opened up and a vein taken from their leg and sewn onto their coronary artery. Some people would call that extreme.\u201d-Dr. Caldwell EsselstynWhat I know most certainly of all is that if my husband and I can navigate and learn this lifestyle, so can you.Written byWritten by","8890":"The first journal I owned dates from when I could first write down a whole sentence. In that journal are little ramblings about my pet guinea pig, my parents, and doodles of things that make no sense at all. My journals have changed a lot as I have grown up, moved cities a half dozen times, and chronicled all my ups and downs in love. I\u2019ve written through family dramas, mundane morning routines, bizarre dreams and moments of pure elation. My journal, while not a thing I have used every single day, has been a fixture over the last 20 years. It is where I go to explore my thoughts and feelings, to release and hone my creativity. It has been my most reliable therapist, audience and guide. From humble origins, my obsession with the written word has seen me through.Keeping a journal can:I want to note here that I have always kept an \u2018old-school\u2019 paper and pen style journal \u2014 I\u2019ve never found that keeping a Word doc or an app for this purpose to be quite the same. If you\u2019re as geek about stationery as I am and like this sort of thing, here are my tools of choice right now:Past journals included bright pink hard-covered notebooks with thick ruled lines (Shh, I was thirteen!), as well as a journal that locked, which I covered with purple fabric\u2026. The tools have evolved with time. I went through a phase of exclusively black Moleskines, switched to Leuchtturm1917, and have now settled on this combo (for the moment).And now, here are a few of the \u2018how to\u2019s I\u2019ve developed over the years that have helped:This is contrary to lots of people who are \u2018serious\u2019 proponents of the journal \u2014 they will tell you that you need to write every day, that this is a discipline to acquire in order to really benefit from the habit. I disagree. I have found that my journal has served me best as a quiet bystander, something to which I turn and acknowledge only when really needed.There have been stretches where I have journaled daily. There have been months where I\u2019ve hardly written a word. But applying guilt to whether or not I have written isn\u2019t the purpose of my journal \u2014 it\u2019s not there to serve as another stick to beat myself with. It\u2019s there to be the passive \u2018listener\u2019, the place where thoughts go to be hashed out or simply released. This is why I\u2019ve managed to journal for 20-odd years \u2014 it\u2019s never been a burden, it\u2019s never been a chore. It\u2019s just a way of gently working through things that can\u2019t remain tucked up in my head.So write when the mood strikes \u2014 it might be something you want to set a time for, you might prefer to make it an everyday habit, but it can also be like that therapist you see once a week, or once a fortnight. The point is that it isn\u2019t about forcing words to hit the page. It\u2019s a way to offload and works precisely because it\u2019s guilt-free.Often the first few pages of a new journal of mine will contain something of a manifesto \u2014 an outline, a set of ideas, about what I hope to achieve by journaling, or in the next months\/year of using that particular book. But I try not to plan too harshly what will and what will not make it into the journal. It\u2019s a space where I can throw down any random ideas, uninhibited.The idea of \u2018Morning Pages\u2019 from the classic Artist\u2019s Way asks you to write three pages of anything at all, every day. Three pages is a lot when it\u2019s just word vomit, but the idea remains a classic for a good reason. When I write in my journal, the first priority is to just say whatever it is that\u2019s turning over in my mind at that moment. This means that my journals are not necessarily about keeping track of what I\u2019ve done in a day; they regularly leave things out. It\u2019s much more about what I\u2019ve been thinking about, and if it does cover things that happened, it\u2019s more about how those things made me feel.The intention is to capture things I want to work towards too, but in a way that feels more like releasing the information onto the page and trying to make sense of it, rather than creating schedules or rules. I don\u2019t plan because I\u2019m more interested in whatever the mind will deliver in a given moment. This approach has helped ensure my journals are helpful for working through blocked emotions, and releasing the past.It\u2019s not an accident that my journals tend to be quite aesthetic. I carefully choose the book itself, a result of having tried and tested all shapes, paper weights, sizes, line weights\u2026 Okay, I get really into stationery. But if I make sure the journal is to my liking, if I add touches that make it \u2018mine\u2019, I\u2019m far more likely to use it. I do my best to fill each page with the kinds of things I will look back on fondly, whether they are \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019 or neither. It is an aesthetic collection of polaroids, notes and paraphernalia from wherever I\u2019ve been.This means I don\u2019t scribble. I set up nice pages of words, I draw pictures, I stick things in. You might find you need to attack the surface with your pen for the sake of emotional release, and all power to you. As long as it serves your need, the journal is doing its job. I do like to look back on moments where the handwriting got a little more out of control and think, \u201cWhat was I feeling in that moment?\u201d I collect up the bits of ephemera of my life and stick them in because I like to look back and feel what has changed \u2014 sometimes that requires a few physical touches. I work to create a varied, interesting-to-look-at object which holds my respect as the place I return to to work through all the stuff of life.I have been horrified by some of the things I\u2019ve written in journals. I have looked back and thought, \u201cI really should burn this.\u201d But I\u2019m always glad I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m doing my best to allow the words to come without filtering. And that also means that once they\u2019re out, they stay out. I don\u2019t try to take them back. Sure, they get ugly sometimes, but that doesn\u2019t make me an awful person. It means that at the time, I couldn\u2019t think of anything better to say. And that\u2019s fine. They went into my journal, not out at another person. I look back and try to empathise with my mindset in that moment, and practice a kind of forgiveness that is really tough \u2014 the one we must practice on ourselves.Practising self-compassion and working through self-criticism is already challenging throughout everyday life, particularly if you\u2019ve got a loud internal narrative filled with negative talk. But journaling has offered me a safe space to detach from those thoughts, from that narrative \u2014 it\u2019s on the page, so it\u2019s further away from being an inherent part of my mind. I do my best to write whatever it is that comes as it comes, though this has taken practice. Being a \u2018writer\u2019, I am always assessing and reassessing the way I use language. My journal, however, is a designated peace zone. I vow each time I write to forgive myself for whatever comes out. It doesn\u2019t reflect everything about me as a person \u2014 I am a lot more dynamic than my journal.Ultimately, a journal is a tool. The way you use this tool can help with so many aspects of life, and for me it has added cohesion and ease to the way I work through problems \u2014 this is huge. It\u2019s a loose kind of habit, but one I am very unlikely to give up. Every day is an opportunity to observe, record, reflect and release the things that catch my attention in a natural way. As a result, I observe more, I record more deeply, I reflect more widely and release negativity more often. You don\u2019t need a fancy notebook, or a particular pen \u2014 but if it helps, it helps. The benefits go way beyond the words themselves.Time to get writing\u2026Written byWritten by","8947":"In the world of \u201cthings that we wish were true\u201d, where unicorns frolic with antelopes and the globe is not warming towards an inevitable disaster, there is one thing that just keeps coming up.We really, deeply want wine and chocolate to be healthy, everyday foods. Despite everything we know about nutrition. Despite everything we\u2019ve learned about the human body, and alcohol.I can see why: they are delicious. Wouldn\u2019t it be so great if they were good for us too?Recently, the world has been shaken by a study that media organisations say proves that these unhealthy foods are, in fact, good for your health. \u201cWine and Chocolate Can Help You Live Longer\u201d, said the New York Post, while Yahoo! went with the even better headline: \u201cScience says drinking wine and beer and eating chocolate could help you live longer\u201d.I mean, if science says that they could help you live longer, it\u2019s gotta be true.Sadly, these headlines are wrong.Wine and chocolate are delicious, but remain steadfastly bad for your health.The new study that everyone is talking about was a large epidemiological study looking at how anti-inflammatory food eating might impact people\u2019s risk of death from cancer or heart disease. It was quite an interesting piece of work, particularly because the researchers looked specifically at smoking and how these foods might impact smokers\u2019 risks.The study was extremely big \u2014 the researchers looked at over 60,000 people over a long period of time, collecting a total of more than 1 million person-years* worth of data. All of these people answered a food-frequency questionnaire, from which the researchers calculated a score called an Anti-Inflammatory Diet Index.Overall, it appeared that people who ate diets high in anti-inflammatory foods \u2014 and low in pro-inflammatory foods \u2014 were less likely to die from either cancer or heart disease.Which brings us to the first enormous problem: what are anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory foods?Here is the list of food intakes that the researchers included in their calculation of anti-inflammatory diet:Fruits and vegetables, wholegrain bread, breakfast cereal, unprocessed meat, processed meat, teas, coffee, soft drinks, low-fat cheese, offal, chips, chocolate, nuts, wine, beer.(The bolded categories were pro-inflammatory, normal text was anti-inflammatory.)It\u2019s easy to see that all of the headlines were just boringly wrong. This was not a study on wine, or chocolate, or even anti-inflammatory foods. This study looked at whether diets that were anti-inflammatory as a whole had an impact on health.Sadly, that\u2019s not the only issue here.The media stories all reported the relative risk difference between the group that had the worst diet against the group that had the best: people who had a higher anti-inflammatory score were 18% less likely to die for any reason.However, relative risk is not always very useful. I\u2019ve written about this before: if an event is uncommon, like death, then relative risk can be very misleading. This is because relative risk is the ratio of one risk to another \u2014 if something happens 0.003% of the time, and the relative risk is 300%, it\u2019ll only happen 0.009% of the time instead. This can be important to the population, but rarely to the individual.In this study, the relative risk worked out to 82% \u2014 i.e. 18% less likely. However, if you crunch the numbers, the absolute risk difference was much lower, about 0.01%. So while you could say that people who had higher anti-inflammatory scores were 18% less likely to die, you could also say that their absolute risk only decreased by 0.01%.Not very impressive after all.There were other issues with the media\u2019s interpretation of the study. This research was observational, so it\u2019s hard to tell whether the lower rate of death in the high anti-inflammatory group was caused by the food or some other factor (for example, those people being wealthier). The study also didn\u2019t take into account supplementation, which is considered to be an important component of anti-inflammatory food intake and may have confounded the results. The population that the researchers looked at were mostly Swedish people over the age of 55, making the results hard to generalize to people not in that age\/ethnic group. The differences that everyone reported were also between the highest and lowest groups \u2014 eating just a little more anti-inflammatory\/less pro-inflammatory foods might make much less difference to health.Which anyone who had bothered to read the study could\u2019ve told you.Ultimately, these results mean very little to the individual. Not only did this study find only a tiny risk difference, anti-inflammatory dietary advice is mostly just commonsense recommendations: eat less processed meat, more vegetables, more wholegrains, and cut back on highly-processed foods. Chocolate and wine are, on the whole, a bit tangential to the story.It turns out that large epidemiological trials, while fascinating to people like me, are almost entirely useless to the average person.If you are looking at 20 million people, a risk difference of 0.01% means quite a lot of deaths, but for most individuals that\u2019s a completely meaningless risk. If you\u2019re interested in improving your diet, go and see a dietitian. If you are worried about inflammation, talk to a doctor.Just don\u2019t read epidemiological studies. And definitely don\u2019t listen to the headlines.They are probably wrong about what\u2019s best for you.*Note: a person year is essentially one year of study participation by one person. So, if you have 10 people who stay in the study for 5 years each, you have 50 person-years.Written byWritten by","8982":"There\u2019s a recent bestseller with the wonderfully evocative title \u2018UnF*** yourself\u2019, which is quite beautiful in its simplicity and message. That is, we have so many things that we already know that f*** us up, yet we persist in doing them. In Type 2 diabetes (T2D), it\u2019s worthwhile knowing how we mess ourselves up, so that we may avoid it. Unfortunately, in this case, listening to advice from national diabetes associates such as the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) is not likely to help you, and most likely to harm. Let me explain.Here\u2019s some simple incontrovertible facts on which just about nobody disagrees.Aha! So, the conclusion seems rather pedantic and logical. If eating flour and sugar raise blood glucose and my glucose is already too high, then I should eat less flour and sugar. Also, seemingly so self-evident that I hesitate to even point it out, if eating flour and sugar makes me gain weight, and I weigh too much already, then I should eat less. Super, super obvious, right? Well, not to the CDA and ADA who have been busy exhorting a generation of type 2 diabetes to eat MORE flour and sugar.So, I\u2019m in the public library, and I decide to check out what the CDA feels is a perfectly acceptable dessert \u2014 oh, yes, Canada\u2019s 150 Best Diabetes Desserts \u2014 from the CDA. I randomly look at a recipe \u2014 oh, look \u2014 Lemon Lime Cookies. Scanning through the ingredients, there are 3 1\/2 cups of highly refined white flour and 1 1\/4 cups of sugar. This is one of Canada\u2019s 150 Best Diabetes Desserts? Are these people completely and utterly insane? Yes, yes they are. This is the best advice from the Canadian Diabetes Association? Is the CDA trying to prevent diabetes or give us diabetes, because it is not entirely clear to me.If the CDA is trying to prevent diabetes, then yes, these people must be utterly loco. They\u2019re either stupid or crazy. All that sugar and flour is going to raise blood glucose more than 99% of other foods. Any fool can see that this is bad, not good. How can this possibly qualify as one of the CDAs best desserts?But what about the American Diabetes Association? So, I pick up a book from the ADA \u2014 Ah \u2014 here we go \u2014 Diabetes Meal Planning Made Easy. Let\u2019s see what they tell us about sugar and sweets.\u201cPeople with diabetes no longer have to avoid sugar and sweets\u201d WTF? Are these people completely and criminally insane? Yes, yes, they are. Is the ADA trying to prevent type 2 diabetes, or give us diabetes, because it\u2019s not really clear to me. It is pretty obvious to anybody with an IQ above \u2018imbecile\u2019 that eating sugar is NOT good for type 2 diabetics. Yet here is the ADA telling everybody who wants to listen that diabetics don\u2019t need to avoid sugar, and have been saying that since 1994! Eat more sugar \u2014 it\u2019s good for you! Thanks, ADA!Let\u2019s see what else the ADA tells us. Oh, right \u2014 carbohydrates, which are chemically composed of chains of glucose, are our bodies preferred source of energy and type 2 diabetics should eat about 1\/2 of their calories from carbs. Let\u2019s think about this. In T2D, there is too much glucose in the blood, so we should preferentially choose foods that are composed primarily of glucose. OMFG! Are these people completely and certifiably insane? Yes, yes they are. And look here \u2014 it is OK to eat up to 25% added sugars in our diet! Holy mother of \u2026.This is exactly what we should NOT be doing, and anybody with more than 2 brain cells connected by a spirochete (a reference to neuro-syphilis) should recognize that eating more sugar and grains will make blood glucose WORSE, not better.Here\u2019s more delicious recipes from the ADA. Oh, cheesecake, with graham crackers, stevia and sugar. Wow. Just wow. This is acceptable? This is what the ADA recommends? Again, is this to prevent T2D, or give us T2D?So, if you would really like to unf*** yourself with regards to type 2 diabetes, then the first step is to question very carefully what the CDA and ADA are telling you, because they are not your friends. I wonder why the ADA would give such stupid, stupid advice? Well, let\u2019s take a little looky-lou at their \u2018Banting Circle Elite\u2018 group of friends. Oh, a complete list includes \u2014 AstraZenaca, Eli Lilly, Janssen, Merck, Novo-Nordisk and Sanofi. The Canadian Diabetes Association receives lots of money from \u2014 Janssen, Abbott, Sanofi, Novo-Nordisk and AstraZenaca. All drug companies that have a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to make the most money possible off the backs of \u2014 type 2 diabetics! Lucky for them, not so lucky for you if you choose to f*** yourself by listening to the diabetes associations.What\u2019s the better solution? As I covered in my book, The Diabetes Code, it\u2019s really very simple. Type 2 diabetes is a reversible disease. We\u2019ve proven that over and over again, but you can prove it to yourself. If a friend is diagnosed with T2D, then proceeds to lose 50 pounds, what do you think happens to that T2D? It pretty much disappears. Tom Watson, (above) deputy leader of Britain\u2019s Labour party figured that out himself, and now is committed to tackling the disease throughout the UK, and indeed the world. But why did he need to figure this out himself, DESPITE the health care professionals, not BECAUSE of the health care professionals. If it is reversible, why do so few people reverse it by listening to the ADA? Oh, right, the ADA is trying to give you diabetes, not prevent it.Let\u2019s put together some fun, incontrovertible facts.So, here\u2019s a solution that is free, available to anybody in the world, that is 100% natural, and saves people time. There is no need for more medications or surgery. Fasting is literally the oldest dietary intervention in the world, having been used for millennia.Here\u2019s the bottom line to unf*** yourself from type 2 diabetes, which contributes to heart attacks, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, amputations, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This is a reversible dietary disease, so you need to use a dietary solution \u2014 one that happens to be free, available and simple (although not easy). You can cure this disease with KNOWLEDGE, not drugs, and anybody peddling drugs to you (Canadian Diabetes Association, American Diabetes Association) is not to be trusted. Trust yourself. Arm yourself with knowledge. UnF*** yourself.Written byWritten by","9114":"I grew up in Toronto, Canada in the early 1970s. My younger self would have been utterly shocked that today, obesity has become a rising, unstoppable global phenomenon. At that time, there were serious Malthusian fears that the world\u2019s population would soon eclipse the world\u2019s food production and we would face mass starvation. The major environmental concern was global coolingdue to the reflection of sunlight off dust particles in the air triggering the dawn of a new Ice Age. I wonder if Time Magazine thought one of the 51 things we should do is to become a penguin\u2026Instead, some 50 years later, we find ourselves facing exactly the opposite problems. Global cooling has long ceased to be a serious concern, but global warming and melting polar ice caps dominate the news. Instead of global hunger and mass starvation, we face an obesity epidemic, unprecedented in human history.There are many puzzling aspects to this obesity epidemic. First, what caused it? The fact that this epidemic is both global and relatively recent argues against an underlying genetic defect. Exercise as a leisure activity was largely unheard of in the 1970s. People just didn\u2019t sweat with the oldies in that decade. The proliferation of gyms, running clubs, exercise studios and the like were a product of the 1980s. I would struggle with this question for many years. People ate white bread, ice cream and Oreo cookies in the 1970s. Whole wheat pasta and bread didn\u2019t truly exist as foods real people ate. They were doing everything \u2018wrong\u2019 but yet there\u2019s little obesity, as you can easily see if you were to look at old photographs from the 1970s.Second, why were we powerless to stop this epidemic? Nobody wantedto be fat. All the best scientists, doctors and dieticians of the era were giving dietary advice to stay lean. For more than thirty years, doctors have recommended a low-fat, calorie-reduced diet as the treatment of choice for obesity. Yet the obesity epidemic accelerated. From 1985 to 2011, the prevalence of obesity in Canada has tripled, from 6 percent to 18 percent.1All the available evidence shows that people were trying to cut their calories, cut their fat and exercise more. But they weren\u2019t losing weight. The only logical answer is that we didn\u2019t understand the problem. Eating too much fat and too many calories wasn\u2019t the problem, so cutting the fat and calories was not the solution. So, it all comes back to that first essential question. What causes weight gain?In the 1990s, I graduated from the University of Toronto and the University of California, Los Angeles as a physician and kidney specialist. And I must confess that I did not have the slightest interest in the treatment of obesity. Not during medical school, residency, specialty training or even during practice. But it wasn\u2019t just me. This was true for just about every physician trained in North America. Medical school taught us virtually nothing about nutrition, and even less about the treatment of obesity. There were hours and hours of lectures dedicated to the proper medications and surgery to prescribe. I was proficient in the use of hundreds of medications. I was proficient in the use of dialysis. I knew all about surgical treatments and indications. But I knew nothing about nutrition and even less about how to lose weight. This is despite the fact that the obesity epidemic was well established, and the epidemic of type 2 diabetes was following just behind, with all its health implications. Doctors just didn\u2019t care about diet.Weight loss was not a matter of looking good in a bikini for the summer swimming season. If only. The excess weight was largely responsible for development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, dramatically increasing the risk of heart attacks, stroke, cancer, kidney disease, blindness, amputations, and nerve damage, among other problems. This was not some peripheral topic of medicine. Obesity was at the very heart of everything, and I knew just about nothing.I entered practice as a kidney specialist in early 2000s, and the most common cause of kidney failure, by far, was type 2 diabetes. I treated those patients exactly as I had been trained, the only way I knew how. With drugs like insulin and procedures like dialysis.From experience, I knew that insulin would cause weight gain. Actually, everybody knew insulin caused weight gain. Patients were rightly concerned. \u201cDoctor,\u201d they say, \u201cyou\u2019ve always told me to lose weight. But the insulin you gave me makes me gain so much weight. How is this helpful?\u201d For a long time, I didn\u2019t have a good answer for them, because the truth was it wasn\u2019t helpful.The problem was that my patients were just not getting healthier. I was simply holding their hand as they got worse and worse. I was doing everything I was taught, but it wasn\u2019t doing any good. Gradually, it dawned on me what the problem was.The root cause of the entire problem was the weight. Obesity caused metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, which caused all the other problems. Yet everything I was taught, almost the entire system of modern medicine, with its pharmacopeia, with its nanotechnology, with all the genetic wizardry was focused myopically on the problems at the end.Nobody was treating the root cause. If you treat the kidney disease, patients are still left with obesity, type 2 diabetes and every other complication. This was the way that I, and virtually every other doctor was trained to practice medicine. But it was not working. We needed to treat obesity.We were trying to treat the problems caused by obesity rather than obesity itself.When people lost weight their type 2 diabetes would also reverse course. Treating the root cause is the only logical solution. If your car is leaking oil, the solution is not to buy more oil and mops to clean the spilled oil. The logical solution is to find the leak and fix it. As a medical profession, we were guilty of blindly ignoring the leak.If you could treat the obesity at the beginning, then type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome could not develop. You could NOT develop diabetic kidney disease if you didn\u2019t have diabetes. You couldn\u2019t develop diabetic nerve damage if you didn\u2019t\u2019 have diabetes. It seems obvious in retrospect.The problem was that I didn\u2019t know how to treat the obesity. Despite having worked more than twenty years in medicine, I found that my own nutritional knowledge was rudimentary, at best. This sparked a decade long odyssey and eventually led me to establish the Intensive Dietary Management (IDM) program and the Toronto Metabolic Clinic.In thinking seriously about the treatment of obesity, there was one singularly important question to understand. What causes weight gain? What is the root cause? The reason we never think about this crucial question is that we already think we know the answer. We think that eating too many calories causes obesity. If this were true, then the solution to weight loss is simple. Eat fewer calories.But we\u2019ve done that already. Ad nauseam. For the last 50 years, the only weight loss ever given out was to cut your calories and exercise more. This is the highly ineffective strategy called \u2018Eat Less, Move More\u2019. We\u2019ve added calorie counts to food labels. We have calorie counting books. We have calorie counting apps. We have calorie counters on our exercise machines. We\u2019ve done everything humanly possible to count calories so that we could cut them. Did it work? Did those pounds melt like a snowman in July? No. It sure sounds like it should work. But the empiric evidence, plain as a mole on the tip of your nose, is that it does notwork.From a human physiology standpoint, the entire calorie story collapses like a house of cards. The body does not measure calories because it has no calorie sensors. The body does not respond to \u2018calories\u2019. There are no calorie receptors on cell surfaces. It has no ability to know how many calories you are or are not eating. If your body doesn\u2019t count calories, why should you? Calories is purely a unit of energy borrowed from physics. The field of obesity medicine, desperate for some simple measure of food energy, completely ignored human physiology and turned to physics instead.So, we got the saying \u2018A calorie is a calorie\u2019. But that\u2019s not a question I can recall anybody ever asking. Instead, the question is \u2018Are all calories of food energy equally fattening?\u2019, to which the answer is an emphatic no. One hundred calories of kale salad is not as equally fattening as one hundred calories of candy. One hundred calories of beans is not equally as fattening as one hundred calories of white bread and jam. But for the last 50 years, we pretended they were equally fattening.And so I started from the beginning. Unravelling the rotten tapestry of the Calories model to answer that all-important question of the underlying causes of weight gain was the reason I wrote The Obesity Code. Since then, in my Intensive Dietary Management program (www.IDMprogram.com)has treated thousands of patients over the last 5 years. I\u2019ve wondered sometimes about why such a simple concept about using free dietary measures like fasting to treat dietary diseases runs into such obstacles. Here is the traditional medical system.Here is how the modern medical system fares if people could use diet to control their own health and destiny. Reversing type 2 diabetes, as I explored in The Diabetes Code, is really very simple, and does not involve using expensive medicines or surgeries.Written byWritten by","9138":"We know that smoking is bad for us.Smoking has clearly been proven to cause cancer (and many other diseases), and therefore a health-warning label is required to appear on every pack of cigarettes. It has been that way for over 50 years.Alcohol, too, is a known carcinogen. Alcohol bottles must also bear health-warning labels, and it has become common knowledge that excessive drinking causes health problems.Of course cigarettes and alcohol can only legally be purchased and consumed by adults.But there is another known carcinogen that many people consume every day and feed to their children.In fact, there are over 100 known human carcinogens.But only a few of these are related to diet and lifestyle (most are chemicals in the environment and other exposures).If there was something you were doing every day that was known to cause cancer, wouldn\u2019t you want to know about it?Perhaps, like cigarettes and alcohol, some people would choose to do it anyway.If you knew something caused cancer, would you give it to your kids? Probably not, just like you wouldn\u2019t want to expose them to toxic chemicals.But there is a high probability that you are regularly eating a cancer-causing food, and putting it on your kids\u2019 plates, too.That cancer-causing food is processed meat.The International Agency for Research on Cancer (the cancer agency of the World Health Organization) has classified processed meat as a carcinogen, something that causes cancer. That means that processed meat is a Group 1 carcinogen, in the same class as asbestos and tobacco.Red meat is classified as a probable carcinogen (Group 2A), something that probably causes cancer.Processed meat includes hot dogs, ham, bacon, sausage, and some deli meats. Any meat that has been treated in some way to preserve or flavor it is processed meat (e.g. salting, curing, fermenting, smoking). Red meat includes beef, pork, lamb, and goat.This finding was reached by 22 experts from 10 countries who reviewed more than 800 studies to reach their conclusions.Rock-solid proof.Eating just one hot dog or 4 strips of bacon every day leads to a double-digit increase in colorectal cancer risk, and for red meat there is evidence of increased risk of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer.We are 100% certain that processed meat causes cancer.About 34,000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are attributable to diets high in processed meat.And although eating red meat has not yet been proven to cause cancer, if the reported associations were proven to be causal, diets high in red meat could be responsible for 50,000 cancer deaths per year worldwide.Those numbers don\u2019t even include the other negative health outcomes caused by eating processed and red meat, such as high blood pressure and heart and cardiovascular disease.You may think that bacon is one of the joys of life, and still choose to eat it and serve it to your kids, but you should at least know about the risks.Although these findings are several years old, most people have no idea that processed meat causes cancer. They grew up with hot dogs and cold cuts, and therefore give those foods to their kids as well.Yes, the occasional hot dog or hamburger is probably okay, just like the occasional cigarette or martini won\u2019t kill you.But if the risks of tobacco and alcohol are widely known \u2014 and those products are required to display health warnings \u2014 then processed meat should be held to the same standard.Processed meat is known to cause cancer.Every package of processed meat should display that fact.It is inexcusable that millions of pounds of processed meat are eaten every year (the average American eats nearly 18 pounds of bacon alone per year), and served to our kids, without the health risks being front and center.Perhaps many people would make the same food choices anyway.But I know I\u2019ll think twice before I give my kids another hot dog, and I certainly won\u2019t make a habit of giving them processed and red meat.I wouldn\u2019t encourage my kids to take up smoking, and I won\u2019t steer them into a meat-based diet, either.Written byWritten by","9140":"See, I have a classic diagnosis cocktail: anxiety and depression. The gin martini of mental illnesses. Basic. Available in every corner of the earth.And mine\u2019s not even the full cocktail. Oh no no no. It\u2019s minor. Officially.I can\u2019t relate to feeling suicidal. Even on my very worse days, I\u2019ve never felt the urge to self-harm. My total number of panic attacks remains at zero, my appetite has never plummeted and only briefly blew up, and 99% of the time I can get out of bed just fine, thanks.So, when I read stories involving such dark, horrid symptoms, I wonder if mine even matter. If I should just shut up about them. Me and my \u201cminor\u201d cases.Certainly, I\u2019ve been unable to sleep or relax in the slightest, too anxious about work. OF COURSE, I\u2019ve found myself lying in bed, wearing pajamas, and watching season 3 of The Office all day, followed by Back to the Futures One, Two and Three, while I periodically cry into my cat\u2019s fur.But who hasn\u2019t?!?Are my depression and anxiety real or have the college psychologists, social worker therapists, clinical psychiatrists, and BuzzFeed quizzes who told me \u201cyou have minor depression and generalized anxiety disorder\u201d been lying to me?After all, most people who meet me describe me as \u201cbubbly\u201d, \u201centhusiastic\u201d, and \u201cenergetic.\u201d I\u2019ve been asked if I\u2019m a preschool teacher, former cheerleader, or (twice) a Bar\/Bat Mitzvah party MC.Unless I\u2019m in a therapist office, crying to my mom, or re-re-re-re-rewatching You\u2019ve Got Mail alone at home, I don\u2019t seem like a depressed or anxious person. Not only do I not wear a \u201chi, I\u2019m depressed\u201d t-shirt or romper and carry around a box of tissues, but I don\u2019t publicly showcase even the most intricate of symptoms.I\u2019m a stellar actress. Heck, oftentimes, I don\u2019t even think I\u2019m acting; I am truly happy.Yet, without antidepressants (and occasionally with it), I meet many of the symptoms for good \u2018ol D and A. And the docs say I have \u2018em.So, that makes me feel like an impostor.Usually, it applies to careers; folks with it believe that despite all their accomplishments, they\u2019re frauds. Inadequate. They\u2019re not actually smart, talented, or knowledgeable like everyone seems to think; there\u2019s been a massive mistake.Well, I often lapse into mental health impostor syndrome. (That\u2019s a thing, right?) All those super impressive psychology professionals were wrong, I\u2019ve just accidentally deceived them into declaring me anxious and depressed. I\u2019m not worthy of those titles.I imagine mental illness as a rollercoaster and I\u2019m not tall enough to ride it. And by thinking that I am, I\u2019m taking up someone else\u2019s space. I\u2019m trivializing the experiences of people who have it far worse.What\u2019s given me the gall to publicly out myself as mentally ill and use its relevant hashtags?Perhaps I just think depression is cool and trendy and I want in?Nah.I write about my illnesses because although they\u2019re minor (and generally more socially accepted and understood than say bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, or schizophrenia), they\u2019re still real.They still affect me. They still challenge me. They still hurt me.If I had cancer, but \u201conly\u201d a highly survivable type of breast cancer, not pancreatic, I won\u2019t be expected to shut up to let the spotlight shine on the \u201creal\u201d sick people instead, would I?There\u2019s enough spotlight and internet publishing space for all of us.I\u2019m glad my anxiety isn\u2019t crippling. I\u2019m so, so, so grateful that 50 daily milligrams of Zoloft do the trick to keep most of the symptoms at bay.And my heart breaks for those who have it worse.But I also feel for people with similar symptoms and experiences to my own. I know that even just a sprinkling of anxiety and\/or depression can feel isolating. Suffocating. Debilitating.So, I want other people in the mental illness minor-to-moderate leagues to feel comfortable asking for help. I want them to know that they\u2019re not alone, that their illnesses are still valid. I want them to feel comfortable speaking up and speaking out.I don\u2019t want anyone to hide their mental illness skeletons away just because they don\u2019t seem demonic enough.So, I\u2019m not hiding either.They\u2019re manageable. But they\u2019re real.Relatedly:Written byWritten by","9166":"Have you ever queried yourself? What are your responsibilities, your duties, what you should do and what you shouldn\u2019t and how you actually live.I do not remember when I first asked myself these questions, however, there is no single day that I didn\u2019t think about these questions in the last few years.I have a lot of friends who share my thoughts and maybe there are millions of people around the world like us. I think, getting more conscious of mankind day after day cause this situation.The common feature of most of us is that we continue our daily lives in a normal way after these interrogations. After feeling the little suffering of our souls, we find ourselves in having fun with friends, concentrating on our jobs or we throw ourselves into the arms of our beloved to find some consolation and serenity. Even though the enthusiasm in all of us creates sparks to change this situation, very few of us are able to blaze enough to change somethings.The writings I will put on this platform are one of the efforts made for the spark within me to return to the fire. In this world where all kinds of injustice, inequity, violence, and evil are too much, philosophy of my life is to reach as wide a mass of people as I can, to touch their lives, to improve their life standard as whole or partial, or at least to share their troubles and happinesses as much as possible. Therefore, I would like to share with you my own thoughts about the issues that I think are useful for all of us.So what we are going to talk about in these writings?On my page you can find articles on almost anything that will increase the welfare of people in material or spiritual sense. I will try to convey to you the events that I encounter in daily life. Of course, if I think that \u201cYeah knowing this information can make every people\u2019s life better!\u201d It can be a movie, a book, a video or any events that have made my life better. Even I will talk about the diet and health course that I took the last semester and it would make your life more beautiful if you applied it. As long as it will lead to a nice improvement for us. At the end of 5\u20136 minutes that you spent for reading my article, I want to make a positive development for your life.There are 4 categories that I think I can be useful for you now.Now, you can ask why I\u2019ve been interested in so many different areas. Let me explain\u2026In fact, I never interested in just one area or topics. On the contrary I always think that it is the biggest problem of people. \u201cConcentrating on a single area.\u201d It\u2019s nothing but a waste of our brilliant brain. Especially for me, as an industrial engineer who tries to always increase the efficiency in every part of the life.I believe that the brain can work above average in many different areas. People who want to develop themselves can be very successful in both social and technical fields if they work in a resolutely way. And there are many examples of this. Of course, I\u2019m not saying that simultaneously you can be an expert film critic, a dietitian who is very respectable in the field, and also a mechanical engineer who understands instantly what the problem is when looking at the engine. I would like to emphasize that the studies you will do in different fields can give you different disciplines and improve your perspective.I would like to give a relevant example. Mendel, known as the father of heredity.Some of us recognize Mendel. He has significantly contributed to heredity by pea experiments. So what was Mendel\u2019s profession? Isn\u2019t that one of the first questions that come to our minds? Not! Because most of us already think that he is a biologist if he interested in heredity. Some of us also know he\u2019s a priest. But he was more than we know. He was gardening and beekeeping in the early period of his life. Then he was engaged in sports but had to leave because of his health situation. Then he studied philosophy and physics at Olomouc University, and then he entered the church. He was sent by the Church to Vienna for financial education and returned to the monastery as a teacher, but failed the interview. I want to point out a few important things that he made. His greatest work has been on heredity, which is why we call him \u201cThe Father of Heredity\u201d. Other than that, for bees, he has designed hives. He was also interested in astronomy and meteorology, and founded the Austrian Meteorological Society. You can see how he was active in a variety of branches throughout his life.That\u2019s what I want to do, and partly I can achieve. Improving myself in the field of industrial engineering, playing guitar, reading literary and professional books, to share my thoughts with other people, to do sports to protect my vitality, to watch movies that will add value to me, like the \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d, writing my thoughts about these films to share with others and of course, to spend beautiful time with the beautiful woman who brings back me to life.But this year I decided to make some changes in my daily plans. I hope I can make my plan a permanent part of my life.I want to make a serious contribution to people\u2019s lives. I\u2019m talking about any contribution that I can. But of course, I have priorities of my plans. First of all, I want to help to enrich the libraries of schools \u2014 even establish a library to schools that do not have a library \u2014 and especially fulfilling to students who have difficulties in winter clothing and stationery. Because I want to show that there are also nice things to the new generation who are constantly witnessing injustice and wickedness while fulfilling their needs.Now it\u2019s time to summarize what I want to say.I\u2019m writing my feelings and thoughts because I\u2019m just tired of being a person living inside of himself and I want to activate my enthusiasm inside of me. Rather, I believe that writing as a part of this desire and even as its first step.Hoping a better life!Written byWritten by","9182":"And now, I\u2019ve got your attention. Apologies for using such a shamelessly misleading headline to get you to click, but this type of marketing unfortunately works. I promise my intentions are in the right in place, as my goal is to attract confused readers who are looking for ideas on how to lead a healthier life. If you stick with me, I\u2019m going to try my best to help you without the lies and quick fixes that come with the headline above.One of the reasons I joined the field of nutrition was to prevent chronic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes) and help remove the confusion that surrounds the topic. There is money to be made by desperation and uncertainty. As someone who has navigated through the misleading misinformation, my goal is to simplify and share information that could help improve your health. These changes worked for me, but they might not work for you. Your mileage may vary.And just to clarify, no, there are no tricks to help you lose belly fat incredibly fast. You cannot tell your body to lose fat from specific areas, and lifestyle changes should be life-long approaches not incredibly fast miracle cures.Below are 10 practical concepts that can get you on the right path to improving your health. All of them focus on healthy eating or physical activity. Keep in mind that there are many more aspects to living a healthy life beyond those listed below (i.e., don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t smoke, DON\u2019T SMOKE).This is NOT medical advice, so always connect with your healthcare providers about any substantial behavior changes. If you\u2019re looking specifically for tailored diet advice connect with a registered dietitian.This is simply a list of lessons I wished someone told me when I first attempted to change my habits.1. Don\u2019t set unrealistic weight-loss goals. Focus on behaviors.Weight can be a fickle thing. It can fluctuate by fluid intake, time of day, and the food you consume. So as you begin to take steps to improve your health, please don\u2019t judge your success just by the number on the scale.Do know your weight and follow it over time, but avoid fretting about your weight on a daily basis.No doubt excess weight does increase your risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, especially when it is stored around your waist.But weight is only one factor for health. All too often we judge success by being able to meet some unrealistic weight-loss goal (often a number totally contrived and arbitrarily decided upon). We shoot for this unrealistic weight-loss goal instead of goals around behavior (e.g., eating at least three servings of vegetables per day) or a more moderate goal that would still improve our health.Failure to reach this ideal weight can cause frustration and potentially increase our likelihood of giving up entirely on improving our diet or exercising more.It\u2019s important to understand that weight-loss maintenance, and adherence of long-term habits are what actually make a difference. Anyone can lose weight temporarily through many different approaches, even by eating only Twinkies, McDonald\u2019s or potatoes.As a society, sadly we judge other people on if they\u2019re healthy or not by how they look. When people begin to make changes, at a glance, we cannot see that a person has lowered their blood pressure, improved control of their blood sugar, or eaten three servings of vegetables that day.As Patrick Mustain eloquently put it,\u201cIf we were to shift the conversation towards a culture of health-one that values healthy eating and regular physical activity as ends unto themselves, we may be happily surprised to find that not only are we living longer, happier lives, with less disease and fewer health costs, but also, we may need to drop a collective pant size or two. Or not. Either way, we\u2019re better off.\u201dSet a moderate goal, focus on behaviors, and remember that even a weight loss of 5% has been associated with a reduced risk of many chronic diseases.2. Focus on your overall food patternBefore I begin to talk about nutrition, I want to make the important note that it\u2019s a wicked hard subject to study.We\u2019re still learning as a field. It\u2019s incredibly hard to make a statement with great certainty that eating a specific food will improve or worsen your health, or especially, create a longer life. Context is key for nutrition. It\u2019s an evolving field, and we should embrace its evolution. The field is currently discussing ways to improve it.What we currently know is that eating or not eating a single food will more than likely have a small impact on your health and\/or life span. Almost all longevity claims for a single food should be met with a lot of skepticism (I\u2019m looking at you goji berries).When you look at cultures around the world you will notice that humans can survive on a variety of different foods. There is no one diet to rule them all; however, we\u2019ve learned that once a culture adopts a more Western way of eating and living, chronic diseases are likely to follow, unfortunately. However, this is usually in exchange for a more affordable, convenient, and productive food supply (#tradeoffs).Research has shown that overall food patterns (and other habits like exercising) matter more than just focusing on a single food or nutrient. It\u2019s not perfect, but Dariush Mozaffarian of Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy has developed a simple graphic regarding foods we should be eating more of instead of others.To breakdown his thoughts, let\u2019s just say we have three food groups: eat more of, eat moderately, and eat less of.Current research suggests that our health could potentially be improved if we ate more whole fruits, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, fish\/seafood, whole grains, vegetables, vegetable oils (e.g., extra-virgin olive oil), and yogurt (note: more research is needed!) instead of common sources of \u201ceat less of foods\u201d like chips, sugary cereals, butter, pizza, sugary drinks, cheeseburgers, fries, refined grains (think bagels, pasta), alcohol, processed meats (think deli meats), and other ultra-processed foods.Other foods like cheese, chicken, eggs, and milk are in the \u201ceat moderately group\u201d. They show some benefit but not as much as the eat more food (more research is needed!).The only items that are nutrient specific he recommends to limit are foods high in salt (think Ramen and most frozen meals) and industrial trans fats. Thanks to policy changes most industrial trans fats have been removed from the food supply in the US.You can avoid these two nutrients by looking at the ingredient list and the nutrition facts label (i.e. the box on food packaging that lists fats, sugar, etc.). Check for the words partially hydrogenated in the ingredients and assess the sodium on the label.Unless advised by your health care provider, 2,300 mg (a teaspoon's worth) seems like a helpful target for your daily intake, but it\u2019s a debate that\u2019s highly contentious in the nutrition field (more research is needed!).If you are eating foods in the eat more group, you usually do not have to worry about these last two nutrient specific recommendations since these foods do not have industrial trans fats or large amounts of sodium.You also don\u2019t have to eat all of the foods in the eat more group. You can vary your diet and decide to include specific items for taste, environmental concerns, and cultural preferences.A great place to start is by replacing snacks (think chips, candy) with items like whole fruit and nuts, which don\u2019t require cooking and are convenient.3. Food is more than the calories it containsCalories do matter and in America, we currently do not have a short supply of them.Going off best estimates, daily calorie surpluses of 220 calories for adults and 41 calories each day for youth explains our increasing weight. Weights have actually been increasing since the 1920s, but they\u2019ve increased more rapidly since the 1960s. The obesity prevalence went from 13.3% in the early 1960s to about 39% in 2016.When you\u2019re beginning the process of improving your diet, it\u2019s helpful to gauge the number of calories you are supposed to be eating. I highly recommend checking out the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Body Weight Planner to get an accurate estimate.Some people find it helpful to use a food diary app to track intake and calories too. I personally like Cronometer since it offers a barcode scanner feature to easily capture your food and validated nutrition data. (note: I receive no $ from them).But please don\u2019t just judge a food item only on its calorie content. For example, one avocado has 234 calories compared to only 143 calories in a 12 oz can of Coke. Does this make the soda healthier than an avocado? Of course not. Food companies like to use this line of thinking all the time when they reformulate a product to become \u201chealthier\u201d or \u201clow fat\u201d since the calories are lowered.Like I stated, nutrition science continues to evolve, and we\u2019re learning about the potential importance of the food matrix and the thousands of phytochemicals (i.e. biological active compounds) in plants on chronic disease risks (more research is needed!).So do know how many calories you are consuming, but focus on eating items from the eat more of category instead of simply calories for overall health beyond weight management.4. Create a health haven at homeMake your house a haven for only healthy food for most weeks of the year. This is especially important for families with children. Avoid keeping energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods that make it challenging to stop eating in your house. Especially avoid buying larger portions of them.Food scientists and companies are great at their jobs (for better or worse). They know exactly how to make foods irresistible and as easy as possible to eat.It\u2019s very hard to practice moderation on a food that does not trigger satiety until the package is already gone. Back in the day, Cheetos and Reese\u2019s were a prime example of this for me (let\u2019s be real, I can still easily polish off a bag of them).You can eat unhealthy almost anywhere, so it\u2019s important to make sure your house is a default for healthy eating. The key is to stock the house with healthy foods (think eat more foods) you actually enjoy. Give yourself some time to find these foods. Change takes time.5. Upgrade your beverageWe love our beverages here in America, and I definitely fall into that group.Sugary beverages, in particular, are not helping with our efforts to be healthy. They harm our dental health and offer no benefit besides energy in the form of calories.A smart approach to improve your diet is upgrading your drink. One of the first steps I did to improve my health was limiting sugary drinks. Start drinking more unsweetened beverages like tap water, seltzer water, tea, or coffee.Reduce consumption of items like soda, fruit juices, energy drinks, coffee drinks (think Frappuccino\u2019s), sports drinks, and the often overlook source of calories, alcohol (say it isn\u2019t so!).As someone from Wisconsin (#GoPackGo), I do enjoy beer (my college friends sure can attest to that). However, you should be aware of how many alcoholic beverages you consume for many reasons. It\u2019s an easy source of calories we often overlook. For example, a 12-ounce bottle of Founders Breakfast Stout clocks in at 270 calories.In America, alcohol is one of our top 10 sources of calories for adults. A good rule of thumb is to limit consumption as much as possible, while again not feeling deprived. I usually enjoy it now when I\u2019m with family and at social events.Drinking alcohol can also lead to you to make impulsive unhealthy food choices (again something my college friends can attest to). It acts as an appetite stimulant and impairs your good judgment.I don\u2019t personally drink diet soda, and we still don\u2019t know the long-term health impact of some artificial sweeteners; however, IMO drinking diet options are still a step in the right direction away from full sugar ones. For the most part, claims about diet sodas are overblown.6. Healthy living \u2260 perfectionA sure way to fail at healthy living is to aim for perfection. We rarely expect perfection from other aspects of life so please don\u2019t apply it to eating or working out. You should plan for setbacks from less desirable eating habits and mistakes should be expected.7. Avoid getting too hungryI feel privileged to say this comment, and I know some people do not have the resources to avoid this problem. As a country, we could being doing a lot more to ensure no one goes hungry at a systematic level.But if you\u2019re privileged like me in regards to healthy eating, getting to the point of being hungry can lead to bad decision-making. When you\u2019re hungry it\u2019s a lot more challenging to make a rational decision about food. Especially when you have so many energy-dense, nutrient-poor food prompts and marketing around.Identify time periods that have caused \u201chunger slips\u201d in the past. Plan ahead and pack \u201ceat more food\u201d snacks to ensure rational food decisions.8. Incorporate physical activity into your daily scheduleSimilar to not believing there is one diet to rule them all, I also don\u2019t believe there is the perfect exercise that meets everyone's needs and preferences.The best exercise is the one you enjoy doing and can imagine continuing to do the rest of your life. Remember, any movement is better than sitting on the couch watching Netflix. Physical activity also supports your health no matter your body size.Every day I try to move. I have a handful of exercises I find fun (after trial and error). It improves my mood daily and reduces my stress. Some days it\u2019s a long run or bike ride; other times it\u2019s just a brisk walk with our dog or lifting weights at the gym.If more traditional leisure time exercise is not your thing incorporate physical activity into your daily routine. Try biking, walking, or running to work. Take an \u201cexercise snack\u201d by running up your office stairs, park the furthest spot away when shopping, and try to do as many trips by foot or bike. Move as much as you can and enjoy the benefits.9. Make healthy eating easierJust like with exercise, scratch cooking can be a wonderful activity to do. There are literally millions of healthy recipes for you to choose from online. You can make scratch cooking as easy or as fancy as you would like.If you like to cook and want to make it easier, I highly recommend buying an Instant Pot (note: I have not received $ to promote). It\u2019s been a game-changer for prepping meals for the week and for batch cooking sides like whole grains and beans. Tupperware and meal-prep containers are also helpful resources to have on hand too.Unfortunately, we all have busy lives and sometimes we cannot perform this wonderful act. So please do not feel guilty if you are not able to cook all of your meals. Although they are harder to find, stores and restaurants are beginning to offer healthier choices. Again, emphasize \u201ceat more foods\u201d when you\u2019re dining out. These products are more expensive than doing it yourself, but they will save you time, labor, and make healthy food more convenient.10. Don\u2019t stress about it and enjoy lifeAll people value their health to some degree, and health is one of the top priorities for households.No one hopes to suffer a heart attack, require weekly dialysis as the result of type 2 diabetes, or to be too physically unfit to play with their children and grandchildren. Our current food environment makes it far too easy to \u201cprioritize immediate gratification over potential long-term negative results\u201d; it exploits our biological, psychological, social, and economic vulnerabilities, making it easier for us to eat unhealthy.Although the above guidance focuses on individual change, it would be a lot more productive and beneficial if larger environmental and social changes made healthy eating and physical activity easier, more affordable, equitable, and convenient to do. Most gains in our lifespan have come from working collectively rather than focusing on individual behavior change.IMHO, unhealthy food and inactivity are too often a large part of our everyday life. For a while, our number one source of calories each day came from desserts. We all do bear some personal responsibility for our health, but our surrounding environment can either support or undermine our long-term health goals. The current environment reinforces our preferences and demands for nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods.To help counteract this environment, before you purchase nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods think about the reasons you are doing so. Are you celebrating a particular event? Are you enjoying this treat with loved ones? Are you savoring the treat as you consume it?Or are you just stressed, bored, or being impulsive? Again, it\u2019s fine if these states cause you to eat unhealthy from time to time (we\u2019ve all been there!). No one is perfect.My argument is to make sure a treat is actually a treat. A food you actually want to eat. A sure sign of an impulsive unhealthy food purchase is regret after consuming it. Try to remove the idea of guilt from food.In the end, life is also more than just nutrition and healthy living. Be deliberate with food choices but don\u2019t let it disrupt other much more important aspects of life.The great thing about healthy living is that it can be tailored to your preferences, culture, and everyday reality. If you don\u2019t like kale, you don\u2019t have to eat it. If you enjoy eating healthy all the time and do not feel you are missing out, you can do that too.The idea is to find a lifestyle you actually enjoy sticking to. Not one that banishes your favorite food or forces you to do an exercise you hate. No doubt at first it might be challenging to shift your tastes buds to foods that love you back or find an exercise that is enjoyable. Change takes time. However, food can be both delicious and nutritious. Exercise can be fun and incorporated into your daily life.Written byWritten by","9241":"\u201cDepression\u201d is a really tricky word. As with all things related to mental health, it\u2019s not as well understood as it should be. Health should cover the whole person \u2014 mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually \u2014 but we all know that that is not often what people mean when they talk about \u201chealth\u201d. Non- physical suffering is harder to locate and treat, and gets washed up amongst cultural, social, gender and other factors, such that it remains in many ways opaque.I want to start by saying that this is a deeply personal issue to me and something I care about intrinsically. Ten years ago, I was told that I probably had Major Depression, and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Scary, capital-letter-words. For many people, these titles are really useful \u2014 they legitimise something you feel to be true, but that is hard to place. They can make you feel like \u2018Yes, finally! I\u2019m not just making it up.\u2019 They give substance to thoughts and experiences you struggle to define.In my case, they are labels I have struggled to come to terms with. What does \u201cGeneralised Anxiety Disorder\u201d even mean? They\u2019re a bunch of words that seem to mean it\u2019s okay to treat me like I\u2019m either permanently damaged or volatile (that\u2019s only like 50% true. 60% tops). I have had to carve out ways to deal with something that might never leave me \u2014 strategies and truths all bundled up in the defence of a big dose of the sads. Here are just a few of the things I have learned:Every person\u2019s experience of depression is individual. It may not be a permanent state of affairs, it can come about as a result of an event or circumstance \u2014 this does not make it less painful. Mine sometimes manifests as having a Nobody Will Ever Really Love Me cry, and sometimes it manifests as a Marathon All of Game of Thrones. Sometimes they happen at the same time. While eating my body weight in Chinese food. You just never know. Researchers continue to try to characterise types of depression (according to this article below, I\u2019m in Biotype 4). Regardless of what \u201ctypes\u201d of depression exist, the way I need to deal is likely to be peculiar to me.The point is that if I need to get it all out there by having two lunches, a shot of tequila and a four hour bath, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to do. It\u2019s rarely anything all that bad, and I have learned not to judge myself for doing the random weird combination things that keep me going \u2014 after all, if I don\u2019t do these things to take care of myself, everything gets a hell of a lot worse. Which brings me to the next point\u2026Far be it for me to tell you what to do (see above). But I have found that unless I do everything I can think of, I very quickly end up doing nothing. This is something that came out of a recent discussion with a girlfriend who told me she\u2019d felt suicidal. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to do any more,\u201d she confessed, and this had resulted in a lot more doing nothing at all \u2014 sleeping, skipping work, etc.Of course, it\u2019s easy for me to see, from the outside, that there are a million more things she could be doing to keep momentum up. But I also understand that when you\u2019re in it, options feel very limited. That\u2019s rarely actually true. There\u2019s very rarely no options, such that taking yourself out the gene pool is the solution. As a person who has stared long and hard at the tube tracks, I can say with some confidence that I have always made the right choice on this \u2014 I\u2019ve always found new things to try. I keep track of everything I do try, by writing it down.Whether it\u2019s as simple as ordering a new dish off a familiar menu, or going to a new class, or finally sitting down to meditate for 5 minutes of a morning, there\u2019s always something. And the great thing is that once you do whatever it is, you can immediately congratulate yourself for it. A sense of achievement is priceless when you\u2019re in the pit. Win-win.Let\u2019s face it: depressed people are super hard to be around. They\u2019re sad. They\u2019re often desperate. They can shut down and shut themselves away, be difficult to talk to or do things with. They make life sound super shit, because that\u2019s their reality in that moment. Obviously, there\u2019s always going to be those arsehats who don\u2019t get it and actually make things worse. Who say things like, \u201cYou should be so grateful that I put up with you!\u201d [Note: Actual thing said to me by a possessive ex] or a straight up (and more reasonable), \u201cI don\u2019t want to deal with that.\u201d Those cases are pretty clear cut.Then there are the ones that try. They try to shake you loose, which sometimes won\u2019t work. That\u2019s when even the most diligent friends might start to give up. It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t care about you or love you, they just don\u2019t know how to help and nobody likes to fail at something. Sometimes, this features in my depression as a self-fulfilling cycle. Nobody can possibly love\/like\/understand someone like me, and voil\u00e0! I make it impossible for another human to do those things. I test them. I want to push them, and watch them leave me. Ahah! I then say, I was right all along about you! You crappy friend\/lover\/whatever! Yes, good work brain. You\u2019ve created a self-fulfilling cycle, well done you.I\u2019ve worked hard to develop the awareness of when I\u2019m doing this. I\u2019m trying very hard to stop giving people a reason to go. Some people will leave. But others will stay. The ones that go\u2026 well, it is what it is. The ones that stay? Priceless, wonderful humans, made all the more shiny by their saintly patience. Try not to let the leavers hurt you \u2014 the stayers are out of this world.Depression is a part of my life, but it\u2019s not everything I\u2019m about. The labels at first gave me a good reason to explore, treat and try to change something that I wasn\u2019t coping with well. But after a while, it almost became a kind of challenge \u2014 another thing to overcome. Now I realise that, while it\u2019s there in the background, I\u2019m actually still a pretty cool and diverse person, with lots of other things going on.I would remind others who are struggling that what you are dealing with is real, it\u2019s not a figment of your imagination \u2014 it\u2019s not necessarily the sort of thing you can just \u201charden up\u201d against and get past. It takes work, but it doesn\u2019t diminish you, if you don\u2019t let it. You are still a capable person, with many other aspects to who you are.What are your coping strategies in tough times? Do you find the diagnoses\/labels helpful?Oh, and do you require a combination of food and long baths to soothe you? If so, let\u2019s talk.Written byWritten by","9284":"You\u2019re never too old for toys. A Christmas party taught me that. Our hosts were a married couple about my age \u2014 early 30s, friends of friends. They both had jobs with enviable salaries. A big, three-story house. Actual furniture. They were full fledged adults, I thought.Around 10 pm, the party started to move upstairs. My friend\u2019s husband stayed on his phone, out by the pool. He waved at us. \u201cI\u2019m making a big trade,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be up there in a minute.\u201dIt occurred to me I still didn\u2019t know what her husband did. I asked, \u201cIs he talking about stocks or something?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cAction figures.\u201dThat\u2019s why the party was moving upstairs \u2014 to look at his collection.They\u2019d devoted an entire room to collectible figurines. Multiple shelves. A closet full of boxes. Avengers. Star Wars. Predator. We\u2019re talking hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of toys.Years later, I still don\u2019t know what my friend\u2019s husband does for a living. But I remember the look on his face when he talked about his trades. He was still a kid, and not ashamed by it at all.Nobody judged him, either. They were almost inspired. And so was I, even if I didn\u2019t want to admit it at first.Most of my friends played almost as much as they worked. They spent hours a week on games, toys, and cartoons. No part of their lives suffered. Most of them were married. Some of them had kids.Meanwhile, I still lived in a studio apartment. Unmarried. Living off a graduate stipend.And yet, I felt a lot like an adult. Mainly because I never had \u201cfun\u201d anymore. Sure, my research was exciting. But my job search wasn\u2019t. Neither was dealing with the politics of my dissertation committee.Many of us think we understand adulthood. We definite it as the opposite of childhood. Adults don\u2019t do certain things.What a shitty definition.Or we define adulthood through labor, pain, and sacrifice. Sure, maturity means you put others\u2019 needs first sometimes. You give up some things you want. You delay gratification for a bigger reward.But you can\u2019t do that all the time. Many of us try. That\u2019s how we wind up miserable, inflicting punishment on others, including our kids. We try to make them grow up, so they stop having the fun that we can\u2019t.This was starting to happen to me. So it\u2019s a good thing I went to that Christmas party, and looked at those shelves of action figures. Around that time, my friends started suggesting I lighten up. \u201cYou should buy a game,\u201d another friend said to me. \u201cIt\u2019ll solve all your problems.\u201dHe was a lawyer who spent significant portions of his nights and weekends playing online strategy games. It made him happy.\u201cBull shit,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t even afford a game.\u201dBut I could.That weekend, I bought my first computer game in almost five years. A simulation game called The Movies. It hooked me immediately. Basically, you run a movie studio. Hire actors. Build sets. Produce films. And release them to the public. It was\u2026incredibly fun. My stress melted off.Guilt kicked in Sunday night. I\u2019d spent almost all weekend building my movie studio. No time on my dissertation, or grading. It was touch and go for a couple of weeks, but I found a balance.When you suppress your inner child for years on end, it tends to run amok at the first sign of freedom.Consider all the unhealthy habits we develop as adults to cope with strife. Anxiety. Frustration.Imagine how many times we could medicate ourselves by doing something we enjoy, even if it sounds embarrassing. Like wearing a superhero costume around the house, or napping with a stuffed animal.Most kids have powerful imaginations. They play pretend and make believe all the time, until they \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d But do they grow out of it, or do we shame them out? Adults seem to do everything we can to kill that spirit in kids, and then kids learn to kill it in themselves.Some of us manage to escape. Even if I did stop buying toys, I never stopped play-pretending. I just do it in my head now, so nobody can judge me. You have no idea how much of my day I spend pretending that I\u2019ll have to start preparing for the zombie apocalypse soon.I\u2019ve got a long mental to-do list.For a year, my mind turned a tiny one bedroom apartment into a pilot\u2019s barracks on a sci-fi battleship. At night, I\u2019d look at the sky and imagine myself traveling through outer space.Some adults hate it when others have fun. Especially if that fun looks childish. Another friend of mine worked at a shipping company while saving money for grad school. She got in trouble for playing at work. Specifically, she made a village out of discarded packing materials.And she made people.She gave the village people voices and personalities. Sometimes, natural disasters visited my friend\u2019s village. Some of her coworkers thought it was funny. Others complained. It creeped them out.Her boss made her take it down.\u201cI\u2019m your most efficient employee,\u201d she argued. It was true. Supervisors praised her speed and reliability.It didn\u2019t matter. She was acting like a kid at work. And that just wouldn\u2019t do. Her village wasn\u2019t a safety hazard, though. The only policy she\u2019d violated was having fun while doing a great job.So my friend took her lunch break and pretended she was Godzilla, smashing her village with reckless abandon. If I remember, she got written up. Now she\u2019s a Fulbright fellow, who\u2019s published a book with Oxford UP. Here\u2019s someone who managed to preserve the best parts of her inner kid, despite the world\u2019s contempt, and prospered for it.Gamification has been around for decades, but it\u2019s making a comeback. Some teachers criticize the idea. Education should be hard and boring, because it\u2019s meant to prepare kids and teens for dull lives.Instead, we should be preparing kids for fun and meaningful lives, so they turn into pleasant adults \u2014 not jerks who think the only goal worth pursuing is an ever widening profit margin.Kids already know how to gamify, because it comes naturally. They can turn almost anything into a game, even dishes.Try it sometime.The difference between imagination and Walter Mitty style mental illness is that you know you\u2019re temporarily changing reality, for a specific purpose. Doing so doesn\u2019t always mean you\u2019re trying to escape.Trying so hard to adult is bad for your health. Kids engage in plenty of unhealthy habits too, but play and imagination aren\u2019t among them. The ways we go about it should evolve, not die.Sometimes adulthood just boils down to understanding that, unlike your video game characters, you really will die if you don\u2019t make that jump. And you can\u2019t live off magic mushrooms.Building a bear at the mall won\u2019t solve all your problems. But if it lifts your mood for a couple of hours, why not? It\u2019s better than spending those two hours stressing over something you can\u2019t control.Kids play with toys for the same reason adults do. It\u2019s fun. It relieves stress. Provides a momentary escape from our problems.Before Toys R Us closed down, I bought a doll and a light-up fairy wand for my niece. The cashier made fun of me. Left me sputtering for an explanation. \u201cNot, it\u2019s not f-f-f-or me.\u201d Screw that guy. If I wanted a doll, that\u2019s my choice. Even if I\u2019ll have to buy it online now.One of the stupidest things we can do is fake adulthood, or deny ourselves something because it\u2019s childish. We deal with enough hardship. So let\u2019s watch cartoons, play games, and eat cereal when we can.Written byWritten by","9314":"Where are the men that know what they did is horrible?There\u2019s something missing in the deluge of discussion about sexual assault.We struggle with the defiant denying of wrongdoing. We boil over in rage at the dismissal of victims. We loathe the smug faces of men who swat away accusations from the air like the accusers are mere pests to be done away with. The justification of actions attributed to boys being boys.I laid in bed last night trying to finally process the events of the last week in order to get to the point where I stop thinking about it. One thing kept coming to the surface:There is one voice we don\u2019t hear. I have scoured the internet trying to find it. I have come up empty. It\u2019s better that it we don\u2019t hear it but I know it\u2019s out there.It\u2019s the voice of the men that have watched this circus and are hit by the realization that THEY are one of THEM.They have committed sexual assault.If there are millions of women who have been sexually assaulted, there are millions of men that did it. I can\u2019t believe that every single one of them has lived their lives as horrible monsters of human beings.They are the men that would not deny what they did and that it was wrong. They would not ask a Senate Committee to defend them.Just as women are coming to their own realizations about being victims, assailants are having the same realization. I imagine a man sitting in his living room, watching this coverage and thinking back to his own high school or college days and it striking a chord.He did this. That there is some woman out there that feels the same way as these scores of women. And it\u2019s his fault.Let me be absolutely clear. I am not accepting what this hypothetical man may have done. I am not saying it\u2019s okay. I am not saying that he should not feel like a terrible and horrible human in the process of his realization.What I am saying is that my concern lies in the man processing this himself. So, if you are reading this and you woke up today struggling with being one of the bad guys, I have some words for you.You can\u2019t take it back. You can\u2019t undo it. But, if you could, you would. In a fractured, broken heartbeat. You must live with this and that is your lot in life.Being sorry is the best you can do. You can\u2019t change history. Let your acknowledgement be your start but don\u2019t finish there.Do something with your realization. Steep yourself in it. Be compassionate. Be humane. Stand up for women. Essentially, now that you know you were part of the problem, be part of the solution. Teach your sons well. Speak respect.Lastly, talk to someone. Find help. Confide. Seek a professional. Be obligated to populate the world with better men. Actively be one of the good guys now. No one is going to make you feel better. That\u2019s not our job.Forgiveness will never come to you. You will not be absolved. If your shame needs to be reconciled, it\u2019s on you. Just do the work. Carry the weight.Mostly likely, we will never hear from these men. I don\u2019t think it is within human nature to out oneself for public shame. But, my fool heart and forgiving soul allows me to understand that everyone needs and is deserving of healing.Written byWritten by","9348":"There\u2019s so much writing out there these days about narcissism and toxicity. But a lot of it point to signs and signals that are actually quite extreme \u2014 obvious behaviours, when the reality of toxic relationships tends to be far more insidious. I\u2019ve reflected on this a lot lately, as part of my Ethical Living Project. Not only do I want to really consider what it means to live well, but also what makes my relationships valuable and how I can be a valuable friend to others.Self-awareness is linked to empathy, and we can all be guilty of bad behaviour at times. But shining the light and taking the time to reflect can make us all better people \u2014 and help us realise who isn\u2019t holding up their end of the bargain, as a friend, lover, whatever (Note: I\u2019m going to refer to the person in question as \u2018friend\u2019 going forward, for ease). Here are my observations of what makes a relationship turn sour:This is really toxic behaviour 101. A person who can\u2019t listen is going to struggle to be much of a friend, and it\u2019s pretty clear when this happens. It\u2019s not the same as being forgetful \u2014 which happens. We\u2019re human! We don\u2019t have perfect memories. But there\u2019s a scale of how important something is to you and how important it is that someone else remembers it.A lot of this boils down to whether they seemed to be listening in the first place. Are they making eye contact? Are they responding? Do they ask any follow up questions? Does it feel like they care? Or are they eager to start talking themselves, interrupt or cut you off? If they\u2019re doing everything right, they could just be forgetful. But if they\u2019re showing signs of disinterest from the start, it\u2019s a red flag.I\u2019ve had a friend who would ask me a genuine question with all the positive signs, but I could feel her impatience for it to be \u2018her turn\u2019 to talk. This meant that I often rushed through what I wanted to say at top speed, eager to be able to finish a thought without interruption. When I realised I did this, I deliberately slowed down. Sure enough, she\u2019d interrupt, take over the conversation, and never ask me to finish. And so I didn\u2019t, and she didn\u2019t notice. I finally realised that what I had to say didn\u2019t matter much to her \u2014 better late than never.This is about values. If you value something \u2014 a hobby, activity, job, person, whatever \u2014 you naturally want a friend to care a little about that important thing. You don\u2019t have to love scuba diving the way they do \u2014 you don\u2019t have to get into the sea with them. But it\u2019s a good-friend-thing to ask and show support, even in a small sense.Support is about offering interest, feedback and encouragement \u2014 even a critique can be a show of support, if it\u2019s done in the interests of helping your friend out. You\u2019ll discover the toxic person, because they\u2019ll be the first to come up with an excuse as to why they can\u2019t\/won\u2019t support you. And there\u2019s always a reason \u2014 a slightly lame excuse why doing you a kindness was just impossible for them.Toxic people will make a lot of excuses and get very defensive about bad behaviour, if and when you notice it. If you tell them honestly that something they did made you uncomfortable, they will immediately come up with ten ways in which it wasn\u2019t their fault \u2014 there was another mysterious factor in play, and you are totally wrong to have any feelings about the matter. Chances are it has nothing to do with what was possible, and everything to do with the fact that they don\u2019t want to feel responsible towards you. Not as your friend, not in any sense.If your friend is indeed a good one, they\u2019re as excited for you to succeed as you are for them. You want to see each other do well. You want happiness for your friend, as they do for you. But there\u2019s often that one person who can\u2019t put jealousy aside for any of that \u2014 the person who is secretly (or not so secretly) in competition with you. I certainly have had friends who, also being writers, seemed to feel they were in direct competition with me, rather than wanting to work together to improve.If something\u2019s gone well and you\u2019re excited to share, watch out for the person who immediately finds a way to belittle your achievement \u2014 looking for a loophole, a way to dust the sheen from your mood, who uses negativity, or suggests they did something way more impressive. The other big one is passive aggression \u2014 what looks like it could be a genuine question, compliment, or comment, actually comes with a backhand. Toxic.It can\u2019t always be you who does the \u2018friendship work\u2019. It can be hard to tell when this one happens \u2014 maybe you just naturally reach out. But after a while it can become clear when the other party is simply not trying. I\u2019ve had friends who seemed amazingly engaged in our relationship when we were together, but who seemed to routinely disappear into the woodwork \u2014 until another personal crisis came along. We all want to reach out when we\u2019re in need, but that shouldn\u2019t be the only time we do so.There are other ways this can manifest, too. I had a friend with whom it was nearly impossible to schedule a meeting. The only way I could see them is if I travelled literally to them, at their convenience, which often changed last minute. While this seems like a petty detail, after a while it gets a little tiring. You can\u2019t be relied on to do it all \u2014to use the cliche, it takes two to tango \u2014 and if someone is incapable of meeting halfway (literally or metaphorically), the friendship work starts to get a little one-sided.I\u2019ve been guilty of being highly reactive when I\u2019m under stress. As a consequence, I try my best to separate someone who\u2019s just under pressure from someone who is constantly prickly. And you will, soon enough, tell the difference. That person who \u2014 rain, hail or shine \u2014 seems to turn to displeasure at the drop of a hat. Someone who is impossible to please, whose standards ensure you will always fall short, or who is always looking for a reason to correct you, berate you or argue with you.I\u2019ve had a friend who disappeared because they didn\u2019t like something I said in a text. I carried on texting as normal, never receiving a response, and wondering why I could see them \u2018read\u2019 my texts without replying. When I clarified what I\u2019d done to displease them later, they made it clear they thought it better to \u2018punish\u2019 me by ghosting me, rather than address the situation. From there onwards, I was always on eggshells, waiting for what other (to me) innocuous thing would cause them to \u2018punish\u2019 me again. And there was always something \u2014 avoiding the mines got pretty tough.This is deliberate, a manipulation tactic designed to throw you off and make it hard for you to defend yourself, because they are always the victim. Someone who ensures that anything you say is a cause for antipathy is terribly hard work, and incredibly toxic. It can be hard to come to terms with the fact that you\u2019ll never please them. It might well be better not to try.Nobody likes to lose a connection, especially as you get into those post-university years, as you move jobs or cities, or just get into that adult age category where new friendships feel impossible. It can be hard to accept that, despite all the work you did, a connection simply isn\u2019t working out. But if you observe these behaviours in someone routinely, it might well be time to face the music. What are they adding to your life? How much are they there for you as a friend, versus the amount of time they are causing you pain?It\u2019s not impossible to make new friends. Certainly, it isn\u2019t easy. But your city will have community courses, craft groups, sports teams, community centres, church groups. I particularly like Obby and Meetup. You have neighbours, work colleagues, and you can always start with the friends who you do already have and cherish. Encourage the people around you to get together \u2014 introduce your friends to each other. It\u2019s a great way to get started.For every narcissist you encounter, there are loads of decent, respectful, interesting and cool people. It\u2019s time to make the people you value the kind of people you can admire, rely on, support, trust, be open with and cherish.Written byWritten by","9410":"Milk has been a part of my diet since infancy. I was breast fed by my mother and after that, by the family cow. Then the neighbor\u2019s cows. Then by cows I had never met via school lunches and grocery stores.Daily consumption of milk was absolutely vital to a child\u2019s health, we believed. Especially for building strong bones and teeth. That\u2019s what the American Dairy Council told us, and it was easy for everyone to accept. Milk was chalk-white, like bones, like teeth, like sea shells. Calcification turned things stony-hard. If you want strong bones, you have to drink milk.It was an easy fiction to maintain in my community, made up primarily of people of northern European stock. Not too many of my classmates and none of my neighbors claimed roots in Africa or Asia. We never heard of lactose intolerance or casein sensitivity.For the longest time, the minimal daily requirement for calcium was set by the National Institutes of Health and the National Academy of Sciences at 800 mg, and 1200 mg for pregnant or nursing mothers. The new RDA is between 1,000 and 1,300 mg. Without at least three of glasses of milk or dairy-product equivalents each day, osteoporosis awaited. Calcium was in every multivitamin. To get calcium into your bones, you have to eat calcium and the more you eat, the more you get.CalciumCalcium is a compact, powerful little ion that performs essential tasks in the body besides making bones hard. It is important for the regulation of many aspects of metabolism, which it does by activating proteins. Imagine, if you will, a small heavy ball with two plus charges on it (++). It can reach into little crevices and niches in big, clumpy proteins and when its ++ charge attaches to certain amino acids, it causes the protein to change shape. The result can be anything from muscles contracting to channels opening through the walls of cells.Calcium is so powerful that its concentration in the blood must be kept within a very narrow range. Too much or too little, and your heart will stop.For this reason, the body controls calcium very carefully. You can\u2019t just eat a lot of it and expect it to be taken up into the blood stream like salt or sugar. Calcium is pulled from the gut into the body only as needed. That process of absorption is controlled by a form of vitamin D. Insufficient vitamin D leads to insufficient calcium absorption.Once in the blood, about half of the calcium is transported attached to proteins with the rest of it floating free. At the bones, the dual processes of depositing calcium into the matrix or releasing it is controlled by cells called osteoblasts (bone-makers) and osteoclasts (bone-breakers). Stressing the bones during exercise will activate the bone-makers and times of famine, pregnancy, or lactation when there is not enough calcium will activate the bone-breakers to release the precious mineral.These multiple points of control along with the potential dangers of calcium imbalance are why just eating the RDA of calcium isn\u2019t enough to manage bone health and stave off osteoporosis.Exercise and hormonesWeight-bearing exercise stresses the skeletal system and triggers the biochemical signals to absorb and pack on more calcium. Eating right and getting enough vitamin D will not substitute for exercise in preventing osteoporosis.The steroid hormones testosterone, estrogen and progesterone play crucial roles regulating bone health as well. Addressing hormonal issues, especially at menopause, is important and requires the help of a trained and certified clinician.But back to milk\u2026Mammals do not need milk beyond infancy. A fairly recent genetic aberration in human evolution gave northern Europeans the ability to consume dairy products in adulthood. Other herding cultures have found ways of making use of mammalian milk, sometimes by altering the chemistry through fermentation. But for the rest of humanity, milk has never been available, let alone necessary, for bone or any other kind of health.Green vegetables, legumes and fish provide more than enough. Indeed, tofu, salmon, sardines, almond milk, and chickpeas all offer even more calcium per serving than cow\u2019s milk does.Other factors for bone healthCalcium does not act in a vacuum. It is deposited in the collagen connective tissue matrix of the bone, so adequate protein, copper and vitamin C are equally important to bone health. Phosphorus and magnesium must also be present and often a functional magnesium deficiency may be more limiting than calcium. Fortunately, all of these bone health factors are abundant in a plant-based whole foods diet.Vitamin DThe \u201csunshine vitamin\u201d was only discovered in 1928, though the disease its absence caused and the remedy through cod liver oil was established long before that. Vitamin D deficiency resulted in rickets, a disease characterized by weak and wobbly bones.We now understand more clearly how vitamin D controls the uptake of calcium from the gut and the optimal amount of vitamin D in the diet was also set at 400 i.u. (International Units \u2014 a unit for measuring oil-soluble vitamins, which can\u2019t be conveniently measured in milligrams). In special cases like pregnancy and lactation, the RDA was 800 i.u.We were off by about a factor of ten.Vitamin D does a lot more than just enhance bone density and prevent osteoporosis and rickets. Vitamin D receptors can be found in the blood vessel walls, in the brain, and on immune cells. It plays an important role in regulating blood pressure, weight and mood. It probably protects against cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. It plays an important role in the immune system, particularly in regulating the so-called \u201cnatural killer\u201d or NK cells. These cells are particularly important in fighting cancer.The levels of vitamin D in the blood that were considered normal and healthy \u2014 above 30 ng% \u2014 would keep rickets at bay. But some really powerful things happen with the immune system and in the brain when vitamin D levels reach and rise above 50 ng%. Mental and emotional health are noticeably improved. Many of us working in age management now believe that taking enough vitamin D to keep the levels between 50 and 100 ng% is the optimal strategy and supporting those levels may require as much as 5,000 to 10,000 i.u. per day (depending on sunlight exposure.)The previous RDA of 400\u2013800 i.u. may prevent rickets but isn\u2019t optimal.Should we supplement with calcium and vitamin D?You can get all of the factors necessary for bone health in a plant-based whole foods diet. But would supplementation with extra calcium be beneficial? Because calcium absorption depends upon vitamin D more than calcium content of the food, probably not. At least not if you eat a healthy plant-based diet. Vitamin D supplementation, on the other hand, is something to consider.Caution is warranted. There is no way to predict blood levels of vitamin D based on how much you ingest. Absorption of vitamin D \u2014 an oil-soluble vitamin \u2014 is greatly affected by the fat content of the diet. Exposure to sunlight creates vitamin D, so that is also a confounding factor. Taking large doses of vitamin D along with oil-containing foods in a sunny environment could push you over the 100 ng% upper level of safety, resulting in dangerously high levels of calcium, which in addition to threatening heart function can manifest in calcification of tissues, possibly including blood vessels and kidney stones.Vitamin D toxicity is extremely rare, but easily avoided with a simple blood test. And the potential benefits of supplementation are substantial.Written byWritten by","9428":"The results from new and pooled research on low carbohydrate diets were presented at the European Society of Cardiology\u2019s 2018 Congress in August by researchers based in the UK, Poland, Sweden, and Greece. The findings are not good for those following low carb diets.To carb or not to carb? That has been the question, and the source of several polite (and not-so-polite) conversations with friends, family, and random strangers online. And the answer, at least according to the study in question, is a resounding to carb!The researchers concluded that low carbohydrate diets are unsafe and should therefore not be recommended to patients. There is a small subset of patients for whom low carb diets are likely beneficial, but physicians cannot in good faith recommend low carb diets to the average individual who is seeking to lose weight or maintain weight. Low carbohydrate diets can indeed be effective for weight loss, but they do not appear to be suitable \u2014 or safe \u2014 for the long-term.And though ketogenic and other low carb diets have been popular for several decades, particularly with those looking to shed a few pounds, cutting carbs has remained controversial to doctors and health experts alike. At the peak of the low carb diet craze in the late 1990s and early 2000s, nearly 20 percent of the American population was estimated to be following a low carbohydrate diet of one form or another.Previous studies have been in short supply, and those available have been inconclusive or incomplete. Regardless of the paucity of comprehensive research, several \u201chealth gurus\u201d, nutritionists, dieticians, naturopaths, and even medical doctors around the world have spent a great deal of energy and time promoting ketogenic and low carbohydrate diets to the general public. Some have made their fortunes this way. The sheer number of books and articles written on the subject speaks to the popularity of the low carb movement.The study we\u2019re exploring today could mark the first in a series of critical blows about to hit the low carb and keto communities. Due to the size of the cohorts in the experiments reviewed and due to the length of time the individuals were followed, the results are particularly convincing.Study author Maciej Banach, of the Medical University of Lodz, Poland, said: \u201cWe found that people who consumed a low carbohydrate diet were at greater risk of premature death. Risks were also increased for individual causes of death including coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer. These diets should be avoided.\u201dThe researchers looked at the relationship between low carbohydrate diets and all-cause mortality, as well as death due to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease (e.g. stroke), and cancer. Their research subjects were part of a large and nationally representative cohort of 24,825 Americans, and study data was collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), covering the years 1999\u20132010. The mean age of participants was 47.6 years old, and the cohort was 48.6 percent men and 51.4 percent women.Participants who had the lowest carbohydrate intake had a 32 percent higher risk of all-cause mortality over an average of 6.4 years follow-up, while the risk of mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer increased by 50 percent, 51 percent, and 35 percent, respectively.The researchers then performed a meta-analysis using seven prospective cohort studies. The meta-analysis validated the scientists\u2019 own findings, and taken together included 447,506 participants.\u201cWe showed that subjects in the top quartile (those with the lowest intake of carbohydrate) had the highest risk of total mortality,\u201d the researchers said. Additionally, they found a significant link between low carbohydrate\/high protein diets and cancer mortality. The research team notes that further studies will clarify the mechanisms behind these associations.The take-home message: Unless you have a particular medical condition that has evidence-based and well-documented reasons for following a long-term low carbohydrate diet, it is best to avoid low carb and ketogenic diets altogether. Stick with balanced diets rich in healthy carbs, like whole grain breads, buckwheat porridge, sweet potatoes and yams, and blueberries \u2014 to name just a few.Low carb diets have been around for quite a long time, and the first formulations were also linked to health and weight loss. Here are some of the key players that have contributed to our long-standing obsession with low carb diets (an obsession that may be on its way out):1863\u20131869: William Banting promotes a low carb diet for weight loss and health, based on his own success losing weight.1921: Low carbohydrate diets are used to treat paediatric epilepsy. These diets can still be used today for some children who do not respond to medication, but in most cases medication is preferred.1927: Explorer and ethnologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson promotes an Inuit diet, based on the diets of Inuits in Iceland and Canada. In today\u2019s terms, we would consider this a \u201czerocarb\u201d or \u201cextreme keto\u201d approach.1935: Though suffering from a serious lack of evidence, the alkaline diet is all the rage. Many carbs and starchy foods are thought to be \u201cacid forming,\u201d and must therefore be avoided.1967: The Stillman diet is created by Dr. Irwin Maxwell Stillman. It is a kind of \u201cproto-Atkins diet,\u201d with a focus on low carb and high protein ketogenic eating. The Stillman diet promotes six small meals a day.1972: Dr. Robert C. Atkins publishes \u201cDr. Atkins\u2019 New Diet Revolution,\u201d kicking off the very popular Atkins diet trend. Robert Atkins is said to have died from a fall that occurred nine days prior to his death (at the age of 72), but a medical report showed that he had clear signs of having suffered a history of heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure.1975: Walter L. Voegtlin publishes \u201cThe Stone Age Diet.\u201d The advice is to \u201ceat like a caveman\u201d \u2014 a diet high in meat and seafood; with moderate fruit and vegetable intake; and very low or no grains, dairy, or added sugar or salt.1985: Stanley Boyd Eaton and Melvin Konner publish a paper called \u201cPaleolithic Nutrition,\u201d which supports Voegtlin\u2019s Stone Age diet. 2002: The Stone Age diet makes a comeback in the form of \u201cThe Paleo Diet\u201d by Loren Cordain, founder of the Paleo Movement.2003: Dr. Arthur Agatston publishes \u201cThe South Beach Diet.\u201d The focus is on foods with a low glycemic index (GI) and low glycemic load (GL).2015: Dr. Michael Mosley publishes \u201cThe 8-Week Blood Sugar Diet.\u201d It\u2019s a low carb, Mediterranean style diet that includes optional intermittent fasting and ultra low calorie options. The blood sugar diet is promoted for those at risk of developing Type 2 diabetes or for those who have already been diagnosed with diabetes or metabolic syndrome.Ketogenic diets regain popularity and are marketed for weight loss purposes. The trend continues to this day.This timeline has been adapted from the Diatetically Speaking website by Maeve Hanan.by Kristen HovetOriginally published at www.brigidmag.com on October 31, 2018.Written byWritten by","9431":"I like to look at life like an ocean. Some days the waves are calm, some days the waves are choppy, other days the waves are enormous and will wipe you out.For much of my life, I never really appreciated how calm the waves around me were. Life has been very good to me. I\u2019ve lived in pretty peaceful seas.Over the last year however, I\u2019ve been through a lot of things that have taken me through a whirlwind of emotions. I shut down my company, started a new job, went through a breakup, stopped talking to my one of my older brothers, and largely been asking myself a lot of longer term questions about what the hell I want out of life.Needless to say, the oceans have been a lot more choppy this year. Waves of emotion have overwhelmed me on several occasions. There have been times where I sit down to meditate and my body is swirling with feelings I have never felt before. It\u2019s been both scary, overwhelming, and exciting all the same.These experiences have taught me to appreciate when the waves are calm. To appreciate the days when I sit down to meditate and have nothing to worry about, nothing on my mind. To be grateful for the times in my life when there are no serious problems causing turbulent waves.It\u2019s made me appreciate when the waves are calm \u2014 because when the storms of life come your way you\u2019ll be clutching onto the boat for dear life.As we grow older, we\u2019re naturally going to face more problems in life. Take time to appreciate the days when you don\u2019t have any serious problems. Take time to be grateful for the fact that nothing is wrong.When was the last time you appreciated a normal, regular, boring, routine, day?When was the last time you simply said, \u201cshit, today nothing happened! Wow, I\u2019m so grateful to live a calm and peaceful life.\u201dDale Carnegie famously said \u201cMost of us worry about the 10% that\u2019s wrong with our lives instead of the 90% that is perfect.\u201dThis is one of those moments to appreciate the 90%. To remember that, most likely, everything is going to be OK. You\u2019re exactly where you need to be and you are already the best version of yourself.This week I challenge you to reflect on the things that you take for granted in life. Try to identify a part of your life you overlooked and think about how different your life would be if this no longer was a part of your existence.Remember that if you have food to eat, clothes on your back, a roof over your head, a job that pays you money, and people to share these experiences with, you have literally everything you need in life. The rest is a bonus.Appreciate. Be grateful.

Most of know it\u2019s healthy, so we suffer through it, like we do any other chore. But we don\u2019t enjoy it.Evolutionarily, we depended on being able to run, lift, and swim. You\u2019d think we should love it, the way we do eating a good meal, or spending time with loved ones, both of which confer an evolutionary advantage.So why don\u2019t we?Physically, our bodies are loaded with features that make us good at running. We have heads that stay still when we run, short toes that need less energy to stabilize, the Achilles tendon built to store and release energy as we run.However, there\u2019s probably selection pressure against what our brains deem to be unnecessary exercise. When calories are scarce, like they were for the majority of our evolutionary history, anyone burning additional body mass was at a disadvantage.\u2026there was probably selection to help people avoid needless exercise when they could. Some hunter-gatherers had diets of about 2,200 calories a day. When your energy intake is that low, you can\u2019t afford to go for a jog just for fun. \u2014 Daniel Lieberman, evolutionary biologist of Harvard.So our bodies are perfect for it. But we still hate running. And there\u2019s no way to force yourself to like it.Or so I used to think.This morning, I popped in my headphones, hopped into my running shoes, and jogged out the door. I could have taken the bus, but I was excited to go for my morning run to work, and excited for the next episode of my latest podcast.This is coming from someone who has never liked to voluntarily exercise.But there I was, ponytail swinging and legs pumping, getting some morning fresh air and loving it.This is my experience with what scientists call temptation bundling: pairing a \u201cwant\u201d behavior with a \u201cshould\u201d behavior.In this case, the \u201cwant\u201d is to listen to my podcast. The \u201cshould\u201d is the running.Why this immediate reward work to encourage us to make healthier choices?By rewarding a delayed gratification activity such as going to the gym, healthy eating, or even doing taxes, with an immediate gratification \u201cguilty pleasure,\u201d which can be binging a trashy Netflix show, or a funny podcast, our brains learn to associate the immediate pleasure with the behavior we should be doing.For me, I found that listening to a story-based podcast, like My Dad Wrote a Porno, or a really gripping audiobook, like The Hunger Games or Gone Girl while running tricked my brain into thinking that by doing the exercise, I would get an immediate, stimulating reward.For yourself, think about what your \u201cshould\u201d behaviors are. Do you want to get better at saving money? Maybe you want to commit to cleaning the house for half an hour each day.Then pick what your \u201cwant\u201d behaviors. Is it drinking a really nice beverage? Do you love getting pedicures?The last step is to simply do them at the same time. Listen to your podcast while you clean the house. Drink an expensive glass of Chardonnay as you file your tax return.Personally, I found that wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 I had to restrict my access to the \u201cguilty pleasure.\u201d I only listen to that particularly funny podcast when I jog in to work \u2014 any other time, I listen to motivational, self-improvement podcasts like Optimal Living Daily.Researchers found that people were actually willing to pay to restrict their access to their guilty pleasure, in order to reward themselves for going to the gym, for example.Maybe there\u2019s a future gym which lets you borrow an iPod, pre-loaded with the best page-turners of the year \u2014 but only as long as you show up to exercise.Ultimately, temptation bundling immediately rewards our brain for doing activities we normally don\u2019t enjoy doing, but that gives us long term benefits.

We keep working and working at it, unwilling to let it go until it\u2019s perfect.Sometimes, we feel like we can\u2019t even start because we know we won\u2019t be able to get it just right. We\u2019re afraid to begin because we know it won\u2019t ever be perfect.Perfect doesn\u2019t exist.\u201cPerfectionists\u2026do not derive pleasure from their labors and efforts and tend to view their work as inadequate or inferior.\u201d \u2014 J.J. Kilbert, psychologist at GSUAlthough in some cases perfectionism can drive us to succeed and improve, most of the time it\u2019s debilitating and anxiety-inducing.When I struggled with my eating disorder, I felt lost, alone, and really, really afraid. I knew what I was doing was unhealthy and unsustainable but I couldn\u2019t see a way to just stop.Every day, I would tell myself, would be the last day I made myself throw up, the last day I would eat too much. And then I would trip up again. Feeling like a failure, I continued to overeat, purge, and overexercise in a vicious cycle I couldn\u2019t get out of.But then I found a way out.It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, it just has to be better.My mom cleans the house a lot. Back when my sister, my dad, our two dogs, two cats and I were all at home contributing to the general state of disarray in the house, it was honestly a full-time occupation (on top of her actual job) to keep it liveable.Sometimes she would get distressed (understandably) at the sheer volume of cleaning to do. She would recruit me and my sister to help.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, it just has to be better,\u201d she would tell us.Any bit of help we were able to provide would lighten the load. Even if we didn\u2019t sweep up every speck of dirt, or mop every stain off the kitchen floor, the house would still look better than it did before we started.She was never aiming to have a spotless, immaculate house. She just wanted it to be better than when she started.This was my first experience with dodging perfectionism.Why does aiming for progress rather than perfection let us get away from vicious cycles?Perfectionism makes it hard to take the first step for fear of failure. When you change the target from perfection to just progress, you allow yourself to take a step forward, embracing the possibility of improvement.I recovered from my eating disorder in small, shuffling steps, rather than leaps and bounds.It started when I went home one holiday. I was helping my mom prepare the house for guests and there was a lot of cleaning to do. She told me, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, it just has to be better,\u201d as she passed me the vacuum cleaner.That was the first day I consciously chose not to give into the urge. I knew the next day I might not be able to resist, but I chose to frame that day, that small act of resistance, as a triumph. That was success for me.It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was better. It was a step.Ultimately, I recovered. Maybe not fully \u2014 and maybe I never will. But every time I\u2019m able to tell my eating disorder not today is movement in the right direction.Every day I forgive myself for not being perfect by not even aiming for perfection. I just aim to improve, to progress, to take any step no matter how small. All I need is to remember that I don\u2019t have to be perfect, I just have to be better.Written byWritten by","9523":"For less than a hundred bucks, many companies will take your tube of spit and decode the DNA within. That string of letters holds clues to where you came from and which diseases you and your children could face. By and large, our genetic code doesn\u2019t change.But DNA expression \u2014 how genes get turned on and off \u2014 changes all the time. And with aging and other circumstances, life\u2019s blueprint accrues long-lasting chemical alterations that control how and when certain genes or groups of genes turn on.Unlike the underlying genetic code, which is fixed, these epigenetic modifications are dynamic. Shifting in response to factors including where you live, what you eat, and how much you exercise and sleep, your epigenetic code influences which genes are easily activated and which never or rarely get turned on. These genome-wide patterns could be an index of health at the molecular level. And you can now see what this code says, thanks to companies using technology that \u201cturns DNA testing into this actionable measure of deep health that you can do something about,\u201d says Toby Call, cofounder of a biotech startup called Chronomics in Cambridge, England.In February the company started selling a saliva test that measures an epigenetic marker called DNA methylation, which can shift with environment and lifestyle. Customers who get the $699-a-year basic plan can log onto a web portal to find out their \u201cbiological age\u201d \u2014 a well-established metric built on research by Steve Horvath, a University of California Los Angeles geneticist and biostatistician.Obesity may make the epigenetic clock in human liver cells tick faster, and heroin use can accelerate biological aging in brain cells.Whereas chronological age simply reflects how many years you\u2019ve lived, biological age can vary between two people born in the same year, or even between identical twins. It depends on how you\u2019ve lived and what you\u2019ve encountered. For instance, obesity may make the epigenetic clock in human liver cells tick faster, and heroin use can accelerate biological aging in brain cells. Simply put, biological age reflects how old you seem.Chronomics\u2019 DNA analysis might show, for example, that you\u2019re biologically two years older than your actual age. Navigating your online account, you could compare your aging pattern with others in your city or age group. Each week you can log what you eat and how much time you sleep, work up a sweat, or do a mindfulness practice such as meditation. Clicking a bright orange bar shows how you might \u201cturn back time\u201d through recommendations to reduce your methylation age by eating fewer processed foods or by adopting stress-reducing activities like yoga.For an additional $300 per year, Chronomics\u2019 customers can receive scores for two additional indicators: smoke exposure (how many cigarettes it looks like your body has smoked, including from secondhand sources) and body composition (a color-graded map with risk scores for insulin resistance, heart disease and other obesity-related conditions). All are calculated by next-generation sequencing technology that uses big data and machine learning to hone the predictive power of methylation markers at 5 million sites in the genome, says Call.He was completing his PhD in biochemistry at the University of Cambridge when cofounders Tom Stubbs and Daniel Mart\u00edn Herranz started discussing how the DNA analysis technology they were using in their doctoral projects in computational epigenetics might be used \u201cto do something good in the world,\u201d Call says. The company is now funded by the global venture capital firm SOSV, which runs the RebelBio and IndieBio life science accelerator programs, and by a seed round of funding from a London VC that Call would not reveal.\u201cOur message is choice and change,\u201d he says. So far, many of the company\u2019s hundred or so first customers are people who were interested in health optimization but hadn\u2019t yet chosen a DNA test. At the Biohacker Summit in Toronto last week, Call says, the company drew interest from health tech enthusiasts as well as folks \u201coff the street\u201d \u2014 many of them engineers, doctors, and businesspeople who are \u201cinterested in removing the guesswork with their health.\u201dThe idea that knowing your own DNA methylation status could help you make positive changes seems logical, but lacks scientific support. The promise that \u201cepigenetic marks in apparently healthy people can tell them meaningful things about their health status is an overreach,\u201d says Robert Green, a geneticist at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, who studies how consumer DNA tests influence health behavior.Using DNA methylation to estimate biological age is great as a research tool, and lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking or losing weight can change methylation patterns. But there\u2019s no proof that having that kind of information helps people have better health, agrees Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. Such claims \u201care not substantiated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not true. There\u2019s just no data to support it.\u201dThe promise that \u201cepigenetic marks in apparently healthy people can tell them meaningful things about their health status is an overreach,\u201d says Robert Green.Nevertheless, Call says that some doctors and health coaches are excited by the potential of epigenetics to catalyze positive change that enables people to \u201cstay ahead of the disease curve.\u201d Working with clients who are blind to the health implications of their life habits, he says, health professionals \u201cwant a telescope to provide people with the unavoidable facts and implications of their environmental and lifestyle factors today \u2014 something that until now was impossible.\u201dBy comparison, Chronomics competitor Epimorphy offers no advice or health recommendations with myDNAge, its direct-to-consumer epigenetics test. \u201cWe offer [myDNAge] as a tool for people to know if it works for themselves,\u201d says Yap Ching Chew, director of epigenetics technologies at Zymo Research, which developed the platform used by Epimorphy and shares a founder. Their test, which was introduced in July 2017 at $299, uses next-gen sequencing and measures DNA methylation at 500 sites to compute a person\u2019s biological age from a blood or urine sample. Thousands of people have used the myDNAge test, Chew says.As the company collects and analyzes more data, it hopes to offer more personalized insights in the future. At this point, she says, many myDNAge clients use the test once or twice a year in the hopes of gauging how well their anti-aging supplements are working.Compared to the genetic code, epigenetic information seems more changeable in a biological sense but less actionable in a medical sense, Green says.With genomic data, there are clear links between information received and recommended medical action. For example, says Green, research suggests that certain gene variants increase your sensitivity to specific drugs or increase your risk of certain cancers, so if you learned that you have those DNA variants, you could improve your health by controlling the dosage of that drug or more carefully monitoring for cancer. However, he adds, with epigenetics data very few studies have tested whether health-related advice has any impact on people\u2019s behavior: \u201cWe are in the early days of using DNA variance to predict health and motivate behavior change.\u201dEven though the evidence is still preliminary, says Green, it\u2019s clear that some people are activated by learning about their own DNA, and then they start eating better, exercising, and making other changes well known to improve health: \u201cLearning about health through the prism of your own body \u2026 may motivate people more than learning about it from a public service announcement or from a doctor who says, \u2018You know, you should lose a few pounds.\u2019 \u201dWritten byWritten by","9653":"A case report in 2000described a 24-year-old woman presented to her physicians with some unusual symptoms. During exercise, she experienced a full grand mal seizure, without any previous history of epilepsy. In the prior 6 months, she had become very tired and noted episodes of trembling, blurred vision and confusion. She could control these symptoms by eating something.Upon investigation, she was found to suffer from a rare insulin secreting tumor of the pancreas known as an insulinoma. This tumor was massively overproducing insulin inappropriately, causing her blood sugar to fall very low, going down as far as 1.6 mmol\/L after an overnight fast. She had way too much insulin in her system.Upon further questioning, she also noted acne, hirsutism and her periods had become very irregular, varying from 40 to 44 days over the previous year. An ultrasound revealed polycystic ovaries, and bloodwork revealed high testosterone levels, which gave her a diagnosis of PCOS. She had a normal body mass index and was not overweight.A scan revealed a two-centimeter tumor mass in her pancreas, and she underwent an uneventful surgery to remove it. Four months after her successful operation, her menstrual cycles became regular at 28 days, she lost 4 kg of weight (8.8 pounds), her acne and hirsutism fully resolved. Bloodwork revealed that her insulin level had normalized, and along with it, her testosterone levels.This case provides dramatic insight into the causal role of excessive insulin and PCOS as well as weight gain. Earlier studies had already hinted at its importance. High insulin levels are reported in 75% and 30% of obese and non-obese women. As insulin levels rise, so do rates of obesity, irregular menstrual cycles and blood testosterone levels. In the study of diseases, the most crucial piece of information is the aetiology, a medical term for what causes it. If you do not understand what causes the problem, it is very difficult to design therapies that have a reasonable chance of success. The link with obesity suggests that excessive insulin may play a role in the development of PCOS.Consider the three main symptoms of PCOS:The hormonal underpinnings of PCOS began to be appreciated in the 1950s, with the development of the radioimmunoassay that could measure various hormone levels. In the 1960s and 1970s, research focused on Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), key regulators of the normal menstrual cycle. For many years, an abnormal LH\/FSH ratio was considered diagnostic of PCOS. By the 1980s, testosterone was recognized as the main androgen that was responsible for the majority of problems.Testosterone is produced normally in both the ovaries and the adrenal gland \u2014 a small gland sitting on top of the kidneys. In addition to androgens, the adrenal gland also produces other hormones, including cortisol, adrenalin, and aldosterone.Once we recognized that excessive androgen production caused most of the symptoms of PCOS, the next step was to figure out which organ was responsible for the overproduction. There were only two possibilities \u2014 the ovaries or the adrenal glands. In the normal situation, the ovaries and adrenal glands contribute equally to testosterone production. By 1989, studies showed that in women with PCOS the ovary is the key source of excessive testosterone production. Specifically, it is the theca cells within the ovary that are responsible for the overproduction of hormones.One more line of evidence implicated the ovaries as the source of excess testosterone in PCOS. The initial modern description of PCOS by Stein and Leventhal had also revealed that surgically removing a wedge of the ovary (ovarian wedge resection) often restored normal ovulation and normal menstrual cycles. This is only possible if the source of excess androgens is the ovary. After all, if the adrenal gland was responsible for overproducing androgens, cutting a little wedge of the ovary out would not make any difference. The hyperandrogenism of PCOS secreted mostly by the ovaries, caused the symptoms of hirsutism and infertility.Direct measurement of blood testosterone levels is not part of the diagnostic criteria and is highly problematic for three reasons. First, blood levels vary widely throughout the day and with age and menstrual status. Secondly, even in established PCOS, the ovarian portion of T production only rises to about 60% of total daily production of T. Third, a major contributing factor to the excess androgen effect seen in PCOS (hirsutism, acne etc) is not excessive testosterone, but rather low levels of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).Hormones do not circulate freely. Instead, they travel around the bloodstream bound up with other proteins that accompany them to their proper destination. SHBG is the protein designed to work with testosterone. Imagine you are traveling around New York City for a business meeting. It\u2019s difficult to get to your destination on foot. It\u2019s slow and walk around, you get tempted to shop at stores along the way. You\u2019d never get to your intended destination. So instead, a better solution is to travel around New York City inside a taxi, which brings you directly to your meeting. The same thing happens in our bodies.Hormones travel around the bloodstream accompanied by transport proteins. Otherwise, the unchaperoned \u2018free\u2019 hormones would stop off at every tissue to exert their effects, and never get to their intended destination. The testosterone produced in the ovary might stop by the liver, kidneys and fat tissue before getting to its intended destination of the skin. So, a better solution is to carry the hormones with binding proteins that transport them directly to the target organ. This is true for most hormones in the human body.These hormone-carrying proteins are very specific for each hormone. Thyroid hormone, for example is only carried by thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). The term globulin refers to a protein that is globular in shape, which many of these carrier proteins are. Thyroid hormone can only hitch a ride on its proper globulin (TBG), but cannot bind to say, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which carries testosterone.What happens if the proper carriers are not available? Imagine you are in New York City, just as a baseball game in Yankee Stadium finishes. You find yourself with 50,000 other fans on the street and there are insufficient taxis. All the fans are just milling around the street going into all the stores and bars. It\u2019s overcrowded around Yankee Stadium, but the place where these fans are going (home) are all empty.The same thing happens in our body. If there are not enough carrier proteins like SHBG, then testosterone floats around freely in the blood, just like the fans wandering the streets around Yankee stadium. Testosterone, in high levels starts to exert its masculinizing effects on the neighboring organs because it is not getting to its proper destination. Thus, you develop acne, excessive facial hair and male pattern baldness. The total amount of testosterone might be the same, but the lack of carrier protein, SHBG allows excessive effect of these androgens.HyperinsulinemiaWomen with PCOS have low levels of the carrier proteins SHBG that bind the testosterone. This amplifies testosterones effect, even if levels are not particularly high. But what causes this lack of SHBG? The culprit is too much insulin.Insulin is the major regulator of SHBG production in the liver. The higher the insulin, the lower the SHBG production. This relationship holds true not just in women, but also in men. Decreasing insulin levels through weight loss increases SHBG production.A population based study in Sweden confirmed the inverse relationship. Type 1 diabetics, with very low insulin levels had very high SHBG. Type 2 diabetics, with very high insulin, had very low SHBG. Insulin directly reduces liver production of SHBG and therefore increase the levels of free and bioavailable androgens. Thus, excessive insulin causes both:As far back as 1980 the striking correlation between blood levels of insulin and testosterone was noted. Insulin and testosterone blood levels showed an astounding 85% correlation to each other. These two hormones were moving in almost exact lockstep, which is highly suggestive that one hormone was directly stimulating the other.Did high testosterone cause high insulin, or did high insulin cause high testosterone? Elegant studies with isolated cell cultures clarified this connection. When you purify ovarian cells and bathe them in insulin, they increased testosterone production significantly. The opposite is not true. If you bathe cells in testosterone, nothing happened, since the ovary does not produce insulin. The pancreas is the organ responsible for insulin production and secretion. If you give testosterone to experimental subjects, insulin secretion by the pancreas does not change at all. Clearly, insulin drove testosterone production and not the other way around.Human studies have confirmed that high insulin indeed increases androgen levels. Direct insulin infusion measurably increases the levels of androgens. The more insulin you give, the higher the testosterone production in the ovary. Even after 24 hours after the insulin infusion was stopped, the testosterone levels continued to be elevated. The ovary itself is particularly rich in insulin receptors, which seems rather strange at first glance. Insulin is a hormone most commonly associated with digestion, blood glucose and body fat. Why would the ovaries carry insulin receptors? In fact, the pathways that link reproductive function and metabolism are seen in virtually every animal in existence. This is an evolutionarily conserved trait found in everything from fruit flies to roundworms to human beings. Why?The answer is that all animals need to know that food is available before committing to reproduction. Raising children requires a good deal of resources including adequate food supplies for both the expectant mother and the developing baby. Adults can survive on relatively low levels of food energy and nutrients. During World War II, for example, many people survived on what would now be considered woefully inadequate amounts of food.Adults don\u2019t need to grow, and therefore require less nutrients. The human liver or lung, for example, do not grow once they reach adult size. In tough times, we can break down old liver cells to build new liver cells. A baby, however, must eat enough nutrients to build new liver cells. A baby may enter the world weighing only 7 pounds, but eventually grows to perhaps 150 pounds. In addition to energy for normal cellular function, it must also gain 143 pounds of matter to build proteins, fat cells, internal organs, muscles etc. This is a very resource intensive labor of love.If humans produced too many babies at a time when food is scarce, neither the baby nor the mother would survive. Therefore, the ovary must have reliable information about the availability of food in the outside world. It should only produce eggs at a time that food is available to sustain the growth of the baby. How is this poor ovary supposed to know about the outside world, trapped inside the pelvis, with no eyes, ears or nose of its own?The solution is to develop nutrient sensors that signal ample food availability. Insulin is one of those nutrient sensors. If you eat food, insulin rises, a signal that food is available. The ovary\u2019s insulin receptors pick up this fact, and proceeds along normal development of the human egg. But if too much insulin is available, then the process goes awry.High insulin increases testosterone and decreases SHBG thereby causing the masculinizing features. Blocking insulin decreases testosterone levels and can be demonstrated experimentally with a drug called diazoxide. Lowering insulin with other medications such as metformin or TZDs also have the same effect of lowering testosterone levels.In patients with PCOS, surgical removal of part of the ovaries reverses the hyperandrogenism but not the high insulin levels.It has become increasingly clear that a high insulin level is the primary factor stimulating excessive ovarian production of testosterone. This increased androgen (hyperandrogenism) is responsible for the masculinizing features of PCOS including acne and hirsutism. This is a great start to understanding the aetiology of PCOS. But there are two other main features to consider. Is insulin responsible for the lack of ovulation and polycystic ovaries, too?

It\u2019s deeper than that.Back home from the ER, I\u2019m thinking about the outrageous amount of money we are going to pay for the privilege of now being pain free.The cost of medical care is out of control. I should feel healed, but instead I feel robbed. What are you going to do?When you need help, you need help.Not pleasant thoughts as I wait for the automated call from the pharmacy.The latest trend for my migraines is onset while sleeping. This means I need to have injections on hand to take down the episodes that the pills can\u2019t handle.Expensive. But cheaper than a trip to the ER.There are always trade offs in life. Even if neither option is stellar, you have to pick one and hope for the best.I\u2019m driving to the pharmacy when I realize I accidentally left my cell phone at home. That\u2019s when I started crying.Followed by thinking, \u201cThis is a really weird thing to cry about.\u201dBut I wasn\u2019t really crying about not having an electronic communication device within two feet of me for more than five minutes. (These days there probably are people who would cry about such a quandary.)Nor was I crying about the lack of sleep or the gut-wrenching pain that I had endured. That\u2019s nothing new for a lifelong migraine sufferer.No, the tears were about a sudden overwhelming feeling of being very alone, disconnected in ways beyond the cellular phone network.My mind was instantly convinced that the cars next to me were full of people who knew where they were going. They had a purpose, family, friends.They had fulfilling contributions to make to society. They were reaching personal and professional pinnacles of achievement and garnering rewards of appreciation, fame, fortune, social status, respect and happiness.Me, well, I\u2019m a little off.I tend to fall a bit short of the pinnacle.Most of my life has been in the background, blending in with mediocrity. I\u2019m one of the extras to fill the stage around the stars of the show.I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m doing this life thing right.Maybe I\u2019m not confident enough, talented enough, fun enough, nice enough \u2026I don\u2019t know.I\u2019m just feeling a little off today.Even the touchscreen on my laptop is having trouble recognizing that I exist today.Maybe it\u2019s time for a re-boot.At least Homer, my orange tabby, knows that I exist. Homer doesn\u2019t understand my sadness, but he\u2019s here by my side, devoted as always and purring blissfully.I don\u2019t really understand my sadness either. Is this what depression feels like?How horrible it must be to feel this way day in and day out. My heart goes out to those living in a constant state of depression.And don\u2019t you dare throw that annoyingly overused phrase of the year at me, \u201cFirst world problems, am I right?\u201dI get it, but I don\u2019t like it.I understand that the problems of our ancestors were hard, but those problems were also much different than ours.

My problems are microscopic compared to those of so many others. Most days I know this and am thankful for the life with which I have been blessed.Today, I\u2019m just a little off.Perhaps a moratorium on thinking should be implemented until I\u2019m a little less off.According to Orphan Annie and the local meteorologist, \u201cThe sun will come out tomorrow.\u201dFingers crossed!Join my email list to keep in touch with me.

Without a mature egg, conception cannot occur, leading to the devastating realization that one cannot have a baby.During normal menstruation, progesterone is produced after ovulation by the remnant of the dominant follicle. Without ovulation, this does not occur and there is too little progesterone leading to heavy periods and irregularity. This leads clinically to the irregular cycles found in PCOS. Almost all women will experience some anovulatory cycles in their lifetimes, especially during puberty and menopause.However, the underlying cause of the anovulation is the excessive insulin and testosterone once again. Since testosterone is mostly overproduced due to high insulin, the singular, most responsible culprit for anovulatory cycles is high insulin. Weight loss and metformin both lower plasma T and improve ovulatory rates, and is the reason metformin is widely used in this disease. Indeed, all known treatments to reduce insulin, including weight loss, bariatric surgery, the drugs somatostatin and metformin significantly improve ovulatory function and symptoms of PCOS. Interestingly, patients with type 1 diabetes using high doses of injected insulin also have an increased risk of PCOS.The three defining features of PCOS include polycystic ovaries, anovulatory cycles, and masculine features. All three symptoms reflect the same pathophysiology \u2014 too much testosterone, ultimately caused by too much insulin.Simply put \u2014 too much insulin causes PCOS.Insulin ResistanceLike obesity, PCOS is best understood as a disease of hyperinsulinemia. This explains the close connection between obesity and PCOS \u2013they are both manifestations of an underlying hyperinsulinemia. They do not always occur together, but are closely associated. But what is causing the high insulin levels?Dietary factors, such as excessive sugar and refined carbohydrates, are certainly important, but they are not the only factor causing high insulin. The other major factor that increases insulin is the presence of a condition known as insulin resistance.Recall that insulin is a hormone that moves glucose from the blood inside the cells. In the state of \u2018insulin resistance\u2019, the normal insulin levels are not able to move glucose inside. The body responds by ramping up insulin levels to force the blood glucose into the cells. Thus, insulin resistance is a key factor in keeping insulin levels high, even without any change in the diet.PCOS is highly associated with both insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin sensitivity is decreased on average 30\u201340% in women with PCOS, a degree similar to that seen in type 2 diabetes. Obesity itself is highly linked to insulin resistance, but it is also present in normal weight adolescents with PCOS. Even independent of obesity, insulin resistance is diagnosed in 75% of lean women with PCOS. In overweight women with PCOS, this proportion increases to a massive 95%. Essentially, all overweight women with PCOS have evidence of insulin resistance.In addition, normal weight girls with PCOS had evidence of more fatty liver than those without PCOS, another disease associated with insulin resistance. Increased insulin resistance is the essential feature of type 2 diabetes.So, insulin resistance causes high insulin levels which will contribute to PCOS. But what causes this insulin resistant state in the first place? It turns out to be the high insulin levels itself. We\u2019ve discussed this previously in the entire series on Diabetes as well as in my book, The Diabetes Code.So, PCOS is really just another manifestation of metabolic disease, all of which are caused by too much insulin \u2014 hyperinsulinemia. This is crucial knowledge, because if the root cause of PCOS (and obesity and type 2 diabetes) is too much insulin, then the solution becomes fairly obvious \u2014 lower insulin. How to do that? The solution is certainly not drilling holes into the ovary. The solution is largely dietary. Low carbohydrate diets and fasting.Written byWritten by","9837":"I love bread.There isn\u2019t much better \u2014 or more satisfying \u2014 than tearing into a freshly-baked, warm loaf of bread.Obviously I\u2019m not alone. People have been eating bread for over 30,000 years, and it remains the most widely-consumed food in the world.Bread is a simple delicacy.A traditional loaf only needs 4 ingredients: Flour, yeast, water, and salt.And yeast (as an added ingredient) is actually unnecessary with natural leavens or sourdoughs.It\u2019s no wonder that bread has been a reliable source of nutrition and sustenance since the earliest days.But go into any grocery store these days and look at the ingredient label on a package of bread. You\u2019ll see a lot more than those few basic ingredients.To pick on an easy target, Wonder Bread\u2019s Classic White bread has over 30 ingredients, including things like high fructose corn syrup, monoglycerides and diglycerides, sodium stearoyl lactylate, calcium peroxide, monocalcium phosphate, modified corn starch, ammonium sulfate, and calcium propionate.I\u2019m not sure what all of those things are, but they don\u2019t sound much like flour, yeast, water, and salt. And I don\u2019t really want them in my body.It\u2019s no surprise that Wonder Bread is remarkably white and light, stays soft and \u201cfresh\u201d on the shelf for weeks, and presumably is quite fast and cheap to produce.But the use of unhealthy additives is not restricted only to the likes of Wonder Bread.Take Nature\u2019s Own Honey Wheat Bread, for example. You\u2019d think this bread would be pretty good for you. After all, Nature\u2019s Own promises no artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors, and no high fructose corn syrup.Plenty of people seem to be buying into this promise \u2014 The Nature\u2019s Own website says their Honey Wheat bread is the #1 selling loaf of bread in the U.S.But look a bit deeper, and you\u2019ll notice that in each loaf of that bread you\u2019ll get inflammatory-fat-laden soybean oil, monoglycerides, and DATEM \u2014 a shelf-stabilizing emulsifier that is often made from artery-clogging partially hydrogenated oils.Nature\u2019s Own shouldn\u2019t feel so bad, though. Both the 100% Whole Wheat bread from Arnold and the 100% Whole Wheat bread from Pepperidge Farm also include soybean oil, monoglycerides, and DATEM. Buyer beware.There is just a lot of junk in mass-produced bread these days, even in the supposed \u201chealthy\u201d stuff. It is affecting the way that we feel on a daily basis and impacting our long-term health.I believe over-processing and unhealthy additives are to blame for the spike in \u201cgluten sensitivity\u201d in recent years, and not actually the gluten itself (excluding the small percentage of people who have Celiac disease). Gluten gets a bad rap, but we should really be looking elsewhere.But instead of obsessing over all of the bad stuff that is put into our bread, and how it\u2019s making us sick and tired, I\u2019ll instead focus on the type of bread we actually should be eating.For starters, aim to get as close to the original recipe for bread as possible. If you can find bread with only the four original ingredients (flour, yeast, water, salt) \u2014 or close to it \u2014 you\u2019re well on your way.If you can buy that bread from the person who actually baked it (and can tell you how they baked it), that\u2019s even better.But you also want to make sure that the flour used has not been bleached, refined, or \u201cenriched\u201d \u2014 which is typical in most commercial bread today \u2014 otherwise the nutrition content has already been stripped out. Enriched white flour causes your blood sugar to spike, and can lead to weight gain and a range of diet-related diseases.On the other hand, true whole grains (those not bleached, refined, or enriched) are nutrient-dense, keep you full longer, and have a milder effect on blood sugar.We know that whole grains are healthier than white flour, but we also know that the front of bread packaging cannot be trusted. Words like multigrain, whole grain, and whole wheat show up on nearly every package of bread these days, and it is very misleading.Instead, you need to look on the back of the label and perform some basic math to ensure you are really getting whole grains without the additives.Specifically, look at the label and make sure the serving size ratio of carbs to fiber is equal to or less than 5-to-1 (for example, if you divided 15 grams of carbs by 3 grams of fiber, that would equal 5 and would be acceptable). Authentic whole grain bread is naturally high in fiber because the wheat germ and bran are still included.Following the 5-to-1 rule is the way to buy healthy bread, according to Dr. Michael Greger, author of the groundbreaking book How Not To Die.I am a big fan of the Ezekiel 4:9 sprouted whole grain bread from the Food For Life brand. The low sodium version of that bread is arguably the healthiest bread in the grocery store.With 15 grams of carbs and 3 grams of fiber, Ezekiel 4:9 bread passes the health test. The science on the potential benefits of sprouted grains is still in its early stages, but available data points to many health benefits.Mack\u2019s Flax bread from Silver Hills Bakery is another tasty and approved option (18g Carbs, 5g Fiber, 3.6 ratio).Eating just 3 portions of whole grains a day (equivalent to 3 slices of the above approved breads) appears to be as powerful as high blood pressure medications in alleviating hypertension.Just 3 portions of whole grains have been shown to reduce the risk of getting a heart attack by 15%, and the risk of getting a stroke by about 25%.In case you are wondering, none of the \u201coffending\u201d breads mentioned in the previous section pass the 5-to-1 test. Wonder Bread Classic White (29g Carbs, 2g Fiber, 14.5 ratio), Nature\u2019s Own Honey Wheat (14g Carbs, less than 1g Fiber, 14 ratio), Pepperidge Farm 100% Whole Wheat (23g Carbs, 3g Fiber, 7.6 ratio), and Arnold 100% Whole Wheat (22g Carbs, 3g Fiber, 7.3 ratio) all clock in with more than a 7-to-1 ratio of carbs to dietary fiber. Some are better than others, but all should be avoided in favor of healthier options.I choose to eat my Ezekiel 4:9 morning toast with olive oil, which has also been shown to have a range of health benefits.Another option for healthy bread is to do as the Ikarians do.You may have heard that Ikaria, Greece is one of the world\u2019s Blue Zones \u2014 the places around the world with the highest life expectancy. Ikaria has been called the island where people forget to die. Residents of Ikaria stay healthy into their 90s and 100s with very little risk of Alzheimer\u2019s, dementia, or any other diseases of old age.Ikarians eat true sourdough bread that does not contain bakers yeast. Instead, their sourdough bread utilizes a lactobacilli (a beneficial strain of naturally-occurring bacteria) based starter culture, which \u201cdigests\u201d the starches and glutens while making the bread rise. This process creates an acid that gives sourdough its slightly sour taste. The resulting bread actually has less gluten than even breads labeled \u201cgluten free,\u201d and has a naturally longer shelf life. True sourdough bread is slow-burning and nutrient-rich.However, most \u201csourdough\u201d breads found in stores are actually fakes, containing yeast and\/or a sweetener. Go to your local bakery or grocery store and ask how they make their sourdough to ensure you get the real thing (made from real sourdough starter instead of yeast). Or bake your own Ikarian-style sourdough bread using this Blue Zones recipe.The bottom line is that bread can play an important role in your diet, but you have to pay close attention and select wisely.Choose bread with the fewest number of ingredients (ideally baked fresh, locally).Make sure you are getting nutrient-dense 100% whole grain bread by following the 5-to-1 carbs-to-fiber rule.Or opt for true sourdough bread like the centenarians in Ikaria eat.Follow these simple rules and you can continue enjoying all of the pleasures of bread without the negative health consequences.Written byWritten by","9848":"The social, mental and physical environments in which we work play a critical yet largely under appreciated role in our overall well being. 30% of founders suffer from depression and 27% suffer from problematic anxiety.

Almost a third of failed startups cite mental health issues as a key to their failure.While the medical community still hasn\u2019t caught up with this, Soulscape, an ethical travel company based in London has joined forces with San Francisco based, Project Atlas, a support program for the emotional, mental, and physical health of founders, entrepreneurs and leaders to offer immersive travel expeditions to prevent burnout and grow resiliency.Project Atlas\u2019 Founder Support program was recently launched by Silicon Valley venture firm, Alpha Bridge Ventures whose mantra \u201chealthy founder, healthy returns\u201d speaks of how managing partners, Howie Diamond and Jake Chapman instil the belief that founders of a company should be supported in the same way as athletes.Manjul Rathee, founder of Soulscape and award winning social entrepreneur says; \u201cWhen you\u2019re responsible for the success and leadership of a company, it\u2019s impossible not to lose yourself in your work \u2014 your brain is constantly wired.\u201dRathee who is also a co-founder to several other socials-ventures herself has been on the brink of burnout during various stages of her own career. \u201cFounders are too often willing to put their own well being on the back burner, until they burnout, give up or damage personal relationships. Everyone is telling you to take a break, but there\u2019s an underlying culture of setting high expectations and then feeling guilty if you\u2019re not working hard enough and that needs to change. It\u2019s easy to forget that people run companies, not robots, and the biggest asset to your company\u2019s success is you.\u201dKari Sulenes, founder of Atlas observes in herself and her clients, \u201cMany entrepreneurs know that taking time away helps them to slow down in a way that ultimately speeds them up, but again and again people say they will skip the trip because they can\u2019t turn off their brains or they\u2019ve come to believe that, if they take a moment away, everything will implode! What I\u2019ve noticed is companies, especially in their growth stages, failing because of people problems. As the founder or sole (and also soul) contributor to your business, taking time to get perspective, level-up and build a supportive community is key to avoid your own person-related issues. For those who are naturally curious and require variety, intentional and creative travel is vital to increasing energy and staying on your competitive edge.\u201dThere is increasing research around how taking part in creative endeavours nurtures different areas of the brain in new ways, with data suggesting that engaging in creative tasks improves brain function by promoting the production of new neurons \u2014 crucial for maintaining a healthy central nervous system. Combine that with experiences of new cultures which not only helps develop key areas of the brain involved in language and reasoning but also provides the opportunity to learn and become more empathic.Soulscape curates creative expeditions in lesser known parts of the world that fuse creative learning, cultural exploration and wellbeing to deliver immersive and transformative experiences whilst supporting local economies through ethical tourism. The partnership aims to provide select professionals with access to 1 to 1 coaching from a Project Atlas coach, before, during and after their Soulscape experience in Santiniketan, a UNESCO heritage site in West Bengal, India.The first Leadership Expedition is scheduled for 16\u201324 February 2019 and is limited to 8 participants.Learn more about Soulscape: https:\/\/tosoulscape.com\/leadership-developmentLearn more about Project Atlas: https:\/\/www.atlasq.com\/travelOriginally published at tosoulscape.com on November 11, 2018.In each issue we cover all things awesome in the markets, economy, crypto, tech, and more!\u00a0Take a lookCreate a free Medium account to get DDI Highlights in your inbox.Written byWritten by","9888":"Once upon a time I lived in India for three years. Two years ago I left. Then, this week, I went back for the first time.Coming back to India made me think about how, when I was living here, the lifestyle in India was normal to me.The constant noise everywhere, the overwhelming smells, the air pollution, the poverty staring you in the face.When I first moved here these things bitch slapped me into awareness. But then over time, I became desensitized to it all.It became normal for me.Over time as I settled in and saw the same things on a day to day basis, this gradually became my new normal. It became comfortable. Familiar.It made me think about how we can \u201cnormalize\u201d nearly anything in life if we practice it enough.Do something enough times and it will eventually feel like second nature.At first it might feel unfamiliar, uncomfortable, strange, foreign \u2014 but if we practice it enough, these feelings eventually fade into the background.Another great example of this for me has been the Slackline.The first time you step on a Slackline it shakes \u2014 violently. You try to stand up on it and your body doesn\u2019t know how to react. You freeze, tighten up, and fall off. It\u2019s such an unfamiliar and strange feeling that your body freaks out.BUT over time as you repeatedly step onto it, your body becomes more familiar with the sensation of violently shaking. Your body starts to calm down, and you can gradually learn the movements required to stay on the line and start taking your first steps.The more you practice, the more normal it becomes, and the more progress you can make.This concept of \u201cnormalization\u201d made me think about all of the other areas of my lifestyle that have become normalized over time.All of the flights that I take, and how bouncing around the world like a ping pong ball has become normal to me.All of the cultures I\u2019ve lived in, and how being surrounded by foreign languages has become normal to me.Working outside of an office, and how the feeling of being in an office suffocates me \u2014 because I have NOT normalized the feelings of being in an office.It\u2019s made me start asking myself the question \u2014 \u201cis this uncomfortable for me because I genuinely don\u2019t like it, or is it merely because I haven\u2019t normalized it?\u201dTake for example spending money. For the vast majority of us, our financial lives don\u2019t rapidly change overnight. This means that what you spend your money on, and how much you spend\/save of it, and your feelings around money, will largely remain consistent for the foreseeable future.Therefore when you go out to an expensive dinner\/trip\/party that is outside the norm of your current spending habits, you will probably worry about it and feel uncomfortable (I know I used to!)Now instead I ask myself, \u201cis this actually too expensive for me, or am I not used to spending this much?\u201dMost of the time when I ask myself this question I realize that I CAN afford to spend the money, I\u2019m just not used to it.For this reason, I\u2019ve recently started to intentionally spend more than I am used to, in order to normalize a better quality of life for myself.I\u2019m more willing to spend money on things that will bring me happiness, so that spending money on things that make me happy becomes my new normal.Building on this tangent, I\u2019ve talked in the past about cultivating your \u201cdefault\u201d mode \u2014 aka what does your \u201cnormal\u201d mood look like on a daily basis?In the same way that we can normalize activities and parts of our lifestyle, we can also normalize different moods and emotions for ourselves\u2026.for good and for bad.We can normalize depression. We can normalize anxiety. We can normalize sadness.I genuinely believe that for many of the people who suffer from these emotions, it\u2019s because they have accidentally NORMALIZED being depressed\/anxious\/sad!!!They have consistently experienced this emotion day in day out over an extended period of time, and in doing so, made this their reality. They don\u2019t see anything wrong with it because it\u2019s normal. Nothing is out of the ordinary.Take for example the founder who is always stressed out and anxious while working but claims they love what they do. This person doesn\u2019t realize how stressed and anxious they are because this is their normal. He\/she has been like this for so long that they don\u2019t see the root cause of the problem.But just because it\u2019s normal, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good for you. You may have \u201cnormalized\u201d a sub-par style of life. You may have normalized negative emotions. You might accept that this is your reality because you don\u2019t realize the momentum you have built for yourself.So instead what can we do? Practice the emotions we want to experience.We can normalize happiness. We can normalize gratitude. We can normalize patience. We can normalize love.But it takes practice. It takes conscious effort. It takes consistency of doing the same things every day over an extended period of time.At first this will feel strange, unfamiliar, uncomfortable even. That\u2019s just because it\u2019s not normal to you yet. If you keep doing it, you can normalize it.We can normalize anything that we want to in life, both good and bad. Every day is a conscious choice of becoming aware of the habits we have normalized and either continuing to strengthen those habits, or choosing new ones instead.Make happy your new normal. Make gratitude your new normal. Make a beautiful life where you expect magic to happen on a daily basis your new normal\u2026.because everyone deserves it, whether you have normalized it or not \ud83d\ude09Originally published at Troy Erstling.Communicate with me: Facebook \/ Instagram \/ YoutubeOther articles you will enjoy from me:Written byWritten by","9892":"Normal Follicular DevelopmentThe most iconic feature of PCOS and what the syndrome is named for \u2014 is the presence of the multiple cysts on the ovary. Many women have a few cysts on their ovary, but the sheer number of cysts distinguishes this syndrome from virtually all others. Almost no other human disease causes polycystic ovaries. These cysts develop from a group of cells known as follicles.Normal ovaries are endowed at birth with a finite pool of primordial follicles, which have the potential to develop into a mature egg. Primordial follicles remain quiescent for many years until recruited for growth into a primary follicle during the menstrual cycle. From birth to menarche, all primordial follicles remain dormant. Follicle numbers gradually decrease with age as used follicles are never replaced. When the follicles are fully depleted, women undergo menopause and can no longer have children.At the start of each menstrual cycle, a few primordial follicles grow into primary and then secondary follicles. Only one of these follicles is selected to become the dominant follicle and the rest simply shrivel away (involute) and are reabsorbed by the body. The dominant follicle alone continues to grow. At ovulation, in response to a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH), the egg is expelled into the respective fallopian tube which carries it to the uterus. The rest of the dominant follicle becomes the corpus luteum, which secretes estrogen and progesterone to support the hoped-for pregnancy.Primary follicles are generally detectable by ultrasound when they reach 2mm in size. The key growth signal for the primary follicle is testosterone. Insulin is important, too, but acts indirectly by increasing testosterone. The dominant follicle typically measures 22\u201324 mm.While the follicle is growing, the lining of the uterus thickens in preparation for egg since it must supply all the necessary nutrients to await arrival of the sperm. If the sperm makes contact and fertilization occurs (yeah, baby), then the uterus continues to increase its growth to sustain the growing fetus. This is the missed period which often signals a normal pregnancy. If the sperm (working late at the office) never arrives, then the egg cannot wait forever. The lining of the uterus is shed, along with the discarded egg, and a woman\u2019s period begins. Typically, this happens once a month.The normal maturation process from primordial to primary to dominant follicles and then ovulation is quite orderly. Consider an analogy \u2014 a school where children start at kindergarten and gradually grow up to graduate high school. Each year they progress in an orderly fashion until, at the end of high school, the student is pushed out into the real world. The follicles, like the kindergarten students start young and grow up in an orderly fashion until finally, when mature, the egg is pushed out into the fallopian tube (ovulation) to await the sperm for fertilization.Follicular ArrestIn women with PCOS, this entire process of maturation goes awry. In 1982, it was first observed that PCOS ovaries contain 2\u20133 times the number of small primary follicles measuring 2\u20135 mm with more recent studies suggesting up to six times the normal number. Too many primordial follicles were forced from the resting phase to become primary follicles, driven by high testosterone levels. With a finite number of primordial follicles, premature depletion may cause premature menopause.This situation is seen not just in PCOS, but anytime testosterone is excessive since the small ovarian follicles are rich in testosterone receptors. Experiments in rhesus monkeys, for example, show that administering high testosterone doses increases the number of primary follicles by 3 to 5-fold. In humans, exogenous testosterone given to female-to-male transsexuals has the same effect. Rare testosterone secreting adrenal tumors cause the same abnormally high number of small follicles. There is a tight relationship between blood levels of testosterone and the number of follicles detected by ultrasound.Insulin acts indirectly by increasing testosterone levels but also directly on the ovary to promote this transition from primordial to primary follicle. This is important, because women with PCOS have significantly higher insulin levels than predicted by BMI alone.The problems don\u2019t stop there. There are too many primary follicles, but no single dominant follicle is selected to continue growing, which is the normal signal for the others to involute. These large numbers of small follicles don\u2019t shrivel up when they\u2019re supposed to, eventually becoming cystic and then visible as polycystic ovaries. This failure of maturation of the follicles is called follicular arrest.Consider our schoolchild analogy. In PCOS, there are too many follicles starting the transition from quiescent primordial follicle to growing primary follicle. But these follicles never grow up and they never shrivel up either. It is analogous to starting six times the number of students at kindergarten. But these students all stop their studies at grade 6 and never move past that stage. There are simply a huge number of grade 6 students just milling about the school. In PCOS, there are too many small follicles that do not mature to become eggs that can be pushed out into the uterus for fertilization. This failure of ovulation causes the anovulatory cycles and menstrual irregularities. The excessive numbers of small follicles are visible as polycystic ovaries.High insulin levels are predominantly responsible for the follicular arrest by disturbing the delicate balance of FSH to LH ratio that triggers the correct follicular development. During normal development, a surge of LH selects the dominant follicle which leads to proper ovulation. The high insulin levels make the follicle too sensitive to LH so they respond too early in the menstrual cycle, when they are not yet ready for ovulation.As the small follicles stop growing, no single dominant follicle is selected and there is no signal for involution. Hence, too many small follicles cannot grow any further so they simply accumulate fluid and become cystic. This becomes visible on ultrasound as numerous small fluid filled cysts clinching the diagnosis of PCOS. The reason for the development of polycystic ovaries is follicular arrest, which is ultimately caused by too much insulin.Going back to our analogy of students, imagine a graduation letter is normally sent to students in grade 12 to stop school, so they can join the workforce or go to university. If these graduation letters are sent to students in grade 6, they will stop school but they are not yet ready either. No students eventually progress to leave high school and neither do they drop out of school. Therefore, they just mill about the school.In the PCOS situation, insulin sends this \u2018stop growing\u2019 message to the follicles much too early. These follicles, not yet mature cannot be either expelled as mature eggs, and cannot involute (shrivel up). Eventually they just become cysts. Lots and lots of cysts.The eponymous criteria of PCOS are the presence of multiple cysts in the ovaries, which are derived from the multitude of small follicles. But ultimately, these polycystic ovaries are caused by too much insulin and too much testosterone. Both the cysts and the hyperandrogenism are caused by the same underlying problem \u2014 too much insulin. What about the other major criteria \u2014 the irregular menstrual cycles?Written byWritten by","9902":"I imagine Heaven is a place without fear. An angel\u2019s wings are purely decorative but that doesn\u2019t stop them from diving off clouds. (Seraphim bounce.) Angels love and are loved, without condition. They\u2019re like Labrador Retrievers that way. Angels never get laid off, or dumped, or fear harm. Angels are never in danger.Immortality is boring, but it\u2019s secure.Sadly, I am mortal and death swipes left on us all. I am constantly worried about what comes next. Who I am. What I should do. Whether or not I should roll the dice or just eat grocery store sushi rolls. I want to be brave. I need to be brave. I want to be remembered for never shirking a righteous battle. I hope I am. Fortune favors the bold and, therefore, roots for the brave.I am no hero, but I know a little about bravery. I\u2019ve seen it. I know heroes. I\u2019ve met them. They are as surprised as anyone that they did what they did. Whether it was daring to dream, or ignoring odds, or wiping a feverish forehead and whispering \u201cyou\u2019re going to get better\u201d when the truth was the doctors didn\u2019t know if they would.The first step is simple: be afraid. It\u2019s not that hard, really. Life is a buffet of fears: flying, grey hairs, spiders. There are monsters under the bed and in the closet and on Twitter. Take your pick. In order to be brave, you must first accept that you are not brave. No one is, until the moment they are given the choice.So let\u2019s talk about that moment. That nanosecond before you choose to do the scary thing even though you are scared. Do you tell them you love them? Ask for that promotion? Trust your instincts? That seemingly endless instant is called courage. And there\u2019s a small difference between bravery and courage.Fear wants to protect you, even from the good things in life.Courage is facing an impossible obstacle even though it is frightening. It is being strong when one is weak. It is wobbly knees while waiting for a roller coaster. The rear door of a truck crashing closed before beginning a life-changing move. A tea kettle whistling before a conversation with a family member about who you truly are inside. Courage is the fuel that gets you to that collection of heartbeats when a decision is made.Courage carries you to the proverbial precipice. To jump, or not to jump. But bravery is deciding to take the plunge, no matter the risk. Bravery is failing or flying. Standing up for yourself, or someone else, despite what may happen next. Bravery is taking one step forward, then two. As many as it takes.There are real dangers in life. As President Charles Xavier once said, the only thing to fear is fear itself, and ebola. And mass shootings. And your next-door neighbor. Bravery isn\u2019t kicking a rattlesnake. But fear doesn\u2019t always know the difference between a diamondback and rejection, or heartbreak, or self-doubt. Fear wants to protect you, even from the good things in life. Fear doesn\u2019t want you to bruise, emotionally, or physically. Bravery is being so present, so in your own living skin, that you can manage that fear and live.I have not always been a brave person. I am personally terrified of singing karaoke, speaking up for myself, and the grim reaper. I can confirm, though, that the only true miracles of my life happened when I was brave. When I did the right thing for myself, and others, and didn\u2019t care what happened. There have been times in my life when I jumped out of a metaphorical plane because I knew that love is a parachute. (My fear of flying extends to a fear of actually skydiving, but it\u2019s at the bottom of my long bucket list.)Here\u2019s step two: feel what you\u2019re feeling. Say a kind word to your reflection. Trust your heart. Close your eyes, and open them. Your hands are your grandparent's hands and they are strong. Let courage push you towards changing your life in small and big ways. And when you are presented with a choice \u2014 start over or stay, follow your dreams or settle, be who you are, not who you are expected to be \u2014 say \u2018yes\u2019 to the scary one. In the end, you\u2019ll be thankful for all the times you said \u2018yes.\u2019I actually don\u2019t know if I believe in an afterlife or angels, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s absurd to think that, perhaps, somewhere, in another dimension or outside time, there is a vast celestial ledger and over it broods an ancient bookkeeper tallying up the sum total of atoms split to fuel a star, pebbles peppered across the face of Mars, giggles from all the toddlers. Every moon is counted. Every raindrop. Every small moment I enjoy in this life, every laugh, belch, every fresh peach, and cold autumn rain and early morning kiss is special and numbered.My every step, choice, hope, dream \u2014 tears shed, breaths taken, hugs given \u2014 will be recorded thusly. I do not know the purpose of this cosmic accounting book but I like to think, once the universe has imploded, everything will be added up. For eternal posterity. A final inventory of all the bits and pieces \u2014 the actions and consequences \u2014 of everything. And on that vast list of all the things that happened, it will be recorded that I was, on occasion, brave.Written byWritten by","9913":"Conclusions from 20+ interviews carried out with the brightest minds of the Kairos Europe Summit with advice on impact on an internal and external level.Last October I attended the Kairos Europe Summit, an event where top entrepreneurs tackle global issues. During this three-day event, I spent my time asking everyone around this question: \u201cWhat would be your one advice, something one can take as a daily habit, to contribute to making the world a better place?\u201dI wanted to do it because I ask myself this question everyday and we\u2019re leaning more & more towards \u201cindividual responsibility\u201d to solve the challenges we\u2019re facing (vs. governments for example).Here are some of the answers and the insights I got from it:\u201c Rather than have an expectation of the world delivering you with a solution, be willing to go out on a limb, on your own path of discovery.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s basically the amount of time that you have in your career. It is a great resource to make career choices while contributing to some of the world\u2019s most pressing problems.\u201d\u201cI think that education is the way to start and to scale, so spending time on reflecting and reforming the way we educate is a definitive first start.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll quote one of my teachers Uri Levine: it\u2019s easy for us to fall in love with our solution and not spend enough time to define the problem. Also, try to shift your lens from others\u2019 perspective.\u201d\u201cThe key is to understand that everything in our world is a system made of systems. People have tried to solve problems with a linear lateral siloed approach and few of them have been successful. But if you take that complex system approach, you\u2019re bound for success.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the Kairos EU slogan. Think big, boldly and take risks. Approach everything you dream of as if it was possible. Serendipity happens eventually \u2014 it\u2019s just a function of time and persistency.\u201cI think it\u2019s having this drive to really just dream big and go forward. Don\u2019t hold back. Find others who inspire you, learn about them and learn from them.\u201d\u201cFamily, friends, the relationships that really make life worth living. Everything else is just a way to achieve this.\u201d\u201cThink of the person that you have in front of you. You can do a lot of things, but this little thing, smiling to your coworkers, someone on the bus\u2026 These good vibes make a difference, they make the world greater.\u201d\u201cClean up your own room and close environment. If everyone was picking the trash in front of the door there would be no trash. That\u2019s the easiest advice I can give to anyone: contribute just a little to the community.\u201dTry to understand what you are doing & how you\u2019re affecting the world. Always ask yourself if you\u2019re doing it for yourself, your ego, or if it actually is really something that pushes the world forward and solves problems. Where is your power directed to?\u201cThe single greatest thing to change my life was adopting a morning ritual. It consists of breathing, practicing meditation, and writing down as well as feeling into everything I have to be grateful for.\u201dSo, what can we take from that?Did you notice anything about the order I picked to show the answers?Go back up and take 20 seconds to think \u2026They go from things you can do outside of yourself to inside yourself. They also have a local to an \u201cat-scale\u201d impactWhich brings me to this quote I really love and I think is one of the true keys to help the world move towards the right direction:Bonus, here\u2019s mine :)\u201cI truly think we could have a big impact on the 17 UN SDGs** by teaching everyone the basics of breathing correctly & meditation from a young age.\u201d* The Kairos EU Summit is an event that brings together 150 of the brightest entrepreneurs and 50 of the world\u2019s most influential industry leaders.

You\u2019ve drifted out to sea.Luckily, you have your paddles with you\u2026but now it\u2019s going to take a lot of time, energy, and effort to get your ass back home.How could we have prevented this from happening in the first place?Yes, the simple act of putting an anchor down could have prevented you from drifting out to sea. If your boat began to drift, the anchor would have caught you and saved you all the time and energy of having to get back to shore.Similarly in life, I believe that when the storms of life make us drift out to sea, we can use anchors to return back to the shores of presence.We can use positive habits of presence, mindfulness, and gratitude as the anchors that bring us back to ourselves when we have gotten lost in the seas of our mind.If you have ever tried to meditate, you are probably familiar with what is widely called the \u201cmonkey mind\u201d \u2014 a mind that constantly jumps from thought to thought while you\u2019re trying to be aware of your breathing.And if you\u2019re familiar with this, it means you\u2019re familiar with being lost in your own mind. Wrapped up in the stories and thoughts and ideas that seem to flow in a never ending stream of consciousness.In meditation when the mind is lost like this, the practice is to notice that you are lost in thought, and then return back to the breath.Attention to breath>mind wanders>mind notices it has wandered>bring it back to the breath.In this scenario, the breath becomes an anchor to your present moment. When you\u2019re lost in the sea of your mind, the breath becomes an anchor to return home to shore.Similarly, we can use the breath as an anchor throughout our day \u2014 away from the meditation cushion and in our natural daily stress (and joy!) filled lives.Someone aggravates you at work and you\u2019re lost in a sea of rage? Take a deep breath and try to get control over your boat.Someone says something to you that hurts and leaves you in a spiral of depression? Take a deep breath and try to get control over your boat.Keep in mind however that depending on how far you have drifted out to sea, it will take that much more effort to get back.If you\u2019ve only been lost at sea momentarily, within one breath you could be quickly back to shore.If you\u2019ve been swirling in the seas of insanity for some time, you\u2019re probably going to need a lot of breaths. You might make some progress getting home, and then drift back out again. Two steps forward, one step back kind of thing.And that\u2019s fine! As long as the anchor is doing what it needs to, as long as the anchor is pulling you back home, it\u2019s doing it\u2019s job.Anchoring is not limited to the breath. In meditation there are a variety of techniques you can use to anchor yourself to the present moment. Some of the most common ones include the breath, feelings in the body, and sounds around you.Anchors can come in many forms, and you can have as many of them as you want!Here are some of my favorite examples\u2026Pause! Stop whatever you are doing, take a few deep breaths, and give yourself a break for a few minutes. (No, that doesn\u2019t mean check social media) Go outside, take a few deep breaths. Pay attention to your mood and how you\u2019re feeling. Stare up at the sky. Close your eyes and listen to the sounds around you.By taking a pause in our day we give ourselves the opportunity to let go of what recently happened and create space for what is yet to come. We come back to the present moment for a brief second.It allows us to escape the seas that we have been swimming in all day and get a breath of fresh air. To stop, recognize how you\u2019re feeling, take a deep breath, and re-calibrate your energy before you go back into your work.I personally find that the best way to get out of my head is to get into my body. To reconnect with my feelings and the energy flowing inside of me. That\u2019s why, one of my favorite anchors to the present moment is the physical connection to the body.How can we apply this? The most basic form is exercise of some kind. Something to get your heart pumping quickly, but not enough to qualify as a full workout. For me this usually means a few pushups, jumping jacks, running in place for a minute, or some light stretching.The point here is to pay attention to how your body feels. The more you can feel your body and make that \u201cmind-muscle connection\u201d, the better you will be at getting outside of your head and returning back to the present moment.Out of all the things I\u2019ve learned throughout my journey of meditation, gratitude and appreciation seem to be the holy grail of all spiritual practices. When life has you spinning \u2014 anchor yourself to the things that you are most grateful for in life.I always like to start with my health, as I find it\u2019s the thing we most often take for granted. Thank your lungs for breathing constantly so that you don\u2019t have to. Thank your heart for pumping blood throughout your body and keeping you alive.Thank your mind for solving problems for you and giving you a computer inside of your brain that provides you with the ability to do work in the first place!Another exercise I like is to think of a specific memory that brings a smile to your face. Think of a time when you were at your happiest. Visualize it. FEEL it. Feel the emotions it brings to you. Visualize all of the events that took place as if you\u2019re watching a movie and the scenes are flying by one by one.I can\u2019t stress this one enough. Of all the anchors, gratitude is hands down the most powerful. Anchor yourself in gratitude and appreciation and it\u2019s unlikely that the seas of life will ever take you off course.Let\u2019s say that you\u2019ve drifted out to sea because of something that another PERSON did to you. Maybe it was a boss, a co-worker, a family member \u2014 regardless of who the person is\u2026they did something and now you are upset.In times like these, similar to the above point of gratitude, are there any positive memories that you have shared with this person? Are there any ways that they have made you a stronger, tougher person?If you can, try to anchor yourself to those positive memories that you have shared together. Try to remember how this person has helped you become a better version of yourself. Try to get away from the situation that made you upset, and remember that this is another human being with emotions just like you, and we\u2019re all sometimes victim of drifting out to sea.If this doesn\u2019t work \u2014 try to use the Dhalai Lama analogy of \u201cis this person 100% bad?\u201dAre their eyes bad? Their hair? Their feet?!Sounds ridiculous, but in the moment it\u2019s easy to get wrapped up and think that every aspect of this person is bad or evil\u2026.but they aren\u2019t. They are a person too. Sometimes it helps to remember that they are not a bad person, they might just have some bad qualities.Initially these anchors help you to RETURN to yourself. To find yourself once again. To return back to the present moment when you have been lost in your own mind.The beauty of this technique however, is that over time these anchors PREVENT you from drifting out to sea in the first place.Anchoring can become a stable, foundational practice that keeps you tied to the present moment. Keeps you here in the now. Prevents you from getting lost at sea.Anchor yourself to your breath, to your bodily feelings, to appreciation and gratitude, and to positive memories with the people you love who have helped you to become who you are today.Anchor yourself to love. Love for yourself. Love for the people around you. And love for the entire universe that brought you into existence.Anchor yourself to the now for a beautiful life where you can peacefully enjoy the seas at ease :)Communicate with me: Facebook \/ Instagram \/ YoutubeOther articles you will enjoy from me:Originally published at Troy Erstling.Written byWritten by","10035":"After fifteen years of shame and violation, I\u2019m talking \u2014 and forgiving.July 6th marked my twelfth series of cervical biopsies. I\u2019ve had so many, it\u2019s surprising I\u2019ve kept count.When I was still anxious and depressed a few days post-op, I scoffed. How could I, whose surgery anecdotes once made an ER nurse dry heave, be upset?As always, my \u201cthing\u201d was under control. I was back in weekly talk therapy. I\u2019d even joined a survivors\u2019 forum, reliving my disease as I dispensed wisdom for the cause. Whenever 19-year-olds posted about hysterectomies and funerals, I assured them with peer-reviewed journals and emojis that they\u2019d be fine.Even though my odds weren\u2019t so hot, I wasn\u2019t bitter. I was educated and resilient \u2014 a one-woman Pussy Riot. I was Xena-Buffy-Okoye, a triumphant warrior whose eyeliner stayed flawless while roundhouse kicking deadly viruses in the goddamn face.I was so awesome that I made it a whole week after those July biopsies before collapsing in a blubbering snot heap.After a tearful month of accomplishing nothing, I hit my breaking point. I asked Dr. M., my potty-mouthed yogini therapist\/human version of a Mystic from The Dark Crystal, \u201cWhere has badass Beth gone?\u201dDr. M. pondered for a moment before sagely replying, \u201cYou\u2019re still holding on to the shame, dear one.\u201dMy face Kermit-scrunched with disbelief. We were talking about me, right? The one who puts her foot in her mouth thrice daily and throws casual TMI bombs as icebreakers at parties?Besides, I couldn\u2019t be ashamed if I\u2019d said things like:It wasn\u2019t until one random sleepless night that the answer hit me. Something was wrong \u2014 with way more than just my cervix.For years, I\u2019d justified keeping mum about my disease. Talking about cervixes and vaginas intimidates folks. A squeamish person might faint on concrete. And, number one: No one wants to hear about problems they can\u2019t relate to.It took finally imploding for me to see my excuses for the bullshit they were.In hindsight, my silence was neither brave nor productive. While I outwardly projected hope, my rage at doctors, at myself, and at the world simmered below the surface. Euphemisms like \u201clady parts\u201d or \u201csomething wrong\u201d didn\u2019t convey my humiliation and despair.Instead of a strong woman who protected others, I was a coward You-Know-Whoing my Voldemort. I was protecting myself and my shame.So, for me, and for my sisters out there crying silently at their keyboards, I\u2019m sharing my story. If it helps just one person, my sacrifice to the Shame Gods will be worth it.The early 2000s were oxymoronic, sexually speaking. Xtina and whale tail were cool, but gayness was still \u201cscary.\u201d Missy told us to \u201cWork It,\u201d but teen pregnancies were still common. School curricula were still mostly the Pill, condoms, AIDS, and a dash of chlamydia for flavor.It wasn\u2019t common knowledge yet that almost all sexually active adults contract HPV. To boot, Gardisil, the preventative vaccine for the deadliest strains, didn\u2019t hit the market until 2006. There were no BuzzFeed articles about how much living with HPV sucked.Compounding matters, I grew up super Catholic. My mom was still trying to bless me with oils and relics long after I was making salt circles and smudging my bedroom. You had to be puking blood to miss Mass, and my curfew was embarrasingly early.Needless to say, STIs weren\u2019t up for discussion.If this was a Lifetime movie, the script would be plaid-skirt-gone-wild, validating the misconception that HPV is a \u201cho disease.\u201d Sorry to be boring, but I wasn\u2019t promiscuous.I got my first Papanicolaou smear (Pap) after my eighteenth birthday in 2004. It was a non-event to the point that I wondered what all the fuss was about.That all changed when I got my results. According to my letter, my Pap had detected a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL).When I called the office, the nurse said I had \u201cdysplasia.\u201d It meant I needed a colposcopy, a closer examination of the cervix with a vaginascope-thingy. If they saw abnormal tissue, they\u2019d take some small biopsies.At the time, I vaguely knew that a \u201cbad\u201d Pap was related to cervical cancer. No one said anything about HPV.When I arrived for the procedure, I scoped out the tools. There, gleaming on a sterile pad was a large, scissors-like implement, which I\u2019ve since affectionately dubbed the Hole Puncher.Despite my terror, especially because there was no anesthesia, my physician said they\u2019d be only \u201clittle pinches.\u201d To my relief, she was right. Even when she misfired on the second punch and I bled a ton, I got over it. Senior Week was imminent, and I had Britney-rise lace up jeans to flaunt.When the results came back, I was ecsatic. The biopsies were only low-grade bad cells (CIN 1), and the margins, a.k.a. edges of the tissue, were clear. This meant that they\u2019d likely excised all the tissue causing the bad Pap.Other than a repeat test in six months, I was free. In my genius teenage brain, it also meant I was cured.My next gynecologist (that bad punch had made me nervous) was a kind, middle-aged guy who seemed like he had everything under control. He seemed to be confident that I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with HPV again.The letdown stung more than I thought it would. The Pap came back LSIL again, a.k.a. not cured.After my second date with the Hole Puncher, again I waited. Again, low-grade\/CIN 1 with clear margins. Again, no cancer.And again, I shrugged it off. I was young and otherwise healthy. There was no reason to think the second time wouldn\u2019t be the charm.My 20s started off rough. I didn\u2019t get my next Pap until age 23, after a several-year break. I rationalized a little hooky since my body had probably already cleared the virus on its own.Turns out that my gyno vacation was a bust. LSIL once again.Due to insurance, I switched to my third gynecologist for the colposcopy and biopsies. Though I was happy she was female, I wasn\u2019t happy that she pruned my cervix like an overgrown hedge. By the fifth clack, I saw stars.By the eighth, I was ready to lose breakfast.After enduring a gross and traumatic infection \u2014 eight pieces is a lot \u2014 I got the call. If you guessed CIN 1, clear margins, and no cancer, you win.Instead of relieved, I was annoyed. As many as 90 percent of people kick their active HPV infections within two years.I was already at six and counting.When my next follow-up arrived, I was determined to end the nomadic gynecology. I booked my Pap at the county\u2019s largest practice.After only a few years, I\u2019d gone several more rounds of the now-usual wonky Paps and Hole Puncher. The only noteworthy development was that some of the pieces were CIN 2 instead of CIN 1. Even though I\u2019d been \u201cpromoted\u201d to moderate-grade dysplasia, it was still business as usual.Then, somewhere around my fifth colposcopy, my cervix got sassy. This time, the biopsies were CIN 3 \u2014 high grade dysplasia that\u2019s only a step away from cancer.Though CIN 3 isn\u2019t cancer and rarely becomes malignant, most gynecologists won\u2019t roll the dice. On their recommendation, I booked a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). It\u2019s a wire, heated by an electric current, that takes a thin slice of your cervix to remove precancerous or cancerous cells.As soon as I entered the \u201cspecial room\u201d the day of, I wasn\u2019t feeling the vibe. A team of four greeted me, the gynecological equivalent of a Madison Square Garden-sized audience.Once the speculum went in, I dutifully counted ceiling tiles. Injection one numbed the cervix with lidocaine, while the second was something \u2014 didn\u2019t catch the name \u2014 to prevent bleeding. Huge needles to the cervix are no picnic, but I dealt.The rest was a succession of hot, cold, and cramping. Something sounded like a dental drill. Still unfun, but manageable.I was very chill until, about five minutes in, my legs began shaking uncontrollably.It was only then, mid-panic, that I realized one of the nurses looked like John Stamos. \u201cCome on,\u201d my brain screeched. \u201cGet thy shit together!\u201dSuddenly, I was basted with a vaguely ghost-pepperish solution. It was over.I should have immediately started relaxing. People were puttering around and cleaning up. But since no one had commanded otherwise, I was still in position sans underwear, my leg jiggles wobbling everything else by proxy and my face burning like a fire-roasted tomato.Me (croaking): \u201cIs this normal?\u201dPhysician (not looking): \u201cIs what?\u201dMe: *Gestures to legs*Physician (finally looking): \u201cOh, yeah. I injected you with epinephrine.\u201dMe: \u201cLike\u2026adrenaline?\u201dPhysician: \u201cYup.\u201dMe: \u201cWill it stop soon?\u201dPhysician (back to not looking): \u201cShould.\u201d\u2026Thanks, jackwagon, for forewarning me that my flapping thunder thighs would haunt Uncle Jesse\u2019s dreams forever.Extreme embarrassment notwithstanding, I was optimistic. Most LEEPs prevent further dysplasia with a 90 percent success rate.I got another Pap six months later. As you may have guessed, no bueno.After a decade of frustration, I switched practices again. Luckily, my new gynecologist was warm, approachable, and interested. When I told her how things had been handled to date, her eyes narrowed.\u201cAre you planning on having children?\u201d she asked gently.I looked at her like she\u2019d sprouted a second head. Though I was getting married in a month, shrieking little bundles of life gave me agita. I hadn\u2019t even seen Chicago yet, for God\u2019s sake.When she explained that cervical procedures can impact fertility and the ability to carry a pregnancy, I was floored. Not one of my doctors had mentioned this consequence.As expected, the Pap was bad. What I didn\u2019t expect was the office to call me again to discuss something else entirely.Unbeknownst to me, half of my many Paps had co-tested me for HPV. The verdict: For at least 10 years, as my files corroborated, I\u2019d had at least one of the high-risk strains.You read correctly. Of the many board-certified gynecologists I\u2019d seen, none of them had said the tiny sentence I needed to hear:\u201cYou have HPV.\u201dBummed and diseased, I went for my next colposcopy. I leapt into the stirrups, expecting it to be like any other time.Silly me.I had no idea that after the LEEP, the formerly tolerable chunks taken out of my cervix would now entail walloping cramps on a five-second delay. After wiping my leaking eyes, I staggered out of the room, trying not to wobble as my vision went white. I barely made the ten-minute drive with my head on the steering wheel, praying I wouldn\u2019t vomit on myself.Each subsequent biopsy got worse. Hours beforehand, I\u2019d feel like I had to pee, constantly. During the procedure, my feet would go numb. I would shake. Up to a half hour post-op, I was still producing adrenaline like a fiend, my brain shouting, \u201cI swear, woman! They\u2019ve put the Hole Puncher away!\u201dIt took me 10 years to crack, but crack I did. I\u2019d finally succumbed to a good ole\u2019-fashioned case of PTSD.Eventually, my gynecologist admitted I was a perplexing case. She decided it was time for me to visit a gynecologic oncologist.Instead of hearing \u201concologist\u201d and freaking out like a normal person, I was relieved. Scary as cancer sounded, I didn\u2019t have it (yet). What I did have was someone who might actually know what the hell was going on.Most patients in the inviting, tea-scented waiting room were over 70. When I got a stare or two, the Frodo-Harry Potter-Jesus self-pity swelled within me. I was special in the worst way, with a One Ring-Horcrux-Cross case of HPV that was mine alone to bear.After waiting an hour, I was pretty cranxious. I had my RBF at the ready, expecting to be given five minutes by some overqualified fossil.Fortunately, instead of a crusty old dude, I got the guy who might save my life. I\u2019d say he had me at \u201cI just transferred from Johns Hopkins,\u201d but that would be lying. Dr. G. totally and superficially won my heart by rocking a bow tie and matching sneakers.He did my Pap, which hurt more than usual. When I asked why, he said he\u2019d be surprised if I wasn\u2019t in pain. For years, they\u2019d been cutting into scar tissue, most notably from the LEEP.\u201cHasn\u2019t anyone told you that?\u201d he inquired.I tried not to snort.Once the speculum was out, he started sketching. \u201cYou see,\u201d he said, squiggling two orbiting circles around a small one, \u201cIt\u2019s like a record.\u201dI blinked, unaware we\u2019d be playing Vag Pictionary. When he pointed toward the inner orbit, he drew an arrow into the tiny hole.\u201cIt\u2019s probably in the neck, the higher place of your cervix where they can\u2019t reach. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t catch it.\u201dDouble blink. Was I a giraffe now?\u2026and then\u2026\u201cHas anyone ever told you your cervix and vagina are completely to the left?\u201dA mouse\u2019s sneeze could have knocked me over. Apparently, the cervix, which I had thought was anchored by the vagina or some cool sorceress juju, is held in place by six ligaments. In the unlikely case HPV migrates there, things can get pulled westerly.It was an information barrage, so it took a few days to process. When I found a peer-reviewed journal about how common it is for dysplasia to inhabit the cervical canal (neck), I hurled my hairdryer at the wall.All this time, doctors had been omitting basic facts about my condition and my anatomy. At the very least, they were ignorant of the latest research. I\u2019d been driving blind at their mercy, with zero context with which to make decisions about my own body.When my Pap came back abnormal yet again, I was frustrated but let Dr. G. punch away. I guess you have to be pretty liberal when extracting cancer, because he wasn\u2019t gentle.Based on my history, he said I needed a cold-knife conization \u2014 yep: a cold knife slicing out a cone-shaped piece of tissue. Like the biopsy and LEEP, it would enable a diagnosis and remove tissue before it got cancery.It also meant something phenomenal. Because the dysplasia was in the neck, and because my scar tissue was making a gentle breeze hurt:After 12 years of pain and embarrassment, I was finally getting knocked out.When I woke up from the procedure, my doctor said it looked like they got everything. Even to the naked eye, it had seemed high-grade.Vindicated and feeling like I\u2019d been violated by a mountain troll, I went home. I ignored my husband\u2019s pleas to let him do the laundry, so recovery could have gone better.At my follow-up, Dr. G. got down to business. Due to changing guidelines, I wasn\u2019t supposed to come back for a year. He also cautioned that if I wanted to get pregnant, now would be the time.The news should have made me elated. After a year of marriage, I was warming to the notion of an adorable little screaming parasite. Considering what I\u2019d been through, pregnancy seemed miraculous.The reason I barely cared is probably because that first thing he\u2019d said was blaring in my mind like a sexy mariachi band: \u201cone year.\u201dA whole year without being violated.A whole year without more scarring.A whole year without that fucking Hole Puncher.It was a rare cause for a happy cry.I had every intention of returning for that Pap in one year. Really, I did.But, as happens when you\u2019re terrified, I made excuses. I had work. I was bloated. I had \u201ca thing.\u201dOne year turned into two.Two turned into three.Then, just by coincidence, I started exhibiting unrelated symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Grumbling, I trudged back to the gynecologist, who I knew would want to do a Pap.After it came back abnormal, I got biopsied. Low-grade cells. No cancer. Eyeroll.When I confessed to my mom and husband I\u2019d been ghosting Dr. G., they were having none of it. To my doc\u2019s credit, he was super cool. After listening to me guilt-cry about staying away, all he said was that he wanted to resend my Pap and biopsies to his own analytics team.A few weeks later, during vacation, I got an email that my Pap was HSIL. In other words, two whole grades worse.To be safe, Dr. G. did another LEEP, under anesthesia this time. For two agonizing weeks, I drummed my fingers waiting for the results. Finally, almost 18 days later, I heard back.I was too eager to realize that my oncologist calling me from his cell on a Monday night probably wasn\u2019t a great sign.He gave me the good news first. My results were CIN 2, so only moderate dysplasia. The margins weren\u2019t clear, but he didn\u2019t sound concerned. I thought this was odd \u2014 until I got the bad news.While Dr. G. was up there LEEPing about, he noticed a patch of dysplasia lurking in the vaginal canal. At the post-op follow-up, two days after the phone call, he broke the news to me. The patch had been biopsied and the results were vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN 3), or cancer stage 0. To preserve sanity, I prefer the former.I asked questions, but he was unusually stoic. Usually we banter, but nothing could get a rise out of him that day. We talked about the procedures I\u2019d be facing, including biopsies and lasers. Before leaving the room all he said was, \u201cWe\u2019ll get you fixed, kid.\u201dSomething about his tone made me want to bawl my eyes out.I didn\u2019t feel much better when I got home and googled. Vaginal precancer is similar to how cervical dysplasia and cancer work, except it\u2019s comparably rare, especially in someone my age. Treatments are less pleasant, somewhat weird, and under-researched. Reading that you\u2019re already past the point of chemo cream isn\u2019t very encouraging.As I type this, I\u2019m recovering from numerous vaginal biopsies. I was in tons of pain once I awoke from anesthesia \u2014 enough that two hits of IV Fentanyl did nothing. Golf ball-sized swellings have arisen in places I didn\u2019t think were possible. Peeing terrifies me.There is blood. Everywhere.In December, whether I have cancer or not, I\u2019ll be getting laser ablation to vaporize my vaginal epithelium. If my VAIN 3 is in more than one spot, or if it\u2019s already mutated into cancer, I may need a partial vaginectomy. Yes, it\u2019s exactly what you think it is.Gulp.The prospect of losing part of my vagina understandably hasn\u2019t sat well. Positive thinking is tough when so much has already gone wrong.Putting self-imposed bans on research has helped. I\u2019m in a medical situation few can relate to, and there\u2019s a ton of speculation. It\u2019s hard not to get sucked into worst possible scenarios.To prevent my fear from paralyzing me again, I\u2019m exercising what control I can. I\u2019m adopting a mostly plant-based diet and will be back to exercising three times a week as soon as I heal. Among other vitamins, I\u2019m taking AHCC \u2014 a Japanese mushroom that\u2019s currently undergoing clinical trials. For some of my precancer forum buddies who\u2019ve participated, AHCC has effectively suppressed their HPV infections, which doctors previously thought was impossible.I\u2019m not holding my breath that anything will work, and I need to be prepared for anything. Because my body hasn\u2019t kicked the virus in so many years, I\u2019ve even started investigating the possibility of a genetic mutation. A woman on my boards had a decade of intractable dysplasia that spread from her cervix to her vagina and vulva and then finally her anus. It took six months of NIH monitoring for them to figure out that she had a rare genetic mutation that diminshed her T cell count.She got a bone marrow transplant and, as far as we know, is still alive.I\u2019ve only hinted at the terrifying lack of knowledge that still exists about HPV, let alone the stigma I\u2019ve faced. I\u2019ve grinned and borne it as they\u2019ve hacked at me, piece by piece, while there\u2019s still no reliable HPV test for men.I\u2019ll refrain from those rants until I can sit properly again. Still, it\u2019s tough to lie here with a chopped up vagina and not do a little preaching.If you\u2019re a parent, you\u2019ve probably seen the commercials guilt-tripping you into vaccinating your kids when they\u2019re 11. Listen to them.If you\u2019re a person who has sex with other people, you\u2019re at risk. Anal and oral cancers from HPV are on the rise. Cervical cancer rates for folks in that late-Gen-X\/Old Millennial sweet spot are still climbing. Black women are dying in particularly alarming numbers, regardless of age.The great news is that the FDA recently broadened its Gardasil recommendation to include adults ages 27\u201345. It\u2019s a whole new generation that will be protected if everyone gets vaccinated.While cancer is rare, and so is what\u2019s happened to me, I\u2019m living proof that it\u2019s a risk you don\u2019t want to take.Everyone I\u2019ve told so far has been a sweetheart. They\u2019ve been sympathetic, horrified, and even given me awesome gifts like the sexiest underwear possible that still holds industrial-strength pads. People have cut me slack I never would have cut myself before.I\u2019ve set a high bar for my friends. Though I expect them to check in every once in a while, what I expect more is crude humor and much joking at my expense. People are slow on the uptake, but I\u2019m giving them time to come around.I recognize my reliance on humor for the coping mechanism it is. Every time HPV is in the news or a comedienne jokes, I work past the twinge in my heart. I still laugh, but I know I\u2019d laugh more if I wasn\u2019t so afraid.If I can\u2019t be funny, I know I\u2019ll dwell on the wounds that will be open long after the bleeding stops. The ones that can destroy marriages. The ones that sicken me with jealousy whenever I see young women in their early thirties with little babies in sparkly shoes. The ones I\u2019ll probably need years of therapy for, and will never be able to laugh at.I\u2019ll talk about that stuff someday. I\u2019m not there yet.What I will confess is that for the first time, I\u2019m scared about cancer. Even 15 years in and waiting for results of biopsies taken from my freaking vagina, I\u2019m still childishly impatient. I still need someone, or something, to fault for this gigantic mess.Most of the time, logic hushes the blame and regret. No one signs up for this, even at 17. I don\u2019t have a Time Turner to tell the asshat from Northeast Philly to go eat a bag of glass and stay away from a vulnerable and mentally ill child.Then again, I was a bright girl. I was, in all the wrong ways, an innocent girl. A good girl.A girl who made a single mistake that might end up killing her.The woman I am is a shell of who I could have been. I\u2019m cautious and haunted, looking way too long before I leap. I surrender to my mind, unable to pull myself out when I need to. Time in my terror bubble moves slowly while the thriving world bustles past, never knowing how resigned I am that a virus might one day kill me.Dr. M. thinks that the real me \u2014 the Woman Who Lives\u2014 is in there, somewhere. In her conviction, she\u2019s tried some funky exercises to help me find her. One day, she told me to close my eyes and envision this scenario:Imagine you\u2019re walking on a path in the woods. Not dark woods, but light woods, with sunshine filtering through. The leaves are bright. You\u2019re calm, your strides are even, and you\u2019re barefoot. The shaded path is strewn with rose petals. You seem to glide on the petals beneath your feet, which feel like cool silk.Then, you enter a clearing. The sky is cloudless, and the grass is verdant. In the center, there is a bonfire, contained within a beautiful marble structure. To its side, there is a pile of pink construction paper and a pen.Take a piece of the pink construction paper. On it, write the thing you\u2019re most ashamed of \u2014 the thing you wish you could take back.And then, when you\u2019re ready, throw it in the fire and burn it. Watch quietly as the smoke wafts up through the beautiful clearing, past the green of the trees and into the blue of the sky.When I opened my eyes, Dr. M. asked how I felt. As I wiped away tears I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d cried, I said that I felt liberated. Whole.She smiled serenely and said, \u201cYou need to cut yourself a fucking break, dear one.\u201dBefore I knew it, my lungs were gasping out sobs. For so long, I\u2019ve felt the pressure to smile and function despite it all. It\u2019s the way of the world, and I\u2019m an adult with responsibilities. Life won\u2019t wait for me to move past this.But maybe Dr. M. is right. If the shame has been holding me back, letting it go is a first step.It\u2019s not quite badass, but it\u2019s a start.Written byWritten by","10060":"By Beau FriedlanderHere\u2019s what happened when I didn\u2019t eat for prescribed periods of time: it affected every cell in my body, and my mind started working better.

Titles like, How to make a full-time income as a freelance writer, and, 5 Reasons You\u2019ll Love Freelancing make this job seem a lot more glamorous than it often is.Don\u2019t get me wrong, there is a lot to love about freelance writing, namely the freedom it represents. You can work from home, have flexible hours, and there\u2019s no boss breathing down the back of your neck.But, there\u2019s also a lot to dislike about freelance writing. Mommy bloggers and self-help gurus looking to sell their e-books will tell you that anybody can be a freelance writer. Which, technically, is true, but not everyone can be a successful freelance writer.Freelance writing is still just a job, and it's not a one size fits all. Not everyone is capable of thriving as a freelance writer, just like not everyone would be happy as a nurse, welder or lawyer. I, for instance, would be a terrible surgeon\u2014 I can\u2019t stand the pressure of holding someone\u2019s life in my hands, and I tend to have a weak stomach.The issue is that anybody looking to start freelance writing is only ever given the positives, so they\u2019re later blindsided by the negatives that accompany this job. Some of them, falsely believing that anybody could be happy as a freelance writer, will be unprepared for the moment they realize they hate it.I\u2019m not trying to discourage anyone, but I also want to discuss the reality of freelance writing, rather than only the best case scenario. There are plenty of reasons why you should become a freelance writer, but there are also plenty of reasons why you shouldn\u2019t.In many ways, becoming a freelance writer is a lot like owning your own business. Not only do you have to create quality content, but you also have to find clients to pay for that content. Unless you happen to be a big-name writer, nobody is going to seek you out.You\u2019re also in charge of communicating with clients and working out any issues that might arise. There will be difficult clients \u2014 who just can\u2019t seem to figure out what they want \u2014 and maybe even clients who try to con you. Unlike other jobs, you won\u2019t be able to hand these people off to HR or ask your boss for guidance. You are the boss.Even when you do manage to snag great assignments, you still have to fill the role of a manager. In a regular workplace, a supervisor helps motivate you to finish your work as well as call you out when you\u2019re doing something wrong. However, when you\u2019re a freelance writer, you\u2019re solely responsible for any work you produce. Nobody is managing you or keeping you on track but yourself.For some people, the freedom to work for yourself is the reason why they get into freelance work. But it\u2019s important to realize that not everyone likes being their own boss. Some people are more efficient when they only have to worry about completing their assignments rather than the stress brought on by managing money and clients.It is crucial for you to realize what category you fall into. You might not know yet, and maybe dipping your toe into the world of freelance will help you find out. But, if you\u2019re the kind of person who withers under the pressure of self-management, you shouldn\u2019t force yourself into freelance writing. That\u2019s not the only way you can succeed as a writer.Everyone wants to work from home. I log onto Instagram, and I\u2019m spammed with enticing ads that tell me how I can make \u201c$5,000 a month from the comfort of my bedroom\u201d.I get it. Nobody likes having to wake up at eight in the morning and put on something professional before they head into the office. It\u2019s a lot more tempting to do your work in your own space, or while sipping coffee at Starbucks.That being said, many people underestimate the amount of social stimulation a workplace environment can provide. Even if you do have to get up early and deal with traffic, you still get to spend your day around people. You can goof off with co-workers, and speak face-to-face with your boss.Working from home might not be a big deal for someone who\u2019s extremely social and often interacting with friends, but for introverts who spend a lot of time alone anyway, it can feel isolating.Some people can conquer this loneliness by being more social in their private life \u2014 such as going out with friends more, joining a class, or meeting people online \u2014 but other people still need to spend their day in a real workplace to feel socially connected.Working for a company comes with security. In addition to benefits like insurance and vacation days, you also get the promise of a steady paycheck.The same cannot be said for freelance writing. You\u2019ll go through dry spells, where your assignments are scarce and you\u2019re barely scraping by, but you\u2019ll also experience times when you feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you need to do.Some freelancers deal with uncertainty by saving their money. When they have an inflow of income, they\u2019ll stash part of it away for those times when they\u2019re short on cash. Still, the anxiety of not knowing how much you might make next month can be crippling. For all of its freedom, freelancing cannot promise security. This is the same reason why so many people hesitate to do this job full-time. It\u2019s often better to work for a steady paycheck and do freelance writing part-time.Freelance writing isn\u2019t all endless freedom and wads of cash \u2014 it\u2019s also a time-consuming business, sometimes lonely, and full of uncertainty.This might all sound bleak, but I\u2019m not trying to discourage you from chasing your dream. The good news is that if you truly do want to become a freelance writer, the problems I listed above all have solutions. You can improve your self-management style, be more social and save your money. It won\u2019t be easy, but anything worth having never is.Written byWritten by","10158":"I sit on a runway. It\u2019s getting dark and it\u2019s raining. The flight attendant says it\u2019s time to switch our portable electronic devices to airplane mode. Most people ignore them. I\u2019m quickly flipping through my \u201ccritical\u201d apps one last time, getting in that final check before jetting off into a communication black hole. There is nothing new waiting in those apps and I know that; I checked less than a minute ago. But I check again anyway. We take off. I flip my phone to airplane mode. Soon we\u2019ll be at our cruising altitude and it won\u2019t matter what mode my phone is in; checking in will be off the table. I\u2019m relieved.The airplane is like a communication time warp. A throwback to an age where uninterrupted conversations could flow for extended periods of time. A time when we were comfortable just staring out the window watching the world go by. A time when one might find themselves bored with only their wandering thoughts to entertain them.A healthy amount of idle time is not only good for us but makes us more creative and may be critical to our happiness.If you live in a city and don\u2019t actively travel into rural towns or wilderness, the airplane might be the only time you experience this kind of forced disconnection. It feels freeing. It feels like a weight is lifted. That little piece of your brain constantly preoccupied with what you might be missing finally gets a break. A brief rest before it is re-engaged the moment the wheels touch down at your destination.We need that rest and disconnection. We need our thoughts to wander, unguided and unprompted. We need uninterrupted conversation. And, most importantly, we need extended moments of boredom and the creativity and introspection that comes from it. Unfortunately, those moments are getting harder and harder to come by.The last time I flew, there was Wi-Fi available on the plane. The modem happened to be down so we couldn\u2019t connect, but it was there. Every plane will soon have Wi-Fi. Being 30,000 feet above the planet will no longer be an escape. We\u2019ll all feel pressure to post our airplane window pics in real-time.The spread of the internet is inevitable. Google and Facebook are already on a mission to bring reliable service to rural and developing areas, and that effort will only intensify. Soon access to the web will reach every corner of the globe.This expansion, in and of itself, is not necessarily a problem. The problem is, once the entire world is connected, where will we go to get away? We need connection, but we also need solitude and silence. Our happiness and success depend on it.Boredom can be scary. With nothing around to distract our brains, we are alone with our thoughts. For many of us, this is uncomfortable\u2014and for good reason. The feeling of boredom can actually cause us physiological stress.As Mark Hawkins writes in his book The Power of Boredom, studies found that levels of the stress hormone cortisol were much higher among participants who felt bored compared to other emotions. And \u201cpsychologist Robert Plutchik has linked boredom to a form of disgust, similar to what we might feel when we smell rotten food.\u201d Much of our physiological response to boredom drives us to want to avoid it, and we actively look for distraction to do that.Over the centuries, we\u2019ve devised a stunning array of options to fill our idle time: communal storytelling, performances and plays, sports, music, art, literature, games, films, etc. The flight from boredom has created the basis of much of our cultural history. So, boredom is repulsive, like smelly rotten food, and the pursuit of entertainment produces wonderful cultural treasures. This feels like a clear justification to eradicate boredom. But, like most things in life, it\u2019s never that simple.Boredom opens up space for pause and introspection.Despite our aversion to boredom, it turns out that a healthy amount of idle time is not only good for us, but makes us more creative and may be critical to our happiness and emotional growth.Recent studies have shown that boredom can drive increased creativity as your mind moves into a \u201cseeking state.\u201d This free-flowing state allows the brain to traverse through seemingly unconnected thoughts, which can generate unforeseen connections and insights. This heightened ability includes our capacity for creative problem-solving. People who were pushed into a state of boredom prior to solving a given problem were not only able to find more creative solutions, but also a wider range of possible solutions. Given the magnitude and complexity of the problems society currently faces, the ability to devise creative solutions will only become more and more critical.But that\u2019s just the tip of the boredom iceberg. While increased creativity is a powerful side effect of idle time, it is not the most important. More important is the fact that boredom opens up space for pause and introspection. As Intel fellow Genevieve Bell put it, \u201cBeing bored is actually a moment when your brain gets to reset itself\u2026 Your consciousness gets to reset itself too.\u201dHawkins echoes this sentiment:Boredom is a special space in time that provides us with a bird\u2019s eye view of life. The examination that boredom allows helps us steer our lives toward the best road possible.Personal and, ultimately, societal growth come from individual introspection. Moments of introspection allow us to grapple with inner thoughts and process daily inputs. It creates space to think critically about what we\u2019ve seen, heard and experienced, and to form our own opinions about them and find those unexpected connections that help us see things through a different light. This process feeds our lifelong emotional development, helping us \u201csteer our lives toward the best road possible.\u201dWithout introspection, there is no space to question, consider, and form our own opinions. Without introspection, there is only space for reactionary responses and rote regurgitation of spoon-fed information. An increasingly divisive and deceptive world thrives when introspection and critical thinking are limited.You can\u2019t understand who you are and what you believe, let alone be able to understand someone else\u2019s beliefs, if you don\u2019t take time to think. We need to engage with our inner thoughts, but we can\u2019t truly hear them unless we step into boredom. Embracing a healthy amount of idle time opens up deep opportunities to think, breathe and create connections.We\u2019ve always sought to escape boredom, but until recently, it was impossible to completely avoid it. For the majority of human history, much of our \u201cin between\u201d time was spent idle. Just thinking or talking or looking around. Today, internet-connected devices make it possible to fill every second of our time, and those activities\u2014thinking, talking, looking\u2014become more and more fleeting.Sherry Turkle of MIT described this phenomenon in her book Reclaiming Conversation:We say we turn to our phones when we\u2019re \u201cbored.\u201d And often we find ourselves bored because we have become accustomed to a constant feed of connection, information, and entertainment.[\u2026]It all adds up to a flight from conversation\u2014at least from conversation that is open-ended and spontaneous, conversations in which we play with ideas, in which we allow ourselves to be fully present and vulnerable.When distraction is always a click away, it is our conversations, both inward and outward, that suffer most.The internet is a large part of my life. I make a living designing digital products and teaching future product designers. I dedicate a lot of mental space to contemplating the impact of technology\u2014both the good and the bad. There is so much positive about our web-enabled world, but the addictive nature of our devices has made it incredibly difficult for even the most resolute among us to truly pry ourselves away.It\u2019s easy to forget how quickly this has happened. I spent half my life internet-free and all but a quarter of it without a smartphone. Less than a decade ago, idle time was nearly impossible to avoid. Today, to have idle time\u2014to reflect, to think, to breathe, to turn it off\u2014requires a conscious choice. You either power down your devices or find a place the internet can\u2019t reach. Fortunately, it is still possible to find those places, but they are fast disappearing.The protection of our wild spaces represents one of the greatest public goods the U.S. has ever created.Growing up, I spent a lot of time in the woods. As part of a family that prized the outdoors, we did everything from cabin camping to extended backpacking trips. At the time, I didn\u2019t appreciate or understand what the wilderness represented. Maybe it was because everyday life was yet to be hyperconnected, so the woods didn\u2019t feel all that different. But now that hyperconnection is the norm, the juxtaposition is stark.The wilderness is a place of both deep solitude and deep connection. You are either alone with your thoughts or talking to the people you\u2019re with. Those represent the full breadth of your options.We desperately need those places. In an always-on world, with devices designed to pull so hard it\u2019s difficult to break free, we need that forcing function. We need those moments where we mindlessly pull out our phone only to find no signal.At the moment, despite our rapid advances, much of the wilderness is still that sanctuary. A place the internet can\u2019t reach. Like a plane at 30,000 feet. The question is, how long will it stay that way?In 1964, the United States Congress passed the Wilderness Act. The act created a legal definition of wilderness and now protects 110 million acres of land from human development. It defines wilderness as follows:A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.The protection of our wild spaces represents one of the greatest public goods the U.S. has ever created. A rare moment where we were able to understand there are things that supersede economic development and capitalist pursuits.This wilderness preservation system provides areas across the country where people are given the opportunity to escape the modern world and step into a place of comparative solitude and silence\u2014a last refuge for boredom and introspection.In the 1960s, when the Wilderness Act was signed, the digital revolution was but a glimmer in the eye of just a handful of people, and only a few of them could have predicted where it would ultimately go. Today, the idea of a space \u201cuntrammeled by man\u201d can no longer be defined as simply lacking physical development or resource exploitation, it must also include the absence of our expanding array of digital technologies.A wilderness, in contrast to those areas dominated by man, should have no signal.In 2017, there were 331 million visits to U.S. national parks, which is tied with 2016 for the most annual visits in history. People crave these spaces and the disconnection they provide. We\u2019ve overplayed our hand in the war on boredom and the pendulum is starting to swing. There are technology-free summer camps for adults, devices to lock away your phones during events, and bars with built-in Faraday cages to block cell signals.Introspection and conversation are not dependent on pristine landscapes alone, they are dependent on disconnection. We need to continue to protect our wild spaces from those elements of human creation that we can see, but also protect them from the elements we can\u2019t see. A wilderness, in contrast to those areas dominated by man, should have no signal.There are a number of ways this can be accomplished. It could be easements that require transmission towers to be certain distances away from designated areas. It could be no-fly zones for aerial transmitters or a requirement that those transmitters be programmed to cease transmission as they pass over specific areas. Or we could pursue large-scale signal jamming in designated zones.We have legislative, historical, and cultural precedent for protecting and valuing lands and spaces that allow us to step away from the rush of modernity and stay the hand of human progress. We need these escapes and the introspective disconnection they provide. It\u2019s time for us to consider expanding that precedent for the digital age by making the wilderness a place the internet can\u2019t reach.Written byWritten by","10170":"Sometimes life\u2019s most well-fed intentions are the hardest to digest.This is a story about a girl (me), a caf\u00e9 (Nourish Kitchen + Table), and a handful of realities and insights learned from opening and closing a business in a city both inspiring and exhausting (New York).Within a span of five years, I opened a successful and notable restaurant in Manhattan with the intention of nourishing its clientele inside and out, and I closed that restaurant under what you might call nightmarish circumstances\u2014unexpected, swift, and a good bit traumatic. I had climbed a mountain of kale salad, rose chai lattes, harissa-spiced roast chicken, and calculated risk, and then that mountain crumbled right under my weary but steadfast feet. I had failed to nourish myself.Opening a restaurant is both exhilarating and, in many ways, self-destructive. You do not open a restaurant in New York, or anywhere for that matter, to get rich, because \u201cit sounds fun,\u201d or because you want a four-hour workweek. Most often, you open a restaurant because you carry a slight strain of crazed enthusiasm and because, like it or not, it\u2019s your calling\u2014visceral and boiling on high heat.I felt a massive magnetic pull not only to talk about food, but to bring the conversation into being \u2014 to birth that baby in a brick-and-mortar space and to storytell.With curious excitement, dozens of people have asked me over the years why and how I opened my restaurant. Apparently, restaurants put you in an entirely different class of business ownership and entrepreneurship; intrigue and romantic allure seem to be attached to the notion of working with food. And that, in part, is likely why many of us are in it.Food has always been a part of my professional life. I am a registered dietitian and had a well-known nutrition and culinary consulting practice, also called Nourish, for over 10 years before opening Nourish the caf\u00e9. I am a self-taught chef. I did not rise through the storied ranks of line cooks learning my way in blazing hot kitchens. But, after five years of doing everything imaginable and unimaginable in the back of house, front of house, our windowless basement bunker of an office, and at off-site catering events (read: being emotionally harassed and verbally threatened, stolen from, and wading through two inches of dank sewage spewing from a clogged basement drain at 1 a.m. on more than one occasion), I think I\u2019ve earned my keep in the kitchen.You don\u2019t always have a choice in the paths life takes you on. Opening Nourish was something I couldn\u2019t not do.The restaurant industry is well-known as a rough and tumble world. Gratefully, I inherited my grandmother\u2019s Bronx-bred tenacity and was determined to open an all-day caf\u00e9 reimagining fresh food that was both delicious and made you feel really, really good (aka \u201chealthful\u201d).For over a decade prior to opening the caf\u00e9, I spent countless hours talking about food (and, dare I say, wellness) with nutrition clients and the media, and I developed a strong ethos about cooking what the seasons and our locality provide us. I inherently employ intuition and feeling in the kitchen (let the vegetables and herbs and spices speak to you!), and I tend to look back to create forward\u2014meaning, I pull reference and inspiration from family roots, the culinary heritage of cultures, and from the intoxicating thrill of discovering exhilarating ingredients. I felt a massive magnetic pull not only to talk about food, but to bring the conversation into being\u2014to birth that baby in a brick-and-mortar space and to storytell.And so I manifested, without really realizing I was manifesting.Food and restaurants can be beautiful, wondrous ways of connecting a sense of time, place, and self. I wanted to convey these things through intentional, balanced food and an experience that makes you feel something, and remember it. A close friend and colleague recently termed me as a sort of \u201cfood intuitive\u201d\u2014maybe she\u2019s not too far off.And so I manifested, without really realizing I was manifesting. I became the queen of mood boards, and I\u2019m not talking about Pinterest. Anyone who entered my apartment from the years 2008 to 2013 got a nice dose of poster boards adorned with magazine tear-outs, printed images, and color swatches. I complemented those boards with years worth of note-taking and mental-cataloging on my travels (Paris, London, Copenhagen, Turkey, and around the U.S. and throughout NYC). I ran my running shoes flat dead doing a similar route every morning through the West Village for about 18 months in order to watch retail space openings and closings, scoping out potential locations and foot-traffic patterns. [Insert that strain of entrepreneurial intensity again.]Nourish opened in the scorching summer of 2013, a tiny sliver of a caf\u00e9 in the West Village. I\u2019d spent the previous eight months checking off a never-ending punch list: secure lease; remove old Department of Building fines from prior tenant; align architect, contractor, subcontractors, and expeditor; obtain construction permits; wait for Con Edison to figure out the gas situation; obtain all necessary licenses (a zillion of them); cobble together a strong opening team; woo community board members and prove that I was not the Wicked Witch of the West Village out to bring raucous booze-filled 2 a.m. nights to the neighborhood.Prior to all that, I spent a couple years as a determined force of one seeing nutrition clients by day, hawking a lengthy and detailed business plan by night and weekends. I managed to scrape up investment through friends and family, and with serious fortitude, I solidified a small business loan, which in hindsight, is not necessarily something I would recommend for someone launching a business out of the gates. Startup businesses, such as restaurants, need time and a proper financial runway to fully get off the ground, and small business loans don\u2019t always provide both those things concurrently.Opening a restaurant, let alone one with three services a day, isn\u2019t for everyone.I opened Nourish\u2019s doors like many small businesses and restaurants do: with energy, excitement, stress, a lot of cold-brew coffee, and little in the bank. Everything in the space was a piece of me, from the brass shelving unit, singular dark navy wall, and retail shelves of cool tableware, to the aesthetic and flavors of the food and the foundation of the recipes. I\u2019d even commissioned the hand-drawn, provocative no-smoking sign (copies of which have since been spotted around town). It all started with me, and down the road some really fantastic staff helped carry the torch.Thankfully, the concept caught on. Nourish manifested itself from my brain into a little jewel box-like space. A long, marbled service counter showcased breakfast, lunch, dinner, housemade pastries, fresh-pressed juices and seasonal shrubs, great coffee and some of NYC\u2019s best matcha (in my humble opinion), and a tiny, but thoughtful, selection of natural wines and craft beers. Ceramic serving dishes and butcher block boards overflowed with breakfast tartines, turmeric tea eggs with a jammy six-minute yolk, and bubbling apple-pecan baked oatmeal; vibrant salads and vegetable dishes that would turn the heads of vegetable naysayers; wholesome grains studded with ingredients that would make you raise an eyebrow and then order a serving or two; lean proteins like harissa roast chicken glistening in a cloak of olive oil and garnet-colored spice; baked goods like steamy morning scones, my grandmother\u2019s re-envisioned cult-classic apple kuchen cake, and coconut-dark chocolate macaroons, and more.You could take food to-go or sit and stay awhile. We were not vegan or vegetarian or paleo or keto or overly trend-driven. We just did what we did\u2014served really fresh, tasty, meticulously sourced food. The fact that the food was also inherently good for you was a bonus.Nourish took flight in its first few weeks, months, and beyond thanks to a number of factors: a growing devoted following, a welcoming staff, eagle-eye customer service, neighborhood celebrity enthusiasts, the goodwill of the press (we didn\u2019t have funds for external PR), a burgeoning catering business, and a community of customers who treated Nourish as their own dining room and kitchen. The food did its job. It nourished them and made them feel a little better than before they\u2019d come in. It also informed them at times\u2014like when we decided to take avocado toast off the menu to strengthen our focus on locality and bring light to the avocado industry\u2019s political and environmental concerns. All of this was precisely what I\u2019d hoped for.Nourish also took flight despite a couple of setbacks. After just six weeks, the individual tasked with heading up the kitchen quit and then attempted blackmailing me into firing them. Opening a restaurant, let alone one with three services a day, isn\u2019t for everyone. We also became quickly acquainted with the caf\u00e9\u2019s resident ghost, friendly but mischievous, who we lovingly named Lupita. And, of course, there was the issue of little furry \u201cfriends\u201d visiting our very clean kitchen from the unkempt bowels of the apartment building we directly attached to (more on that later).You never know how deep and hellish challenges can become until you\u2019re in the midst of them.It\u2019s no big surprise to say that businesses go through ups and downs of all kinds\u2014that\u2019s their nature. So what did I do? It\u2019s like I had just given birth to a child (or 20), and I did what any mother would do. I dug deeper than I knew possible and I pushed ahead; it was survival of the fittest. Being \u201cunfit\u201d was not an option. Thankfully there was a gym right next door to the caf\u00e9.Over the years, customers became good friends, a few even became staff members, and some became like family. We saw engagements, marriages, births, new jobs, and new cities. Customers who moved away would often come back to visit when in town. I\u2019m pretty sure our communal dining table even ignited a few unions and new friendships, certainly lots of conversation. And there were definitely tears and emotional goodbyes when Nourish abruptly closed this past January.I enjoy a good challenge; some might say I thrive on challenges. NYC may well be the king of setting forth challenge after challenge, particularly for any food establishment. I knew this from the beginning, but you never know how deep and hellish challenges can become until you\u2019re in the midst of them. The city has sadly become an impossible environment for restaurateurs, no matter how talented or well-backed. Neighborhoods across the city and Brooklyn that were once buzzing with energy have been turned upside-down or gone quiet thanks to priced out real estate, new construction, and landlord tax breaks on storefronts that sit empty. This equates to blow after blow for restaurants: high rents, skyrocketing real estate taxes (which are often passed down to tenants), lulls in foot traffic, and a distinct decline (read: mass exodus) of creative talent because the city is simply too expensive and too exhausting. The intoxicating city that so many fell in love with has been shifting for a while and if something doesn\u2019t change soon, we\u2019ll all end up in LA or elsewhere.In Nourish\u2019s case, my core staff and I fought through this in every way possible. And we grew consistently every year. Our in-house business, catering business, and a brand-new sister line of baby food, Nourish Baby, all launched and operated within 535 square feet of ground floor space and about the same in the basement\u2014with no walk-in refrigerator, thank you. We had to make it work because there was little alternative. In our last full year of operation, gross revenues reached just over $2 million and we had consistent business.There are insufficient resources and financial funding for female business owners, particularly in the food and restaurant industry.We also had unimaginable real estate taxes that jumped year after year, and we had a growing mouse problem stemming from the unkempt basement of the apartment building we attached to. When you own a restaurant, you quickly become friends with your exterminator. I liken mine to Superman. He sealed up holes and created blockades for years (these sort of problems always fall to the tenant). But there\u2019s only so much you can do to protect one singular space from filthy forces on the outside. When ongoing street construction flared up and another restaurant within the same apartment building closed down, that gang of mice got to stirring\u2014and they were pissed.The majority of restaurants, retail stores, and apartments in the city deal with pest control problems at some point. We ran a super clean operation, always. And then a gang of mice descended on us. We fought a valiant fight for years, but sadly, the Health Department forced us to close\u2014essentially overnight\u2014for code violations mainly related to the infestation we simply couldn\u2019t get under control despite our best efforts.A New York story with a bittersweet ending.In its lifetime, Nourish accomplished a lot of pretty impactful things. We created a brand that continues to be relevant and recognized even after the storefront closed; people I see around the city remind me of that constantly (and I am grateful). Had we proper funding from the get-go and proper investment down the line for growth, the brand may have had a different trajectory; although I don\u2019t think that would have changed the resulting impact of the mouse invasion. But it does bring to light the notion of female ownership.To put it bluntly, there are insufficient resources and financial funding for female business owners, particularly in the food and restaurant industry. I explored quite a few options and had dozens of conversations with mostly men, and a few women, about growth and investment. It was never my intention to massively scale Nourish and replicate the concept, and that typically was looked down upon in these conversations.Nourish thrived for as long as it did because it exuded soul and an unexplainable energy and magic that can\u2019t, and often shouldn\u2019t, be replicated.Replication means capitalizing on brand recognition, but I believe businesses and brands can also scale through various different but synergistic concepts that all share the same belief system and authenticity. Proper scale leads to proper profit margins\u2014but that\u2019s not sustainable without soul. Nourish thrived for as long as it did because it exuded soul and an unexplainable energy and magic that can\u2019t, and often shouldn\u2019t, be replicated. My goal was, and is, to infuse that same component of soulfulness into fresh ideas and designs.There are insufficient financial support and investment resources for women in business, and particularly for women in hospitality and restaurants. Until this shifts, the inequities like those that the #MeToo movement has brought to light will continue. Without proper financial backing, women cannot become the leaders, restaurant owners, and executive chefs they are capable of being. Sexual harassment, lower pay, overlooked promotions, and dismissed financial opportunities thwart leadership and keep inequity in the restaurant industry thriving. These facts need to continue being included in the equity conversation, and we need to keep having those conversations to create positive change.Thriving always seemed harder than I thought it should have been. People adored Nourish for everything it was, and I was proud and determined and attempted to stabilize and grow the business as best I could. I sacrificed weekends, holidays, my health, and my meager savings, which I said I\u2019d never do. Parents will do anything for their children, and I did the same with my business and my staff. At some point, hard became just too heavy. I was burned out with adrenal depletion, back pain, muscle tension, and serious bouts of depression and self-doubt. I was angry and frustrated and couldn\u2019t figure out why. It finally dawned on me that I was no longer happy. It was that simple.Much of the joy that came with opening Nourish and feeding people faded bit by bit because I was deeply exhausted and constantly stressed. No inspiration trip to Paris or bottle of wine could remedy that. I enjoy many aspects of owning a business and leading a team, but many of my circumstances didn\u2019t allow me to fully employ my creative skill sets around the food itself. When a creative person isn\u2019t capable of expressing their ideas, it can be like a slow and tortured death mentally, physically, and emotionally.Closing down Nourish the way I had to\u2014suddenly and not completely by choice\u2014was in some ways like ripping off a Band-Aid lickety-split. But in other ways, it\u2019s a painful drawn-out process I am still working through. It was devastating to the staff, to the neighborhood, and obviously, to me. It was humbling to watch more than one regular customer shed tears that last day. One small group of regulars held a breakfast mourning session at our communal farm table over matcha lattes and oatmeal. I think it lasted at least two hours.There was a lot of outreach in the weeks and months after the lights went dim. I don\u2019t recall crying. I went into a sort of automaton mode, vacant and robotic. I forged on dismantling the unsavory business and legal stuff and figuring out how to carry on the brand in any feasible way. All I wanted to do was stop and pause and breathe and restore (if only I could hibernate like a bear). That was not an option: I had too much financial debt to work my way out of (and will be working out of for some time). I had to gather the rubble and figure out how to rise up again in the midst of a dark vortex of instability and uncertainty.My experience solidified that bringing good food to others is my calling, and it brought to light what does and does not bring me joy.In the months since closing, I have continued Nourish\u2019s catering services and have let Nourish Baby simmer. All the while, I have slowly started to regain energy and to feel again. And to connect with my body again. I started nourishing myself again.When you go through trauma, the smallest internal cues can start speaking to you. I knew on a deep physical level the foods I needed to be eating: initially a whole lot of coconut milk and warm vegetables, saut\u00e9ed greens and my go-to childhood comfort food white rice with tamari. I craved meditation like never before and I signed up for an intro course in transcendental meditation\u2014and I\u2019m still practicing (most days) now. I have allowed myself to sleep the hours I needed, longer than usual. I started having the desire and energy to exercise again, building up from restorative lower intensity yoga and pilates classes to head-clearing higher intensity dance classes and running. I became more aware of situations and relationships that were serving me and those that weren\u2019t. I have cleaved a lot in order to move baby step by baby step forward.I also have asked for help. I\u2019ll repeat that: I asked for help. It\u2019s a concept foreign to many of us, women and business owners in particular. In the immediate aftermath, a small circle of people surrounded me to help buoy me up. They were nearly all women, most of them business owners or entrepreneurs themselves. They provided me an outlet to voice concerns and fears and simply be me. There was a lot of sticky shit I had to deal with, and am still dealing with, and there is no way I could have done it without them. That tight circle magically brought in others who have been invaluable in helping me work through a rough period, but also look ahead and look into myself, very honestly, for the first time in a long time. We all need a pit crew at times and that crew can only surround you if you speak up.My self-transformation phase is an intriguing process to watch from the inside out. I had to let go, allow myself to make my way down that mountain of kale, crumble to an ash heap, accept that ash heap, and then start the rebuilding process\u2014the phoenix. Much to my mother\u2019s dismay, there is now a sizable, beautifully vibrant tattoo of a phoenix wing adorning my upper left arm, a stamp of my survival and rebirth.Emotionally and professionally when things go awry in life it\u2019s often because something else is about to take hold. Being aware and hopeful keeps us going and gets us closer to being in \u201cthe flow.\u201d It\u2019s the combination of being good to yourself, being present, realizing what brings you joy, and calling it all in. I\u2019m working on it, and it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s something we all probably never stop working on.I don\u2019t have regrets, but I have a crapload of reflections.My goal was and is to positively impact an individual and a broader community in some small capacity through intentional food, to aid the connectivity between soil-season-farm-food-plate-energy-health. But the process and logistics involved in achieving that in New York City\u2019s current climate are nearly impossible. Making sustainable practices and resources more viable for restaurants is necessary if the city is going to have a continued vibrant food scene.I don\u2019t have regrets, but I have a crapload of reflections. And I\u2019m pretty damn positive they will provide me the means of opening another brick-and-mortar concept, under very different circumstances, at some point in the future. That\u2019s the unrelenting dreamer and doer in me. My experience with Nourish solidified that bringing good food to others is my calling and it brought to light what does and does not bring me joy. I created a space that nourished its people, but in doing so, I malnourished myself. There are a lot of lessons in that and being cognizant and kind to myself is at the top of the list. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m not entirely sure what lies ahead, but that\u2019s okay because I\u2019m open to whatever it may be.As Nourish\u2019s beloved morning barista used to say, \u201crise and grind.\u201d And I will.To finish in true Nourish form, here are the stories behind a handful of customer favorites.There was always a kale salad on the menu, for fear of customer revolt otherwise. Nourish\u2019s most noteworthy kale dish quickly grew to be the \u201cDetox Kale Salad\u201d (the name quite possibly contributed to its status): ribbons of purpley, forest green lacinato kale studded with fuchsia pink half-moons of watermelon radish; thin waves of plum or apple; toasted almonds, always sliced not slivered; sesame seeds; and tamari-lime-ginger dressing. I originally created this salad\u2014long before Nourish opened\u2014on a sweaty summer evening, dining on my tiny NYC balcony with a dear friend. It was a very good salad.I\u2019m not sure where it stems from, but I have a thing for rose. The scent and flavor notes could often be found throughout Nourish\u2019s menu: rose-lemon tea loaf; summer peaches with rosewater, toasted coconut, and mint; Persian wedding cookies with rose and pistachio; and the beloved rose chai latte. The rose chai was born early on and became a staple order. We steeped a housemade rose syrup with chai tea and our housemade almond milk (which had a viral following of its own).Garnish it with a couple of dried rose petals and it is instant warmth, gratification, and Instagram love. A rose chai was the last item ordered on the day we closed down\u2014by one of our most discerning customers. He was five years old at the time and wore the biggest almond-milk-soaked smile.There really isn\u2019t a story behind this dish, to be honest. But I can confidently tell you that people love some oatmeal. My parents would make me oatmeal on wintry mornings before elementary school\u2014swirling with a dab of butter, dash of salt, splash of milk, and without fail, sliced bananas or raisins because there always has to be some fruit in there. In a word, it was the perfect balance between salt and sweet and satisfying.When creating an oatmeal for Nourish, I had a sense that the butter wouldn\u2019t fly with the morning Equinox gym crowd, but I kept that same satisfying balance in mind. Gluten-free oats (and for the record, all oats are gluten-free), almond milk, diced apple, golden raisins, a touch of maple syrup, and a pecan streusel for an extra hit of satisfying healthy fat to carry you through the morning. Sometimes we\u2019d get racy and swap in summer blueberries and lemon zest. Who knew something as simple as a warming bowl of oatmeal would be such a runaway hit; a little nostalgia always helps.The cult-favorite sweet potato noodles are Korean noodles made from yam starch. They are naturally gluten-free and people went bananas over them. In part because they were gluten-free and in part because they\u2019re a great chewy but firm texture and plain ol\u2019 yummy. We came up with a number of different flavor iterations over the years, but everyone always requested the OG version: a warmed sauce of ginger, garlic, tamari, sesame oil, and a few other ingredients (trade secrets) tossed with whatever seasonal dark leafy greens we could get our hands on (amaranth greens being a personal favorite), sometimes roasted turnips or radishes, sometimes bok choy, toasted black sesame seeds, and crispy lotus root chips. They\u2019re not calorie-free, but if you\u2019re on the hunt for a decent gluten-free noodle, they get a gold star.Many of Nourish\u2019s dishes had a distinctly Middle Eastern flare. I\u2019ve always been drawn to that region\u2019s deep-rooted food culture and, of course, its incredible use of seductive spices. Long before Nourish opened, I had an ex-boyfriend who hated garlic but enjoyed a good bit of heat in his food. I was horrified about the garlic aversion, but it urged me to create a roast chicken that was delicious regardless.And so a house-blended harissa dry rub was born. Sweet and hot paprika, cumin, coriander, onion powder, salt, and pepper (and post-boyfriend, garlic powder, of course). In truth, I probably snuck bits of roasted garlic on that first \u201cboyfriend chicken\u201d somehow, and then finished it with lemon and thyme. At Nourish, the chicken was always brined first and served up crispy and garnet-glistening with an extra squeeze of olive oil and some dried rose petals\u2014because you shouldn\u2019t wait on a partner to give you roses.Written byWritten by","10194":"Anyone with a chronic condition, mental or physical, will hear this.

This is incorrect. While we may not know how cancer develops, we already know quite a bit about things that cause cancer. In fact, the first cause of cancer caused by an external agent was described in1761 by Dr. John Hill of London, a physician, botanist and medical writer. Tobacco was first used by the native Americans, and mention of its use came from explorers of the New World. By 1614, it was widely in use in Europe with an estimated 7000 shops in London. Smoking tobacco was replaced in polite society by snuffing, a type of smokeless tobacco. A pinch of ground up tobacco is inhaled or \u2018snuffed\u2019 usually after putting it on the back of the hand between the thumb and first finger. This area is sometimes called the \u2018anatomic snuff box\u2019 for that reason. In 1761, Dr. Hill described two case histories of \u2018polypusses\u2019 of the nose, which he believed were cancer. This was the first known description of a chemical (tobacco snuffing) causing cancer. There is some controversy as to whether there is truly a link, but given the rarity of its use, having gone out of style along with the monocle and topcoat, is no longer of much significance. Also given how snuffing tobacco gives you a highly unattractive \u2018Adolf Hitler\u2019 look, it is no surprise about its fall from popularity.The most definitive proof of cancer causing chemicals was provided by Sir Percivall Pott (1714\u20131788). Considered one of the greatest surgeons of his era, along with John Hunter, Percivall Pott was born in London in 1714 and worked diligently towards becoming a clergyman. Eventually changing his mind, he apprenticed at St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital and gained his full licence in 1736 being granted the Grand Diploma by the Court of Examiners of the Barbers Surgeon Company. In 1756, Pott was thrown from his horse, sustaining a compound fracture. During his forced convalescence, he began writing about various topics in medicine that still bear his name. An astute observer of disease, he is remembered for \u2018Pott\u2019s fracture\u2019 and also named for tuberculous disease known as Pott\u2019s disease.However, his link to cancer came with his 1775 description of cancer of the scrotum which was a particular bane of the chimney sweeps in London. After the Great Fire of London of 1666, new fire codes were enacted which required smaller, more tortuous chimney configurations. This reduced the chance of another major fire, but made it more difficult to clean chimneys using mechanical methods like a long brush. In addition, the increased turns made it easier to accumulate soot and creosote that needed cleaning. So chimneys were dirtier, and more difficult to clean. Solution? Send little children into those chimneys to clean them!Meanwhile, in 1773, an Englishman named Jonah Hanway returned from China, disturbed to learn how Chinese parents were callously murdering their baby daughters. Investigating the situation at home, he was disturbed to learn that only 7 out of 100 children survived over a year in the orphanages. They were often assigned to workhouses, where working conditions were dismal. Laws were passed to limit the workhouses to less than 3 weeks, with the effect that thousands of children were essentially sent out into the streets, where sometimes the only work was climbing up a steaming chimney, risking your life to brush out some soot.Chimney sweep apprentices started as young as age 3 1\/2 years, but most were older than 6, only because they were otherwise considered too weak, unable to work long hours, or too easily would \u2018go off\u2019 (they would die). The apprentice agreement required a weekly bath, but most followed the common London chimney sweep tradition of 3 baths per year. Why take a bath today, if you\u2019re going to climb into a dusty, dirty, dangerous chimney tomorrow?There were a million horrible painful ways for children chimney sweeps to die. They would often get stuck inside chimneys, fall from great heights, suffocated when soot fell on them, or burned to death. If they survived to puberty, one more horror awaited them \u2014 chimney sweeper\u2019s cancer. Children as young as 8 years old were coming in with cancer of the scrotum. It started with what they called a soot-wart. If caught early enough, chimney sweeps would cut the soot-wart off with a razor. But if not, it would soon invade the skin, through the scrotum, into the testicles and then into the abdomen. It was painfully destructive and often fatal. It was rare outside of England. An Act of Parliament passed in 1840 to improve the plight of the chimney sweep, but lax enforcement led to continued abuse and no decrease in cases of scrotal cancer.It was quite clear that this was a uniquely occupational hazard as scrotal cancer was exceedingly rare in any other circumstance, and also quite rare outside of England, where better protective clothing was available. Dr Pott determined that it was the soot that was the causative agent of cancer. The soot was lodging in the folds of the scrotal skin and over time, put the sweeps at risk of cancer. Once the use of small boys as chimney sweeps declined, the disease faded away once again into obscurity.Tar, which formed up to 1\/3 of the chemical of soot, was the chief suspect. In 1915, Japanese scientists were able to induce cancer by applying coal tar to skins of experimental animals every 2\u20133 days for 3 months. Throughout the 1920s researchers worked on isolating the compounds with the soot that was carcinogenic since soot contains many different potential cancer causing chemicals. Benzpyrene was eventually isolated as one of the most carcinogenic. While soot would be one of the first chemicals described to cause cancer (carcinogen), it would only be the first of many.Written byWritten by","10401":"Depression for me is like being back in school. I could attend every class, study for days, meet with the professor after class, do everything in my power to try to succeed, and still come out with very average grades. Meanwhile, there\u2019s somebody next to me who missed classes, barely studied, and likely went out for drinks the night before, and they got an A on the final.Take that example, and now apply it to life: It\u2019s a big, exhausting game of spinning plates for an average outcome. Shockingly, that\u2019s not super motivating.The headlines and articles are everywhere: \u201c10 Ways to Be Happier,\u201d \u201cStop Doing These Five Things if You\u2019re Depressed,\u201d \u201cHow to Combat Seasonal Depression.\u201d But there comes a point when these vague, one-size-fits-all solutions might be hurting, instead of helping, people who struggle with depression.Of course it\u2019s good to go outside, to read more, to get exercise, seek therapy, put bright colors in your house, try essential oils, take baths, meditate, try yoga\u2026 but for fuck\u2019s sake, what an exhausting list of activities to maintain. Suggesting that somebody who struggles to even get out of bed some days just needs to go for a walk isn\u2019t helpful.I\u2019ve tried everything you can think of to help combat my depression. Along with those \u201clife hacks\u201d mentioned above, I\u2019ve also tried changing my diet, drinking more water, sleeping, using marijuana, getting up earlier before work, talking to my friends and family more, keeping the house clean, more coffee, less coffee, more alcohol, less alcohol, changing jobs, about 10 doctor appointments complete with blood tests, moving, taking supplements (iron, fish oil, magnesium, probiotics, etc.), joining clubs, getting off social media, trying to feng shui my house\u2026 the list is quite frankly endless. The thing that I\u2019ve figured out after two years of this is that it takes a combination of things.\u2026is weightlifting. (Cue eyerolls. I know.) Before depression hit me like a bag of rocks, I was a runner. I wasn\u2019t fast. I wasn\u2019t breaking records. But half marathons were my jam. There was an end goal to work toward, a plan to get there, milestones I could check off \u2014 it was a dream for my type-A personality. I just finished my fourth half marathon earlier this year, and it was hell getting there. I was training while my energy was so low that, by the time the average day was over, I was so exhausted from just existing that I couldn\u2019t bring myself to run anymore. It was too much.I soon found that lifting was surprisingly more approachable than running. I could leave my 9-5 job and still have energy to go sling around weights in the gym. Six months in, and I still can\u2019t tell you why my body is able to get out the door to lift but not run. It could be the ability to rest between sets. It could be my recent interest in powerlifting and the shorter reps associated with that. It could just be that it\u2019s something different and I have a heightened desire to take on a new challenge.Eventually, I realized I\u2019m not doing anything wrong and there isn\u2019t a magic solution.There\u2019s something therapeutic about the repetitive motions of a deadlift, squat, bench, or clean jerk. I can zone out and crush it, like I used to do with running. I\u2019m able to surprise myself on a near-daily basis with how much I can lift. This isn\u2019t bragging. I\u2019m not the Hulk, but it really boosts your self-esteem to do something you originally thought you couldn\u2019t.And I obviously don\u2019t mind the physical changes happening in my body. After years of seeing no changes in myself mentally, it\u2019s really nice to at least be able to see changes physically. More importantly, my mentality is better because of it.But, of course, weightlifting isn\u2019t a cure. The thing about depression is it sucks. It\u2019s exhausting, consuming, seemingly never-ending, and sometimes embarrassing. It varies person to person, but if you can muster up the smallest bit of strength, try to find the thing that makes a difference for you.I\u2019d been spending my time searching for a solution to my depression. I wanted to try everyone\u2019s suggestions to figure out what I was doing wrong. Eventually, I realized I\u2019m not doing anything wrong and there isn\u2019t a magic solution.I\u2019m not cured, and I haven\u2019t discovered anything life-changing, but I do feel like I\u2019ve come a long way in finding what works for me. It wasn\u2019t the self-help books and articles. Nothing I\u2019ve read helped me arrive at this conclusion. Nothing I saw pushed me to lifting.Trying to manage depression can become an obnoxious guessing game, but every guess is a move, and any move is a path forward\u2014and that\u2019s the important thing.Written byWritten byAbout this Anthology","10470":"Obesity is such an emotionally charged issue in large part because it has become entangled with a person\u2019s willpower and character. This makes it different from almost every other disease due to the unspoken accusation that you did it to yourself.Many physicians unconsciously engage in fat shaming because they believe that pointing out the many ways a person could\u2019ve done better gives patients extra motivation to lose weight. As if the whole world was not reminding them every single day.When it comes to fat shaming, I believe the camp that\u2019s popularized the \u201cCalories In, Calories Out\u201d (CICO) mentality are responsible for a share of the blame. I\u2019m talking about physicians and researchers who constantly insist that \u201ca calorie is a calorie\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s all about calories\u201d or \u201ceat less, move more.\u201d What they actually imply with this rhetoric is \u201cit\u2019s all your fault.\u201d Instead of treating the disease of obesity with compassion and understanding, this mentality infuses it with personal shame. I\u2019m here to argue that calories in versus calories out is a pack of lies fed to us by corporate interests.Obesity has come to be understood as a fundamental imbalance of energy and calories. This is a crucial mistake.If you develop breast cancer, for example, nobody secretly thinks you should have done more to prevent it. Nobody condescendingly tells you to \u201cget with the program.\u201d If you have a heart attack, you don\u2019t face accusations. Yet obesity has become a disease singularly unique in its association with shame. CICO folks imply that if you could just stop eating and stop being lazy, you too could look like Brad Pitt. But it\u2019s not true. Instead, this deflects the blame for the obesity epidemic from ineffective dietary advice that\u2019s been peddled for decades.Obesity has come to be understood as a fundamental imbalance of energy and calories. This is a crucial mistake. As I argue in my book The Obesity Code, this obsessive fixation on calories needs to stop.Up until the 1970s, there was little obesity, and people had virtually no idea how many calories they ate or burned. Yet, without effort, people all around the world lived without obesity.If the majority of people were able to avoid obesity without counting calories, then how did counting calories become so fundamental to weight stability since 1980? There are two main changes in the American diet since the 1970s. First, we were advised to lower the amount of fat in our diet and increase the amount of carbohydrates. The push to eat more white bread and pasta turned out not to be particularly slimming. But there\u2019s also another problem that largely flew under the radar: the increase in meal frequency.In the 1970s, people typically ate three times per day: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.By 2004, the number of meals eaten per day had increased closer to six per day\u2014almost double. Now, snacking was not just an indulgence, it was encouraged as a healthy behavior. Meal skipping was heavily frowned upon.The admonishments against meal skipping were especially loud. Doctors and dietitians told patients to never ever skip a meal. Yet from a physiological standpoint, if you don\u2019t eat, your body will burn some body fat to get the energy it needs. That\u2019s all that happens. It\u2019s the entire purpose the body carries fat in the first place. We store fat so we can use it. If we don\u2019t eat, our bodies use the body fat.As people gained more weight, the calls for people to eat more and more frequently grew louder. Doctors would say to cut calories and eat constantly\u2014graze, like a dairy cow in a pasture.People with obesity are victims of poor advice to eat more often and lower dietary fat in a desperate effort to reduce caloric intake.But the advice didn\u2019t work. Either the dietary advice for weight loss was bad, or the advice was good, but the person was not following it. I believe that the former is correct. Therefore, people with obesity are victims of poor advice to eat more often and lower dietary fat in a desperate effort to reduce caloric intake. Their weight problems are a symptom of a failure to understand the disease of obesity. I do not believe they have low willpower or weak character. Many physicians and researchers believe the latter conclusion. They believe the problem is the patients. But that conclusion suggests that the obesity epidemic is the result of a worldwide collective simultaneous loss of willpower and character. Was this obesity crisis actually a crisis of weak willpower?Somewhere around 40 percent of the U.S. adult population is classified as obese and 70 percent are overweight or obese. Suppose a teacher has a class of 100 children. If one student fails, that may certainly be the child\u2019s fault. Perhaps they didn\u2019t study. But if 70 children are failing, then is it not more likely the teacher\u2019s fault? In obesity medicine, the problem was never with the patient. The problem was the faulty dietary advice patients were given.This is why obesity is not only a disease with dire health consequences but a disease that comes with a lot of shame. People blame themselves because everybody tells them it is their fault. Nutritional authorities throw around the euphemism \u201cpersonal responsibility.\u201d But it\u2019s not.The real problem is an underlying assumption that obesity is all about calories eaten versus calories burned. The natural conclusion of this line of thinking is that if you are obese, \u201cit\u2019s your fault\u201d and you \u201clet yourself go.\u201d You either failed to control your eating or did not exercise enough. But obesity is not a disorder of too many calories. I argue it\u2019s a hormonal imbalance of hyperinsulinemia. Cutting calories when the problem is insulin is not going to work.Not only do people with weight problems suffer all the physical health issues\u2014type 2 diabetes, joint problems, etc.\u2014but they\u2019re also shamed for it. It\u2019s time for the medical community to admit its mistakes and stop playing the patient blame game.Written byWritten by","10497":"\u201cWhat am I living for and what am I dying for are the same question.\u201d\u2015Margaret AtwoodAs children, we had to ask for permission from our parents or caretakers to do what we wanted. Whether it was hanging out with friends, going outside, or whatever rules were placed on us, we had to ask. And being children, this was often important to keep us safe.But many of us carry this need into adulthood. We believe we need permission from our parents, friends, and even society when it comes to living the life we want. We hold on to tradition \u2014 the tradition of what everyone else has done and what everyone else believes we should do.The problem is we give up what we want as individuals. We seek permission from others about how to live our lives. We seek approval for what we should study in college, what job we should take, and which partner we should date. And we want to follow what others deem to be \u201cbest\u201d for us.I understand a lot of wanting to seek permission is based on respect for the person whom we are seeking permission from. But if it goes against what you want, you are not respecting yourself and your life.Because continually seeking permission (and approval) from others will not make you happy. Eventually, you will realize you have been living your life for others, and you\u2019ve missed out on the life you wanted.\u201cThere is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you.\u201d\u2015Maya AngelouWhether you are 26 or 46 (and don\u2019t live with your parents), your life is yours. You may seek the advice of peers and family, but the decision on how you should live life is yours. There may be consequences to your decisions, but you don\u2019t need permission to live your life how you see fit. And despite what we are told all the time, being selfish on occasion is something which is healthy.You will make mistakes, and you will make some stupid decisions. I have. But it is all part of growth and finding out who you are and what you want. It is part of living your own life and figuring out what it means to you.When you start to figure out what you want in life, you may change your mind about a lot of the thoughts you previously had. And you also have permission to do that.You have permission to change your mind about whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter. It could be politics, religion, pursuing a career, or a college major. It\u2019s alright to change your mind. Not only is it alright it\u2019s a right. It\u2019s your right.You don\u2019t have to seek permission to live your life or change your mind, and you also need to be a little stubborn when it comes to living the life you want. I\u2019m not saying to not seek advice or wisdom from those who may have more experience, but their life is not yours. Their experience does not equate to what is best for you \u2014 only you can determine that. And usually, their want for you comes from a place of fear \u2014 their fear. But you can\u2019t let their fear be yours.To live how you want, there must be a willingness to give up certain things like tradition, the \u201cnormal\u201d, and what others want you to do. You will face detractors and people who believe you are crazy.The question you need to ask yourself is what are you willing to give up to live the life you want?That will be up to you and only you.But remember, you have permission to live the life you want. It\u2019s already in your hands. It\u2019s been granted. You just have to find what that life looks like.Get my new book here!Originally published at jeffthewriter.com on December 10, 2018.If you liked this, you may also like these:Written byWritten by","10513":"Science-backed techniques to maximize your brain powerFrom the time you got up this morning till the end of the day, you\u2019ll make about 70 deliberate decisions. That\u2019s 2,000 judgement calls, every month of your life.If you\u2019re careless or overconfident or distracted, you\u2019ll make mistakes. And mistakes always cost us. It\u2019s just a matter of how much.Mess up the project at work and you\u2019ll be staying back late to fix it. Make the wrong call in training, and you\u2019ll waste everyone\u2019s time. Miss something in combat, and its life or death for those around you.So how do you stop this from happening?By looking after your brain. Because if you want to consistently make good decisions, you need to always be mentally at your best.Here are the daily techniques used by military professionals throughout history to train their brain, feed it, and build their mental firepower. And it\u2019s all backed by science.Napoleon Bonaparte is considered a military strategic genius. At the Battle of Austerlitz he famously defeated the Russian and Austrian Empires by predicting exactly where and when the enemy would attack.You might know about the Napoleonic Wars and how he revolutionized warfare. What you probably don\u2019t know is what he ate for breakfast.According to his second assistant, Napoleon was served a combination of the following dishes:\u201cBoiled or poached eggs, an omelette, a small leg of mutton, a filet of beef, broiled breast of lamb or a chicken wing, lentils, or beans in a salad.\u201dIn other words, he ate protein for breakfast. Lots of protein.How does his diet stack up with what we know today?Swiss researchers decided to test the best breakfast for our brains. They gave 15 healthy male students three types of breakfast over the space of 3 weeks. One breakfast meal was based on carbohydrates, one meal was an equal mix of protein and carbohydrates, and one meal was protein rich. Then they tested the students\u2019 attention, reaction times and short-term memory over the next 3 \u00bd hours.Students performed worst with the carbohydrates breakfast \u2014 there was some mild improvement up to the first 60 minutes, but then they went backwards. When they had the protein breakfast or mixed breakfast, attention and reaction times were significantly improved over the 3 \u00bd hours. Short term memory was strongest after the protein breakfast, and reaction times were faster after the mixed meal. The study concluded a protein-rich breakfast, or mix of protein and carbs results in better overall cognitive performance.The best military professionals start the day eating like a 19th century French General. To be at your physical and mental peak, cut away the breakfast cereal. It\u2019s all about the protein.The Roman Emperor and General Marcus Aurelius was a busy man. He had an Empire to run, Germanic tribes to repel, and the Parthian Empire to defeat. Yet he still found time for daily meditation.Every morning he would visualize how he would respond to the challenges ahead.People couldn\u2019t injure him, or drag him down, or make him angry, unless he let them. He trained his mind, so he could control his emotions, and succeed as an Emperor and General.He wasn\u2019t the only military professional to make this part of his daily ritual. Hagakure taught that a Samurai should meditate daily about their death. By visualizing all the ways they could be killed, when the time came to fight they would be able to do so without fear.Today meditation is practiced by modern militaries around the world. It\u2019s been introduced into US Marines training. Professional sports star and CEOs swear by it. And now the scientists have gotten on board.Can meditation make you smarter? Yes, according to a University of North Carolina study.Researchers wanted to see if mediation would make people perform better in cognitive testing. So they gave one group 20 minutes of meditation training for four days in a row, while another group listened to J.R.R.Tolkien audio-books. Before and after each session, both groups were tested on various cognitive functions.After only four days, the meditation group did significantly better on all the tests, and particularly on tests conducted under stressful conditions (in this case, time pressure) where they performed 10 times better.It turns out the meditation training was a workout for the brain. It taught the volunteers to block out distracting thoughts and senses, and focus completely on the task at hand.There\u2019s a reason everyone from the Romans to the Samurai practiced daily meditation. So if you don\u2019t already, add a few minutes of self-reflection, visualization and concentration to your morning schedule \u2014 it\u2019s training which will improve your memory, attention span and reaction times. When you stay alert, you stay alive.The Duke of Wellington was a 19th century British officer and statesman. He is best known for leading Anglo-Allied forces in defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo.Strong, healthy and an avid horse rider, he would go for a brisk 30 minute walk each morning to limber up.He also introduced fitness regimes for his soldiers.By starting the morning with a 30 minute session, was the Duke onto something?We now know exercise makes you smarter. Researchers at the University of British Columbia even found regular exercise boosts the size of the hippocampus \u2014 the part of the brain involved in verbal memory and learning.But it\u2019s day-to-day impact is a little bit more complicated. It turns out your physical training can help or hurt your mental performance. It all depends on the length and type of workout.Our cognitive performance increases after a 20\u201340 minute aerobic workout at sub-maximal intensity \u2014 up to 85% of your maximum heart rate. Athletes given motor skill and cognitive tests before and after this type of workout, performed better after the workout session.Even 10 minutes of aerobic exercise is enough for a brain boost. In a recent study, healthy adults were tested on decision-making and problem solving. Half the group then cycled at a moderate-to-vigorous pace for 10 minutes, while the other half read a magazine.When re-tested a short time later, the cycling group had a 14% improvement in reaction times, with no loss of accuracy (the reading group showed no difference).Which is all pretty impressive. But here\u2019s the catch. Increase the duration of your workout too much, and your mental performance goes backwards. Particularly once you become dehydrated.In one study, a 2 hour run on a treadmill at 65% of sub-maximal intensity lead to a significant reduction in short-term memory, fine motor skills such as movement and coordination, and the ability to identify differences in visual images. When given recovery fluids, it took 3 \u00bd hours for the participants mental capacity to recover.So to be at your sharpest, start your day with a 20\u201340 minute aerobic session \u2014running, swimming, cycling, or brisk walking like the Duke. Leave the rucking for a Friday. And recognize post- PT Challenge is not a good time to be making important decisions.Winston Churchill was Britain\u2019s Prime Minister during World War II. Before this, he had served in the British military, seeing action in British India, the Anglo-Sudan War and the Second Boer War.How did he stay at the top of his game for five years as a wartime leader?He had an afternoon nap. Every single day.After that he would wake up refreshed, and ready to work into the early hours of the morning.He wrote in his memoirs:\u201cNature had not intended mankind to work from 8am in the morning to midnight without the refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts 20 minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces.\u201dHe claimed his afternoon nap \u2014 which lasted up to 2 hrs \u2014 gave him two days in one.The science backs his claim. A review in the Journal of Sleep Research reported even healthy, well-rested people show improvements in reaction time, logical reasoning and symbol recognition after a daytime nap. Whereas not sleeping for 17\u201319 hours is equivalent to having a blood alcohol level of 0.05.So how long should your afternoon nap be?For a quick boost, go for 10\u201320 minutes. One study showed a 10 minute nap led to significant improvements in alertness and cognitive performance compared to no nap. You\u2019re still in the light stages of the sleep cycle, so its easy to get up and start work again.The ultimate nap time is 90 to 120 minutes, sometime between 1pm and 4pm. This is long enough for one full sleep cycle which means you won\u2019t wake up too groggy. The result is improvements in creativity, and emotional and long-term memory.Churchill was a night owl. He would work late into the night, and sleep from 3am to 8am. Which means altogether, he was still getting the recommended 7\u20138 hours.This gave him staying power. And not just as a wartime leader \u2014 he lived to 90. Which reflects scientific findings that people who sleep 7\u20138 hours live the longest (and those who reduce their sleep to 5 hours or less have 1.7 times the risk of premature death).The sharpest military professionals know sleep is essential. If Winston Churchill could find two hours every afternoon as a wartime leader in World War II, you can squeeze in a 10 minute power nap to recharge (here\u2019s the combat tested method to unwind and sleep anywhere in 120 seconds).Imagine being able to think clearer, and react faster. To reason better and retain information longer. To deploy knowing you are able to block out any distracting thoughts and focus completely on the task at hand. No matter how many things are going on around you, or how much pressure you\u2019re under.You\u2019ll stay alert longer. Your decisions will be better. And you won\u2019t make life-threatening mistakes.While others may fatigue and fade, you\u2019ll have the techniques to guarantee peak mental performance. A daily routine to keep you sharp, calm, and in control.Sources:Louis \u00c9tienne Saint-Denis, Napoleon from the Tuileries to St. Helena, translated by Frank Hunter Potter (New York and London, 1922), pp. 175\u2013176Winston Churchill, The Gathering Storm: The first volume of The Second World War (Brooklyn, 1989)Written byWritten by","10565":"Doctors are especially skilled at a few things. Prescribing medications? Absolutely. Performing surgery? For sure. Nutrition and weight loss? No, definitely not.You might be a little stunned to hear that admission coming from a trained medical specialist like myself. But whether a physician has expertise regarding diet often comes down to their training and what they view as their circle of competence.Generally speaking, during the four years of medical school, the total amount of time spent on nutrition is about 10 to 20 hours.Medical training extends more than a decade, and yet there is barely any attention paid to nutrition or the equally thorny question of how a person should approach weight loss. In medical school, a standard curricula may include a mandated number of hours for nutrition, which can vary greatly depending on where a physician is trained. Generally speaking, during the four years of medical school, the total amount of time spent on nutrition is about 10 to 20 hours. I did my medical training at the University of Toronto and the University of California, Los Angeles, and my experience was not unlike most other schools in North America.Medical school consisted of nutrition lectures where we discussed things like the biochemical pathways of vitamin K metabolism or how vitamin D is activated in the kidney and skin. Yes, perhaps you might consider these subjects nutrition, but they are really much closer to biochemistry. I learned vitamin D becomes 25-OH vitamin D in the kidneys and then becomes activated in the skin during sun exposure to the active 1,25-OH vitamin D. So, not very useful knowledge when you\u2019re trying to understand how to help people lose weight.We also learned about fairly uncommon diseases like scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and pellagra. Gums bleeding and hair follicles that are corkscrewed? Avast, ye mateys. Knowledge of these ailments certainly came in handy during exams\u2014and also for the last patient I diagnosed with them, which was, uh, never. While scurvy is certainly important to identify and treat, it\u2019s substantially more likely that doctors like me will encounter someone with a disease like obesity or diabetes. It\u2019s also likely that doctors are not completely equipped to treat those diseases.I graduated medical school with essentially zero knowledge of nutrition as most people know it. What people really want to know are things like, should I eat more carbs? Less carbs? More fat? Less fat? Is sugar bad? How do I lose weight? Those important health questions are apparently not considered the purview of many medical school teachings.I\u2019ve found that medical school provided less training in real-life nutritional questions than most health clubs or gyms. As a result, doctors can be trained to believe that nutrition and weight loss are simply not part of the problems they deal with or should care about. Medical students model their own self-image as a doctor on the mentors they meet in medical school. And those doctors and researchers often don\u2019t prioritize nutrition or weight loss.This contrasts starkly with the medical knowledge doctors do learn about. Everybody, and certainly every medical student, knows that obesity plays a dominant role in metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. In turn, these metabolic diseases raise the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, kidney disease, blindness, amputations, and much more. Doctors understand the importance of weight gain in relation to disease, but not necessarily enough to educate themselves on how to lose weight or what people should or should not eat.Given the knowledge that weight gain can lead to metabolic disease and other conditions like heart disease or diabetes, you\u2019d assume a natural question from the medical community would be: What can I do to prevent or reverse weight gain (i.e., what\u2019s the root cause)?Doctors often tell patients to lose weight. What they don\u2019t often tell patients, however, is how to lose weight.Instead, a doctor can be trained to think: weight gain can lead to metabolic disease and other problems like heart attacks. What drugs or surgery should I give to patients after they have their heart attack?Obesity and metabolic disease are destroying our nation\u2019s health, yet medical schools still do not adequately teach medical students or residents how to actually treat these problems. Doctors often tell patients to lose weight. What they don\u2019t often tell patients, however, is how to lose weight.The entire medical school curriculum about weight loss largely comes down to the old advice: Eat less. Move more. Cut about 500 calories per day, and you will lose about a pound of fat per week. If there\u2019s a new drug for, say, lung cancer, doctors immediately want to know: Does it work? For weight loss, we learn about this calorie-cutting method, but nobody seems to ask: Does it work?We already know it doesn\u2019t. People have tried this weight loss method for the last 50 years, and more often than not, it\u2019s not effective over the long term. Most studies on calorie restriction for weight loss fail in one way or another. The success rate is about 1 percent. Doctors were trained to give weight loss advice that had an expected failure rate of 99 percent. What boggles the mind is why doctors don\u2019t stop and think about why they\u2019re giving advice that is expected to fail 99 percent of the time. The most unfair part is that when patients return, unable to lose weight, they\u2019re often blamed for their failure. It\u2019s so much easier to blame the patient than to find fault in the standard medical advice of cutting calories.The problem is medical students are subjected to enormous unconscious bias. Many doctors they know and learn from are not making nutrition a primary part of their practice. The understanding that nutrition is not something doctors do permeates. We prescribe medications. We perform surgery. But we don\u2019t help with weight loss, even if it is the root cause of many of the diseases we see today. Thankfully there are other professionals who study nutrition, like registered dietitians, but it makes no sense that doctors do as little as possible to address this blatant underlying health problem.Does this change after medical school? Yes, I argue it gets worse. Speciality training, internship, residency, and fellowship are another five years of training after medical school where there is typically no formal curriculum around nutrition. That\u2019s another five years where doctors learn that weight loss has nothing to do with them. Leave it up to Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, and magazines. But not medicine.Should you talk to your doctor about weight loss? Would you ask your plumber to remove your wisdom teeth? Would you ask your barista to check your vision? It doesn\u2019t have to be this way, of course. The obvious solution is to include more nutrition in the curriculum of medical schools or residency training. It would also help if doctors learn a bit more of the physiology behind weight loss and weight gain, more about the hormonal regulators of weight and how to influence them using diet. If doctors truly want people to be well, they must start caring about nutrition and guiding people through weight loss. There\u2019s no longer any excuse not to.Written byWritten by","10636":"There are several popular diets these days that prohibit eating any grains. In particular, The Paleo Diet, The Ketogenic Diet, and Whole30 Diet are three of the hottest diets right now, and none of them allow for any grains.It is true that cutting out grains will help with weight loss in the short term, but eliminating whole grains is detrimental to long-term health.The evidence clearly shows that whole grains promote health and should be a part of any effective eating plan.Specifically, eating just 2\u20133 portions of whole grains per day has been shown to reduce the risk of getting a heart attack or prematurely dying of heart disease by 30%, and lower the risk of all forms of cardiovascular disease (heart attack, stroke, or the need for a procedure to bypass or open a clogged artery) by 21%.Those numbers mean that eating enough whole grains daily is as powerful as high blood pressure medications in alleviating hypertension.Considering 75 million American adults have high blood pressure \u2014 one in every three American adults \u2014 we would be smart to consume more whole grains, not less.But whole grains do much more than just lower blood pressure.Eating at least 70 grams of whole grains daily has been shown to lower the risk of total mortality by 22% and reduce the risk of cancer mortality by 20%.Whole grain consumption has also been shown to lower cholesterol and protect against inflammation in the body.It should come as no surprise that people are encouraged to load up on whole grains on the Mediterranean Diet, which was just named the #1 healthiest diet by a panel of the nation\u2019s foremost nutrition experts.Whole grains also play a key role in centenarians\u2019 diets in every Blue Zones region in the world. That means the longest-lived people in the world eat whole grains daily.Grains in general get a bad rap because of all the processed refined grains that exist in our food system today.Refined grains (like white bread and white rice) are stripped of valuable nutrients in the refining process, including the removal of the germ and bran.That is a problem because bran is filled with fiber and other nutrients that help regulate blood sugar, prevent blood clots, and lower cholesterol.And the germ is packed with healthy fats, vitamin E, B vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants.Once the bran and germ are removed, the only part of the grain that is left is the soft, chewy, easy-to-digest endosperm. That\u2019s why white flour is fluffy and tastes so good, but it is missing most of the nutrition (and food manufacturers add lots of other junk to refined grains these days).Whole grains offer a \u201ccomplete package\u201d of health benefits, but all three parts of the whole grain \u2014 the bran, germ, and endosperm \u2014 need to be intact to reap those benefits.Whereas refined grains are associated with a range of negative health outcomes, from obesity to diabetes to heart disease.It is therefore critical to select and eat actual whole grains, instead of the processed and refined stuff.By now, hopefully you are convinced of the importance of whole grains, but it can still be confusing to buy truly nutritious whole grain products.That is because words like multigrain, whole grain, and whole wheat show up on nearly every package of food these days, and it is very misleading.To help simplify the process, your best bet is to choose an unprocessed whole grain in its natural form (which means just one ingredient).Popular, easy-to-find unprocessed whole grains include brown rice, barley, corn, quinoa, oats, rye, wheat berries, and wild rice.If you do opt for whole grain bread or pasta with more than one ingredient, you need to look on the back of the label and perform some basic math to ensure you are really getting whole grains without the unhealthy additives.Specifically, look at the label and make sure the serving size ratio of carbs to fiber is equal to or less than 5-to-1 (for example, if you divided 15 grams of carbs by 3 grams of fiber like in the Ezekiel 4:9 sprouted whole grain bread, that would equal 5 and would pass the test).Following the 5-to-1 rule is the way to buy healthy whole grain products, according to Dr. Michael Greger, author of the groundbreaking book How Not To Die.Whole grains should make up roughly 1\/4 of your overall diet, according to the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate, the official dietary advice from Harvard doctors and medical professors (fruits and vegetables should account for at least half your plate, and the remaining 1\/4 should be healthy protein).In general, you want to aim for at least three servings of whole grains per day (one serving is equal to half cup of cooked brown rice, one slice of whole grain bread, or a cup of whole grain cereal).I typically eat two slices of whole grain toast in the morning (topped with olive oil or peanut butter) to cover off on two of the servings, and then I try to add in some brown rice, quinoa, corn, or whole grain pasta for lunch or dinner. Oatmeal is another easy option to start your day with whole grains. And popcorn (unflavored and without added salt) is an incredibly simple whole grain snack.It doesn\u2019t matter which whole grains you eat, as long as you eat enough of them overall. Select the whole grains you like best.Don\u2019t be confused by trendy diets that eliminate all grains. You might lose some weight in the short term, but it\u2019s not worth sacrificing your long-term health.A variety of whole grains should be included in any healthy eating plan. True whole grains are nutrient-dense and protective against many of our most dreaded diseases.Processed refined grains should be avoided, but you should be eating whole grains every day for optimum health.Written byWritten by","10673":"It\u2019s a well-known trend that new beginnings are bright, hopeful points for people. This time of year is when we can most easily convince ourselves that we can change.It\u2019s aspirational: by committing to working out, eating \u201cright,\u201d making better choices, maybe we\u2019ll become the kind of people who naturally love eating raw almonds, waking up at the crack of dawn, meditating before work and keeping a gratitude journal.And we\u2019re never more susceptible to this kind of flawed thinking than at big new beginnings.What\u2019s less well-known is that it doesn\u2019t have to be a whole New Year for people to start believing the new time unit will help them change. Searches on Google for healthy terms like \u201cdiet\u201d spike on month beginnings, and on Monday mornings.If you think about it, it\u2019s arbitrary. January 1st is not any better a date to turning your life around than December 31st, or March 2nd. But somehow the start of a New Year grants us (briefly) the inspiration to change ourselves. People love the chance to restart the clock, even if the clock is imaginary.This New Year\u2019s Eve, I didn\u2019t set any goals. I didn\u2019t make any resolutions. I didn\u2019t write down any quantifiable things I wanted to change about myself in order to be a better person.What did I do instead? I drank, with my friends. We played a lot of silly party games and ate a lot of silly party food. I wasn\u2019t thinking about the weight I want to lose, or the habits I want to start.I was fully in the moment, enjoying myself with my people, and hoping they were too.That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to work on myself at all. It just means I don\u2019t wait for a \u201cnew\u201d beginning as my trigger to change.But when you take each new start, be it day, month or year as the catalyst for change, it does two bad things.First, it puts pressure on you. You have this reason, this motivation, given to you by the Universe it seems, to start over. You think that\u2019s going to give you enough momentum to carry out your goals.However, that\u2019s not the case. There\u2019s four decades\u2019 worth of research about how and why humans manage to set and fulfil goals, and most of it points out that we need more than just changing our calendars to fuel long-lasting, meaningful change.\u201cPeople don\u2019t just make resolutions and then the next day spring into lasting action.\u201d \u2014 Christine Carter, PhD and sociologist.And the second reason is that if your New Year\u2019s Goals fail, as most resolutions do, there\u2019s always next year. Your brain starts to rely on that impetus artificially granted by a change in time, rather than the internal drive you need to actually change.Instead of reflecting on your reasons for wanting to change and using that as your motivation when you stumble, or analyzing the reasons you might not have succeeded this time, you just tell yourself you can try again next year.If you really, deeply and truly want to make change in your life, don\u2019t wait for the New Year. You don\u2019t need it and it won\u2019t help you.This New Year\u2019s Eve, I drank less than I might have a year ago. I ate more green stuff and less beige stuff out of the party snack selection. Instead of getting a cab, I walked home.None of this was for a New Year\u2019s Resolution \u2014 I generally want to drink less, make healthier choices and spend less money on transportation. Instead of making those into resolutions, I decided what I wanted to change about myself, thought about why and the benefits it would bring, and considered some steps I could take.I still drank some. I still ate crap. But I also still counted that as progress towards my aim. Instead of feeling guilty because I\u2019d failed any \u201cgoals,\u201d I felt pride and happiness that I was already succeeding.My motivation wasn\u2019t just \u201cNew Year, New Me.\u201dI want to be a better version of myself over the long term. Not in some instant transformation, but in slow, plodding steps that end up with me a happier, healthier, version of me. Lofty New Year\u2019s Resolutions won\u2019t help me achieve those aims, but regular old daily work will.Written byWritten by","10752":"Every night that my boyfriend is away, I do something I\u2019m not proud of.I go to the bathroom, get the surgical tape out from where I\u2019ve hidden it under my toenail clippers, and stand in front of the mirror.By angling my head back and forth under the light, I can just about make out the beginnings of my \u201celevens\u201d.Note: elevens are not a wonderful mid-morning snack as I once mistakenly believed, but in fact a wrinkle caused by furrowing your brows.Carefully, I apply the micropore tape to my forehead, pulling the skin until it\u2019s taut and smooth. That way, I can\u2019t frown in my sleep, which I suspect is contributing to my premature wrinklage.I\u2019m in my mid-twenties. I firmly believe a woman\u2019s appearance should not contribute to her overall worth. I know, logically, that nobody but me sees or notices these lines between my brows. I know that even if they did, most people would not think any less of me.And yet here I stand, under the bathroom lights, satisfied that my forehead is completely and artificially immobilized.One issue is representation. If you look at any woman in media at any age, you\u2019ll notice she does not have forehead wrinkles. The venerable Meryl Streep, age 69, has a nearly unlined forehead.That\u2019s not normal for the vast majority of people, but it\u2019s what we\u2019re overwhelmingly presented with in the media. What\u2019s worse is that it\u2019s socially unacceptable to confess you\u2019ve artificially achieved your youthful look with surgery, so famous women continue telling us that they\u2019re just naturally unwrinkled.Another issue is our hatred and fear of age. Especially in this part of the world, age is something to be feared; aging people themselves are to be packed away and ignored. Signs of aging are derided, mocked, and avoided at all costs.\u201cIn your late 20s to mid-30s, you enter a pre-aging.\u201d \u2014 New York dermatologist Dr. Kavita Mariwalla.This is especially marketed towards women, something you can see if you check out older men in Hollywood who do seem capable of showing wrinkles:These two factors intersect neatly in an industry which is outright called \u201canti-aging\u201d without any attempt at disguising the fact that they hate age, producing a revenue of 200 billion USD this year, estimated to increase to 216 billion USD by 2021.The people making and marketing these products derive their living from:a) pretending normal women don\u2019t age; andb) convincing women that any signs that you\u2019re falling prey to old age are worth paying (a lot of) money to be avoided.When I add these stupid anti-ageing forehead tape triangles to my Amazon shopping cart, these people win because they have successfully persuaded me that I would rather spend seventeen dollars to put tape triangles on my forehead at night than I would show an infinitesimal wrinkle.My boyfriend, three years older than me, has what I would consider deep wrinkles on his forehead. He has crow\u2019s feet around his eyes.You know why they\u2019re there? Because he smiles a lot. He raises his eyebrows when he\u2019s surprised, confused, angry, dismayed. He squints when he\u2019s out in the sun. He never moisturizes.\u201cThe best way to battle aging, however, is to take preventative measures. Even as early as your 20\u2019s, you can (and should) be using anti-aging skin care products!\u201d \u2014 Alana Mitchell, licensed esthetician.And yet it would never occur to him to purchase any anti-aging products. Nor, to me, do these lines look out of place on his face. They\u2019re just signs of life. They happen to him, unavoidably. Age is a function of time.But this leniency I generously grant him does not extend to myself. I moisturize every morning, pat my face dry rather than rubbing, apply sunscreen religiously (not to avoid skin damage, but to avoid fine wrinkles) and tape my forehead at night.I scan women\u2019s foreheads for signs I\u2019m not alone. I google the veracity of anti-age creams to see if the miracles they promise really could turn back the clock for me. And the worst part is, I know I\u2019m being ridiculous.I know the whole thing is a scam, a racket that profits off of my self-doubt and the fact that my sense of self-worth stems from my appearance. And I still can\u2019t stop.And I know that I am not alone.\u201cAnti-aging products, particularly those with antioxidants, can be used as early as age 21, but the most important thing is to use anti-aging products that are appropriate for your skin type,\u201d Rouleau, celebrity esthetician.As early as 21, we are being pushed into spending a lot of money to ensure our skin looks fresh, young, and unlined. We are instilled with a fear of age, of showing our years, with a desperation to stop time. Even as young as 21, we are told that the lines on our forehead, the freckles on our arms, are signs that we have failed to look after ourselves and that we will rue the day we didn\u2019t purchase and apply this $310 pot of eye cream.There\u2019s no real answer to solving this issue. All I can do is try to make my peace with the fact that I\u2019m going to have wrinkles, spots, forehead dimples, lines, and every other aging sign. And I can try to change my mindset to embrace them as signs of a life lived, rather than just unsightly blemishes.Written byWritten by","10828":"In 2005, National Geographic writer Dan Buettner described certain areas of the world where people lived longer, healthier lives as \u201cBlue Zones.\u201d This includes:People living in these Blue Zone locations reach their 90s and even past 100 (called centenarians) with relatively little age-related disease. Although spread throughout the world, with seemingly widely divergent diets and lifestyles, they all share certain characteristics that may help them live longer, fuller lives. These people often smoke less, move more (and at a moderate level), and prioritize family and socializing above all else. Their diet is often, but not always plant based, with relatively low protein intake, especially from animals. This, by itself proves nothing as most of the world\u2019s diets are plant based but it is instructive to look a little more closely at the diets of these longevity superstars to learn their secrets. You can read more about the science of longevity in The Longevity Solution.Across the world, the average number of people who live to be over 100 years of age is only 6.2 per 100,000. According to their 2017 census, Japan boasted the world\u2019s highest proportion at 34.85 per 100,000 population. But the tiny Japanese prefecture of Okinawa, in 1990 crushed even that number with an astounding 39.5 per 100,000. Okinawan men typically live to the age of 84, while the women average 90 years, despite being Japan\u2019s poorest prefecture with the lowest number of physicians per capita.Further, they suffer small fractions of the rates of diseases that typically kill Westerners: 20% the rate of heart disease and breast and prostate cancer, and less than half the rate of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Tellingly, the diet in Okinawa changed significantly in recent years, becoming more Westernized and by year 2000, the Okinawan longevity advantage had largely vanished. Nevertheless, good data about the traditional diet of Okinawa can give us clues to their longevity.The traditional diet of Okinawans was about 80% carbohydrates, consisting of sweet potatoes, vegetables, and some grains. Just after World War II, Okinawans got nearly 70% of their calories from low-protein, nutrient and fiber dense sweet potatoes alone. This is virtually the opposite of the Standard American Diet, low in nutrients (particularly potassium, magnesium, vitamin C, and carotenoids) and fiber. Along with the ubiquitous sweet potato,other vegetables and legumes made up about 10% of the diet, rice and other grains nearly 20%. In 1988, the daily intake of pulses (beans) was 30% above Japan\u2019s national average, and the intake of green and yellow vegetables was 50% higher.The traditional Okinawan diet contains some meat, particularly pork, along with plenty of plants. The oldest existing record of Japanese diets dates back to 1880 and shows that Okinawans got an astounding 93% of their calories from the sweet potato. They ate just under 40 grams of protein per day, which persisted at least until 1949. Meals consisted of sweet potato, miso soup and plenty of vegetables for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Okinawan sweet potato ranges from red to deep yellow due to the high levels of anthocyanin. They are both very high in polyphenols and anti-oxidants. Okinawa, being a relatively isolated string of sub-tropical islands, has two growing seasons, which favored the production of sweet potatoes and fresh vegetables. Rice grew poorly, and was supplanted as the staple crop by the sweet potato in the 1600s.Once a month, various festivals were held, where meat, particularly fish and pork were consumed. Historically, meat and fish combined were just a paltry 1% of calories, and dairy products and eggs were rare. It was effectively a near-vegan diet, supplying only about 1,800 calories a day (compared to the 2,500 calories of the average American). Over time, meat consumption increased. In the coastal areas, fish was commonly eaten and pork was the other common meat. Pigs were \u2018free range\u2019 and generally ate leftover vegetables, rather than the grains fed to feedlot operations in the West. This results in a higher level of omega-3 fatty acids and lower levels of omega-6 PUFAs.Sodium intake in the Okinawan diet is high, which is characteristic of all Japanese cuisine. This comes from the common use of soy sauce, miso, salted fish and pickled vegetables.One unique facet of Okinawan cuisine is the high consumption of the seaweed konbu. While commonly used in Japanese cuisine for flavoring soups, the Okinawans eat large amounts of the seaweed directly. Konbu, grown in seawater, is high in fibre, minerals and the marine omega 3 fats EPA and DHA. The most popular drink is green tea and kohencha,a semi-fermented tea.This low amount of protein was clearly not detrimental to their health or longevity. Their smaller stature and lower overall muscle mass means this data cannot be directly extrapolated to a muscular weight-lifting American, but it suggests that maybe we don\u2019t need as much protein as we once thought, especially if we\u2019re not doing intense resistance exercise.Meat intake rose steadily in the post-World War II years, and by 1988, surpassed the Japanese average. Meat intake averaged 90 grams per person per day with an equal amount of pulses. Thus, the Okinawans did well with both a very low protein diet and a relatively high protein diet. Most Western cultures have a daily meat intake of more than 200 grams per day. (Note \u2014 a gram of meat is not the same as a gram of protein as meat contains significant fat, depending upon the specific type of meat and cut).There were other changes in the modern Okinawan diet, too. The intake of pulses and green and yellow vegetables declined to the national average. The percent of calories from fat rose above 30%. The most obvious group of residents that have westernized their diet are younger residents and young men. They tend to avoid the traditional champurudish, made with meat (typically pork) or tofu stir fried with vegetables. They also eat less fish than older generations.Okinawa, like most parts of Japan and East Asia drinks copious amounts of tea, particularly green. In Okinawa, green tea is often scented with jasmine flowers and turmeric in a tea they call shan-pien \u2014 loosely translated as \u2018tea with a bit of scent\u2019. The average Okinawan drinks at least 2 cups daily.The Okinawans traditionally follow an ancient Confucian tradition they call \u2018Hari Hachi Bu\u2019. They deliberately stop eating when they are 80% full. This has the same effect as a methodical 20% calorie reduction. They deliberately don\u2019t eat until they are full. They only eat until they are no longer hungry. This is a profound difference. Less obviously, Okinawans must practice what is now called \u2018mindfulness eating\u2019. This is because you must constantly think about whether you are full if you are going to practice Hari Hachi Bu.There are some tips that make this deliberate calorie restriction easier. Remember that when you are eating, eat well. But when you are not eating, don\u2019t eat. Never eat mindlessly. Don\u2019t eat in front of the TV. Don\u2019t eat and read. Don\u2019t eat in front of the computer. Concentrate upon what you are eating and enjoy it. If you are no longer hungry, then stop.Another important tip for Hari Hachi Bu is to eat slowly. Satiety signals in our stomachs take some time to register. If we eat until we are full, it is easy to overshoot. Think about the last time you went to a buffet dinner. As you were eating, everything was fine. But after 10 or 15 minutes later, as all the satiety signals start to hit, you feel too full, and maybe slightly nauseous.Use smaller plates or dishes. This is simply a way to force yourself to deliberately get less food. We have a tendency, engrained into us since childhood, to eat everything on our plates. This happens whether it is a lot of food, or a little food. If we overfill our plates, we have a tendency to keep eating until we are finished, whether we are full or not. If we deliberately under-fill our plates instead, then we remove this temptation, and force ourselves to question whether we are still hungry before reaching for more food.Unfortunately, the longevity advantage of Okinawans is quickly disappearing. After World War II, the beloved sweet potato started to be replaced with white bread and white rice. Younger Okinawans are now eating more American-style fast food than ever, and many have become overweight. Intake of meat intake increased and intake of green and yellow vegetables decreased. In fact, the obesity rate in the prefecture has become the highest in all of Japan. It is likely that the traditional Okinawan diet has played far more of a role in their long lives than anything in their lifestyle and environment.So let\u2019s see how Okinawa stacks up in terms of our longevity secrets.The unBlue Zone \u2014 The Southern DietIn contrast to the healthy \u2018Blue Zones\u2019, certain diets in parts of the world are associated with increased risk of heart disease and decreased longevity. It is just as useful to look at these diets to learn what notto do. The best studied example comes from the southeastern area of the United States. The Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study followed over 17,000 adult participants over 5 years, looking at various dietary patterns, including a so-called \u2018Southern diet\u2019. The Southern pattern of eating was high in fried foods and added fats (mostly vegetable oils), eggs, organ meats, processed meats and sugar-sweetened beverages. Where most diet patterns studied were neutral on cardiovascular health, the Southern diet stood out as especially harmful to human health with a huge 56% increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease, 50% increase in kidney disease and 30% increase in stroke. There was more obesity, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes in this group too.The Southern diet was not particularly high in calories averaging about 1500 calories per day. Neither was the macronutrient composition particularly different from the others with about 50% carbohydrates and 35% fat, emphasizing once again that we must look at specific foods for their effect, and not general categories of macronutrients.The total amount of red meat in the Southern diet was not particularly high, but the amounts of processed meats were much off the charts. There is a huge difference between a rib-eye steak and a hot dog. The processing of meat allows the introduction of numerous chemicals and other additives (sugar, sweeteners, nitrates, phosphates, etc.) that may adversely impact health. In addition, the Southern dietary pattern contained large amounts of bread.The Southern Diet is an example of a diet that does not promote longevity. There is no calorie restriction or fasting, but the high sugar intake means that insulin levels are high leading to the excessive obesity rates common in the southeast United States. Indeed, the three most obese states in the United States in 2014 were Mississippi, West Virginia and Louisiana.The relatively high American meat consumption means that mTOR is kept high. Instead of eating natural fats, there is a very high consumption of added fats, almost all of which are vegetable oils. Fried foods are commonly cooked in industrial seed oils due to their low cost and easy availability.Longevity Checklist:The Longevity Solution, which discusses the nutritional aspects of healthy aging will be released Feb 26, 2019.Written byWritten by","10845":"There\u2019s a new movement in the world, and it\u2019s amazingly widespread. From beaches in Australia to coffee shops in Paris, from Silicon Valley in the US to the streets of Barcelona, people are hopping on a swathe of health trends that fall under one, all-encompassing label.I\u2019m talking, of course, about wellness.Wellness is something of an amorphous term. If you check Wikipedia, it\u2019s \u201can umbrella term for pseudoscientific health interventions\u201d. If you read wellness articles, that includes activities from yoga to bulletproof coffee and almost everything in between. Want to market your new infrared sauna? Call it a wellness spa and suddenly it\u2019s all the rage.The problem is that, despite offering to take you to a state of health that was previously unknown to humanity, most wellness services suffer from the same underlying issue.You see, wellness is almost entirely a scam for rich people.The World Health Organization famously defines health as \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d. It\u2019s a very good definition \u2014 being healthy is not just about disease or injury, it\u2019s about innumerable separate parts of our lives that have to work together for us to enjoy our existence.The problem is, what happens if you are already at the very top end of the WHO\u2019s definition? If you live in a wealthy suburb of a wealthy state in one of the wealthiest countries in the world? No one is 100% \u2018healthy\u2019, perhaps, but if you have access to fresh food and water, and are vaccinated against infectious diseases, you\u2019re already better off than a significant chunk of humanity.Which brings us to wellness.Wellness defines the murky divide between \u2018health\u2019 and something even better. You might feel well, but your maybe you could feel fantastic! Just take these liver supplements, spend a few hours a week mindfully doing yoga, and stare at the sun*.Wellness was demonstrated amazingly well in a recent Times article that went viral. It was a wonderful example of what happens when people who are both very wealthy and interested in their own wellbeing go down rabbit holes in search of the perfect life. The absurd nonsense that was described by the wellness experts in the article was, in many ways, the logical endpoint of a search for ultimate wellbeing that ignores the scientific realities when it comes to health.Much of this is down to the underlying ideas that the wellness movement is based on. It\u2019s usually predicated on two basic assumptions:Sadly, both of these ideas are fundamentally flawed.The first issue with wellness is that it medicalizes everyday life. There is no problem, big or small, that can\u2019t be solved with some sort of supplement or strange device. If you are already mostly healthy, this often involves creating issues where none exist. You may think you\u2019re doing ok, but what about all of the toxins in your environment? They aren\u2019t well defined, and probably don\u2019t exist, but somewhere there are large teams of people who will happily sell you expensive treatments designed to combat them.The second problem with wellness is that it totally ignores how health works for most people. Much of our wellbeing is down to factors beyond individual control. For example, take diabetes. Whether you have diabetes is not down to some vague notions of toxins but does have a lot to do with where you were born, what your parents did, and how wealthy you were growing up.Unfortunately, there is no supplement that will cure poverty.And this is a really important point. Wellness is defined by the idea the you can improve your health, that it\u2019s your responsibility to, say, drink the right kind of coconut water. If you don\u2019t shop around, it\u2019s then your fault that you are sick. This attitude doesn\u2019t just inappropriately blame people for their own ill health, it\u2019s actively ignorant of the science. If you\u2019re lucky enough to be fit, young, and generally healthy, it\u2019s usually more down to luck than some miracle of willpower.For the vast majority of people, being well is more about where they live than how much of their food is organic. If you\u2019re wealthy enough to buy boutique supplements and your own infra-red sauna, you almost certainly don\u2019t need them anyway.It\u2019s impossible to rule out that some wellness trends are helpful to health, but personally I have\u2019t seen one yet. Most of them are based on vague approximations of science and promise things that not only can they not deliver, but you don\u2019t really need anyway. For example, if you\u2019re not being admitted to a hospital, chances are most of your organs are doing a decent job already.Don\u2019t worry too much about being well. If you are mostly healthy, consider yourself lucky and do something more useful with your time. Donate some of the money that you were going to waste on your next detox retreat. And before you try any treatment, it\u2019s a good idea to check in with a doctor to see if there are downsides that you might not know about.It may not always be easy, but it\u2019s far more useful than wellness.If you enjoyed, follow me on Medium, Twitter or Facebook!*Note: don\u2019t stare at the sun, this is truly ridiculous and very dangerous it won\u2019t help your health and can make you blindWritten byWritten by","10849":"As a shy, introverted person, I find it hard to do things sometimes. Easy things, which other people seem to have no trouble with.Striking up a conversation with random strangers.Going to lift weights at the gym.Self publishing or self promoting at all.A lot of times, I face the prospect and decide, no, I couldn\u2019t possibly. I can\u2019t put myself out there.Research suggests I\u2019m not alone \u2014 nearly half of us adults here report being shy. And I\u2019m gonna be honest \u2014 it\u2019s holding us back.Why do we hesitate?Because we\u2019re afraid. Afraid of the fallout, afraid of what people will think of us, afraid that we\u2019ll do it wrong and look stupid.It\u2019s intuitive. As a species, we\u2019re typically risk-averse.That means way back when, if we resisted new types of food, or stayed hidden instead of confronting the predator, or didn\u2019t try to jump out of trees, we stayed alive.But it\u2019s 2019. We\u2019re not facing life-or-death situations, we\u2019re literally just trying to drag our dang selves to the gym to learn deadlifts, or make a new friend, or any other random small thing which might make our lives better if we weren\u2019t so afraid.How can we start trying new things? How can we convince ourselves that there\u2019s no danger, only opportunity, waiting around that scary corner?We hesitate because we\u2019re filled with doubt. Sometimes that\u2019s a good thing, and stops us making fools of ourselves. Sometimes it\u2019s the biggest obstacle in our way.When you\u2019re a perfectionist, it can be hard to start for fear of never being able to achieve the flawless result you want. Therapists recommend using something called \u201cHypothesis Testing.\u201d It means you face your worst fears.What\u2019s the worst that can happen if you show up two minutes late to a meeting? Find out.What\u2019s the worst that can happen if you submit that report without giving it a tenth proofread? Find out.This works because it\u2019s only a teeny tiny step. It\u2019s a way to get your toes wet in the world of imperfection without suffering the full consequences. You can try a scary thing and see what happens. Probably, the world doesn\u2019t collapse and you\u2019re able to carry on living, with a little more free time, or a little less stress.And it works for other things, too.Yesterday evening, I\u2019d read about this volunteer group which jogs to a nearby outdoor site, performs a volunteer act like creating a path in a park, or building a wetland habitat, and then jogs back.I desperately wanted to go \u2014 it ticked off both self-improvement goals of exercise and community involvement \u2014 but I was terrified.I stared at my computer screen for a quarter of an hour, just thinking of ways it could go wrong for me.What if it was full of professional runners?What if I was too weak to lift a shovel?What if everyone already had friends and nobody would talk to me?I thought about the principle of perfectionism I\u2019d read about and thought, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna do it.\u201d For twenty mad seconds I filled myself with courage and bravery and told myself it was just going to be one evening, and if it sucked nobody had to know about it.I hit \u201cattending\u201d on the online event.The worst possible case scenario was that I\u2019d hate it and never go again. All I would have lost would be one evening, probably sitting at home watching TV. When I thought about it that way, it wasn\u2019t so bad.And when the time came, I dragged myself into my running clothes and went out there.You can do this with any skill, any event, any stranger.Too afraid to make new friends? Tell yourself that just for half a minute, you\u2019re going to speak to that person at the bus stop.What\u2019s the worst that can happen? And isn\u2019t the best-case scenario worth the risk?You\u2019re the only thing holding yourself back, and you\u2019re the only thing that can propel yourself forward. You don\u2019t have to change your entire personality \u2014 just be brave for twenty seconds and watch as you can achieve things you\u2019d never dreamed of trying before.Written byWritten by","10896":"Everyone should be doing it!Drinking a warm glass of lemon water first thing in the morning is one of the easiest ways to improve your overall health. This must be done before you ingest any other liquid or food.Just squeeze one half of a fresh, organic lemon into a glass of warm, pure water. The water cannot be overly hot or ice cold. From an Ayurvedic perspective, warm liquids and foods fire up the digestive system when they hit the tongue. Cold items stop digestion dead in its tracks. Therefore, make sure that the water is warm. It gets your digestive system ready to tackle any oncoming food and liquids.Does drinking lemon water burn fat? Yes, it can. First of all, lemon water improves the overall process of digestion. Lemon juices are similar to, and mimic, the digestive fluids in your saliva and stomach. Lemon water also signals the liver to start producing bile, enhancing digestion even further. Lemon water can help ignite toxin-fighting within the body.Lemon juice helps balance the pH levels in the stomach and can possibly reduce indigestion and stomach\/digestive tract aches throughout the day. Once processed in the body, lemon juice is alkaline. The citric acid of the lemons does not produce acidity once it is completely metabolized by our digestive system. The citric acid alkalizes in the bloodstream and then balances the overall pH levels.We take in a lot of sugars and grains in our diets causing levels of high acidity. This can easily cause upset stomachs if not ingested in limited amounts. Having high acidity includes the entire body rather than just the stomach, as stated earlier. Eating foods high in sugars and grains can lead to arthritis\/inflammation for many people due to high pH levels within the joints. Balancing the pH levels also means balancing the uric acid in the joints ultimately relieving inflammation, and also reducing pain in joints such as arthritis and tendonitis. Arthritis and tendonitis sufferers should avoid foods high in sugar and ingest more citrus fruits. Drinking lemon water in the morning can gradually ease the pain felt from joint inflammation and arthritis. Finally, the lemon juices in the water boost energy and can improve one's mood, due to the positive reactions produced as everything is processed through the stomach.Give it a try! Embrace drinking lemon water for the next few weeks and you will begin to notice an improvement in your digestion, fat-burning, but also in your entire body and spirit. Reducing the acidity in your body can help provide more energy throughout the entire day, along with reducing occasional aches and pains due to inflammation.To recap, here are 7 benefits of drinking warm lemon water first thing in the morning:Here\u2019s to your well-being. \u2764Learn more about my Creating Peace Within course\u2026an 8-week integrative mindfulness and meditation course to help reduce anxiety, stress, and fear.You may also enjoy this article:Listen to the Love Wide Open with Heidi Dellaire Podcast.You can also find me on LWO Facebook, Heidi Dellaire Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and HeidiDellaire.com\u00a9Love Wide OpenOriginally published at lovewideopen.com on January 20, 2019.Written byWritten by","10946":"Leaving the workplace is hugely beneficial for your mind, body and most interestingly, your productivity. Of course, it makes sense. We get evenings, weekends and holidays off to ensure we\u2019re well-rested and refreshed. But even microbreaks have benefits.It\u2019s hard to avoid work when we eat at our desk \u2014 the next task is always just one email away. A coworker could come ask for your opinion on something irrelevant. Your boss could pull you in for a quick, five-minute checkup meeting. A client could email you a question that only takes a minute to reply to.Before you know it, you\u2019ve finished your sandwich, your half-hour break, and it\u2019s time to get back to work.But you never really left.Here are three positive, backed-by-science reasons you should leave your desk for lunch.By changing your environment, you\u2019re essentially telling your brain to gear up for a new set of stimuli and challenges. Leave the office, even to go sit in the meeting room, or ideally go outside.Our brains love novelty: any new experience wakes it up. A new environment stretches the parts of your brain that might have been dormant all morning.When your brain encounters something new, it actually releases dopamine \u2014 you know, that feel-good drug that makes you happy. Dopamine is more than that, though. Researchers are finding out it\u2019s closely tied to motivation: it charges you to go out and seek a reward.In this case, it means getting back to the office to storm through your to-do list in record time.Breaks help sustain concentration. Although many people advocate working for long stretches of uninterrupted time, there\u2019s a lot of research out there that points us to working for short, intense stretches with breaks in between.For example, consider the Pomodoro technique which suggests working for 25 minutes and taking a break for 5.Regularly scheduled breaks help your brain switch off as well as increasing time awareness. This helps you pick right back up where you left off, ready to go again.I talked earlier about how a change in environment can help activate your brain. Exercise works similarly. Going on a walk activates parts of your brain which were dormant while you stared at your computer all morning, giving you more stimuli to break out of ruts.Additionally, moving your body around releases neurotransmitters. These chemicals make you feel good, decrease stress, and regulate your mood. All of these side-effects are amazing for productivity at work.While this effect is more commonly known as the \u201cRunner\u2019s High\u201d, you don\u2019t need to run to get these benefits (or even break a sweat). Research at the University of Georgia found no difference in mood between low-intensity exercisers and moderate-intensity ones \u2014 which means no matter whether it\u2019s a walk or a sprint, you\u2019re getting those good endorphins.Personally, I take my full half-hour lunch break every day outside the office. If I\u2019ve brought food I can\u2019t take with me (like soup), I eat while I work and take my break after.I\u2019ve found my primary result is that I\u2019m less annoyed with my coworkers who continually think it\u2019s OK to interrupt me when I\u2019m clearly eating my sandwich and scrolling through Twitter.If I\u2019m not in the office, they can\u2019t bother me.Always a plus in my book.I\u2019m much more energized and motivated to work when I get back. Many times when I\u2019ve been stumped on a problem, I find I\u2019ve got a new idea to tackle the issue.I\u2019m more productive in the morning because I know I\u2019ll be out for half an hour at lunch, and need to finish my work. I know I\u2019m going to be out for that half hour, so if I want to finish anything off, I have to tie off loose ends before lunch.Ultimately? It\u2019s just nice to not stare at a screen for a small part of my day. Whether you want to be more productive at work, accomplish more with your time, or spark a new thought, stepping away from your desk is the best thing you can do with your lunch break.Written byWritten by","10987":"Spending time alone can be one of the best things you can do for yourself. But a lot of us \u2014 myself included \u2014 suck at being alone. If you\u2019re like me, you prefer spending time with other people. You like to share, whether it\u2019s food, movies, or adventures.But it\u2019s nearly impossible to get rid of the background chatter that\u2019s constantly going on in our lives without choosing to take some alone time. What\u2019s more, due to our instant connectivity to the outside world with our phones, we often feel like we can\u2019t \u201cswitch off,\u201d as we should always be doing something productive.Being alone sparks creativity, it builds independence, and it can help you decrease your stress and anxiety levels \u2014 as long as you do it right.It\u2019s important to note that being alone and feeling alone are two very different concepts. Loneliness has a massively negative effect on our psyche and our physical health.We\u2019re social creatures, at the end of the day, and our lives are built around our connections with others.That being said, spending time alone is paramount to self-development. Here\u2019s how you can spend some quality one-on-one time getting to know the most important person in your life \u2014 yourself.The first thing you need to do is pick where you\u2019re going to be alone. Are you going to be at your desk? On a walk? Swimming? Just sitting at your table with a cup of tea?Choose your setting wisely as it will affect the outcome of your alone time. For myself, I prefer to do something physical during my solitude. I find that as my body is kept busy, my mind is free to roam and relax.For example, when I swim on my own, the exercise is hard. I come out of it panting from the strenuous workout. But I feel refreshed, content, and peaceful after having spent an hour or so letting my mind drift, thinking about nothing in particular.One of the most important steps to using alone time effectively is to let go of the tether that keeps you connected to other people.If you want to truly use alone time to its greatest benefit, you have to actually be alone. And in this day and age, that means no phone.A phone is a constant source of distraction. Social media has been developed around the idea that our attention is currency that we\u2019re paying it without even realizing.If you\u2019re worried about keeping time, bring a watch. If you want to jot down any interesting ideas, bring a notebook. There are lots of ways to get a lot out of your alone time by relying on analog alternatives to our phone.Being alone is best when it\u2019s 100% voluntary and there are boundaries around it. Determine how long you\u2019re going to spend alone, what you want to achieve, and the purpose of your solitude.Decide beforehand what you\u2019re doing this for. Do you want to just relax? Do you prefer to generate some ideas? Are you getting some peace after a busy day?Use that to help you draw some limits on your time. For example, if I\u2019m wanting to truly disconnect and recharge, I\u2019ll go on a 90 minute walk. If I just want to spark my creativity and think of some great article ideas, I\u2019ll sit down for half an hour.One of the primary benefits of being alone is that when we disconnect, we\u2019re most receptive to new ideas. But in order for that to happen, we can\u2019t be distracted.So if your motivation for alone time is to come up with a new story idea, to work on your songs, or eve just be open to fresh thoughts and ideas, you have to actively choose not to be distracted.That means no podcasts, no book, no music, no phone calls. Just spend the time thinking without distraction.You might worry you\u2019ll get bored \u2014 but you\u2019ll find that as you consciously spend more time alone, you become better at keeping yourself entertained.Every time you\u2019re alone and you have an impulse to check your email, update your social media, look at the news, read your book, redirect it to internal reflection instead.It\u2019s like meditation. You might not be good to start out, but with conscious practice, this is a skill you can improve. And there\u2019s a whole world of benefit for you if you do.Honestly, it can seem scary to spend time alone, without any kind of safety rope like a book or a phone to keep us tethered to the world of other people.But when we practice being alone, we give ourselves time to disconnect form the outside world and all its stimuli, refreshing us and letting us assimilate new information.The outcome is a fresh mind, new ideas, and creativity, and the ability to understand that time spent not doing anything is not time wasted.Want a four-day email course on how to start making money on Medium?

It takes time. For example, the average time bipolar 2 can go undiagnosed is six years. For me, it was ten. Following diagnosis, the process of pursuing the best path for treatment begins.I didn\u2019t really know how to go about finding it. Someone suggested a neuropsychologist, and I went to him. I never expected to feel comfortable in therapy; I hate talking about difficult subjects and delving into the events and emotions of my life. One doctor prescribed me medication and the neuropsychologist supplied my therapy. It wasn\u2019t working as well as I\u2019d hoped, but I didn\u2019t know any better so I kept at it\u2026unsuccessfully.It wasn\u2019t until my rock bottom in 2013 and after my husband and parents intervened more emphatically, that I gave psychotherapy another chance. Luckily, this time the doctor was right for me. Did I immediately feel comfortable speaking with this psychiatrist? No way. Five years later, I still often dread going; however, I have seen positive results. In addition, with this doctor, I\u2019ve found medication therapy that works well, too.*Which medications work?*Which side effects can you tolerate?*Do you need a combination of medications?*What dosages work best?\u2192 There is no one-size-fits-all treatment.It just makes my condition more bearable. The bad days are still quite bad, but I\u2019ve come a long way, baby!These are probably the most difficult for someone who is clinically depressed. Oftentimes, even the simplest task feels like an impossible task: sometimes, taking a shower is challenge enough. Lifestyle changes overall include diet, exercise, and daily routines.Even with all I\u2019m doing, some people don\u2019t realize just how far I\u2019ve come. I\u2019m not trying to be whiny or dramatic or attention-seeking when I discuss how I\u2019m feeling. However, recently\u2026Again, there is no \u201cfix\u201d, just attempts to manage.To top it off, therapy and meds aren\u2019t cheap. Most insurance companies don\u2019t cover any of it. $200 for a 50-minute session\u2026beginning weekly. As you make progress you can gradually stretch it out. Right now, I\u2019m every two months; however, I may need to back it up a bit again for awhile.Copyright \u00a9 2019 Alicia T-Rust.

In addition to routine, run-of-the-mill appointments with dentists and doctors, I\u2019ve also had a handful of slightly more serious procedures.And a thing that runs consistent across all of these is:Why are these people touching me so much??I don\u2019t mean necessary touching. Of course the dentist will touch my mouth, my teeth, my gums \u2014 duh. Maybe even the occasional, accidental face or shoulder brush \u2014 okay. The eye doctor presses devices against my face \u2014 fine. I\u2019ve seen doctors for a knee injury and a shoulder injury \u2014 in both cases, I fully expect them to touch and even manipulate these areas \u2014 no problem.My issue is with: the inexplicable \u201ceverything else.\u201dIt\u2019s \u201cthe casual arm touch\u201d \u2014 especially when it lingers. The \u201cgentle shoulder grab.\u201d The hand squeeze. The elbow grasp. The thigh pat (which\u2026 WHAT. IN. THE. ACTUAL. HELL???!) And it\u2019s definitely the \u201cpassive resting of their lower body against ours when we\u2019re on a table\u201d (because yo dawg\u2026 WHAT?)Stop touching us.I recently went in for shoulder surgery.It was a fairly common and straightforward procedure; probably something they do everyday \u2014 like my own team\u2019s status reports or morning stand-ups.But for me, it was something I\u2019d prefer to experience only once in my lifetime (and really, ideally, not even that, but here we are) and, incidentally, it was something that scared me. Which is why I put it off for like five years, \u201cwaiting it out\u201d while the issue ever-so-slowly got worse.\u201cI\u2019m nervous,\u201d I told the doctor straightforwardlyHe laughed and said, \u201cI know. I can tell.\u201dI laid face down on the vinyl\/foam medical table, silently reciting all the logical reasons I wouldn\u2019t die, like Hail Mary\u2019s along a rosary, as he shot me up with local anesthesia, slathered me with the orange-red betadine I\u2019d seen used in the gruesome gastric bypass hack-scenes on \u201cMy 600-lb Life,\u201d then delicately draped me in towels, presumably to make disposing my body easier.I was already sweating through the paper sheet beneath me before he\u2019d even whipped out his scalpel.I spent every moment during the procedure willing myself not to think about what was happening behind my head, but it was so close to my ear I could hear every slicing, snipping sound, like scissors cutting through textured fabric or Doc making painstaking paper snowflakes. I was, in a word, uncomfortable. And drenched in sweat. I imagined being anywhere but there.And halfway through my procedure, in waltzes \u201cMary.\u201dNow my doctor, to his credit, mentioned that Mary might be joining us, so her doing so was not a surprise to me \u2014 that part was fine. But my assumption in this regard (that is, Mary) was that she was there for him\u2026 or hell, even herself \u2014and not for me. But Mary didn\u2019t quite seem to share that expectation.A few moments after her arrival, she grabbed my \u201cgood\u201d arm\u2019s elbow and Grandma\u2019d at me in a sickly-sweet-shout: \u201cYOU DOING OKAY???\u201dStartled and shaken from my \u201csafe place\u201d inside my head, I mumbled, \u201cuh, yeah.\u201dBut rather than accepting this for what it was, Mary let her hand linger on my person a moment longer, then gave it a squeeze, and a pat, before removing it.I thought that would be the end of it.I thought wrong.Because no, that Mary, she had work ethic. Real tenacious gal, that one. So Mary, she did this 3 or 4 or 18 more times throughout the procedure.Her: *touch* \u201cYOU STILL DOING OKAY??\u201dMe, out loud: \u201cyehhhhp!\u201dMe, in my head: \u201cOMFG LITERALLY STOP!!\u201dHer: *squeeze* *pat* *pat* *rub* *pat* *pat*Me: *dies inside*What made it even worse was: I never actually met Mary. All I knew was her name, the pattern of her silly scrubs, and how her morning commute in had been (\u201cokay,\u201d by her account.)That, and her clammy hand and sing-song Poppins voice, knocking me around.And I know it begs the question:Why don\u2019t you just say something??!Yeah, I get it. I realize.To be honest: I don\u2019t know.Between sweating through the sheets and tying to remember to keep breathing \u2014 but also not hyperventilate (a tough balance when both are just a labored breath away)\u2014I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to make it uncomfortable for everyone else \u2014 especially with \u201cHouse\u201d back there digging around in my flesh with scalpels and scissors and pliers and forceps and chainsaws. And even more to this point: I didn\u2019t trust myself not to snap.So, call me helpless, but I hunkered down and just tried to slip away into my breathing, pretending I was somewhere else where my body wasn\u2019t flayed open in front of three strangers (another nurse was there from the start); somewhere peaceful and far away\u2026 only to be periodically dragged back by my left arm.\u201cYOU OKAY??!\u201d *squeeze* *squeeze*Damn, lady. Just kill me now. The scalpel\u2019s right there.Afterwards, when I\u2019d made it out alive with only 1,000 stitches and a huge dressing, Mary followed me not just to the front desk but all the way outside like some middle school dance stage-5 clinger hanger-on.Me, out loud: \u201cwelp, thanks again. my ride is just around the corner.\u201dMe, in my head: omg Mary go awayMary: \u201coh. good.\u201d (pause) \u201clovely day, isn\u2019t it?!\u201dMe: \u201csure is \u2014 have a good one, Mary.\u201dAnd then she reached out again, pawing toward me for one last touch.I turned away from her with a pained smile, desperate for my getaway car.This isn\u2019t the first time this has happened.On the contrary, I\u2019ve been touched a lot by medical professions. (As I\u2019m sure many others have as well.)I\u2019ve had eye doctors rest their arms on my thighs; I\u2019ve had gynecologist technicians pat and squeeze them. I\u2019ve been touched and grasped and patted and rubbed and grabbed by a huge variety of medical professions. If I were playing \u201csuperfluous touch by a nurse or doctor or medical intern or tech or, hell, medical office front desk receptionist\u201d Bingo, I\u2019d have won enough $10 Olive Garden gift cards to eat there for a month by now.Seems it\u2019s more the norm than the exception. And this, this was just the most recent event.And all of them leave me wondering\u2026 but y tho?And? Please stop.duh.We don\u2019t need to belabor this point. I think we can all agree: touching the patient in the area having treatment is logical. But touching them anywhere else \u2014 on the hand, arm, shoulder, or thigh, or, god forbid, leaning your body against theirs \u2014 is not a part of the treatment.Imagine a police officer squeezing your shoulder as you dig for your license and registration. Or a judge patting your thigh. Or a flight attendant. A post office employee. A teller. A bus driver. A professor on the first day of class. A grocery store clerk. A mechanic. Whatever.Folks are quick to point out that these aren\u2019t \u201chealthcare professionals.\u201d And yes\u2026 that is correct.But a.) healthcare professionals are not entitled to all aspects of touch. And b.) alternative health professionals, such as massage therapists and yoga instructors, have somehow figured out how to do their job without man-handling their patients \/ assuming it\u2019s \u201cpart of their job.\u201d So\u2026?This touching is not part of the deal.I have to imagine \u2014 need to imagine \u2014 that some people do find superfluous touches from medical professionals to be \u201ccalming.\u201dAnd so my best guess \u2014 my benefit of the doubt \u2014 is that medical professionals, in turn, think it\u2019s \u201ccalming\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d for everyone. (This is my most complimentary assumption, however, as I\u2019m also fully aware that they may be \u2014 and likely often are \u2014 simply doing it for themselves, either to satisfy their own interests, or because they like when others do it to them.)The problem is that it isn\u2019t liked by everyone. It is, in fact, disliked by a great many.Which makes this presumptuous and oblivious at best. And invasive at worst.And despite pure and positive intents, touching often has exactly the opposite effect. It often makes already-nervous patients even more nervous.Patients, of course, implicitly consent to being touched in the area of focus. This makes sense. But that does not mean the medical profession is entitled to touch us wherever the hell they want.Other professions respect this\u2026Hair stylists don\u2019t touch your teeth; dentists don\u2019t play with your hair. Shoe stores, coat stores, makeup counters \u2014 even when these people are touching us, everyone somehow manages to stay in their lane.Massage therapists usually ask if there\u2019s any area you don\u2019t want touched.Yoga instructors will ask for raised hands to indicate which individuals are okay with \u201cadjustments.\u201d Or hand out cards for class participants to display. Or just ask before they do so. It\u2019s not rocket science.I certainly intend to if Mary gets handsy again at my follow-up appointment in a few weeks \u2014 when scalpels will be a safe distance from my body.Written byWritten by","11117":"This past winter break, after a rather stressful semester of teaching coupled with wedding planning, I was more than ready for the ensuing honeymoon on the beach in Mexico. I knew the trip would be a necessary opportunity to finally unplug and unwind. One of my favorite ways to do this is through reading, so I went to Barnes and Noble the night before our departure to find any book that looked interesting to take with me to Mexico.I found a book called The Finnish Way: Finding Courage, Wellness and Happiness Through the Power of Sisu. The title caught my attention with its reference to a faraway culture and language (I\u2019m a language teacher a.k.a travel fanatic). I thumbed through the pages to get a sense of whether I would like the book or not and after a quick glance figured \u201cWhy not?\u201d and bought it.It proved to be the perfect accompaniment to my vacation as I sipped pi\u00f1a coladas by the pool. The book\u2019s sole focus is to explain \u201csisu\u201d (pronounced \u201csee-su\u201d) \u2014 a sort of Finnish cultural phenomenon that the author contends is the reason behind the high level of happiness among the Finns. As it turns out, \u201csisu\u201d is the Finnish word for what in English might be described as courage mixed with grit. It\u2019s a cultural teaching that Finns instill in their children from a young age so that by the time they are adults, they have a certain will to persevere and an unrelenting positivity in the face of challenges. As author Katja Pantzar points out:\u201cSisu is a way of life to actively transform the challenges that come our way into opportunities.\u201dIt\u2019s simply a natural underpinning of the Finns\u2019 daily lifestyle \u2014 and offers huge benefits.Back in that moment in time, there by the pool, the author\u2019s teachings struck a chord with me. Despite having just gotten married to the man of my dreams surrounded by our closest loved ones, I was still dealing with plenty of other life stressors. In fact, the book helped me realize that this is a natural part of the American lifestyle \u2014 we overwork ourselves and deprive ourselves of vacations because inherent in our culture is a persistent will to achieve success. Maybe it could do some good to adopt \u201cthe Finnish Way\u201d?So that\u2019s what I did. I took the author\u2019s advice and tried out some Finnish behaviors and, I have to say, it made a huge difference in my life. So maybe you\u2019d like to try these for yourself:So, despite the extreme cold and darkness that Finns endure in winter, they cultivate and demonstrate their \u201csisu\u201d every day and this helps them maintain high levels of happiness. I like how Katja Pantzar puts it in her book:\u201cInstead of \u2018I can\u2019t\u2019 or \u2018I won\u2019t\u2019, how about \u2018How can I?\u2019\u201dApplying the principles of The Finnish Way to my life has had a dramatic improvement on my mood and mindset. In fact, my husband and I now joke with one another when we\u2019re about to complain or create an excuse for not doing something: we say \u201csisu\u201d and get on with it.So, cheers to finding your inner \u201csisu.\u201d : )Written byWritten by","11145":"Don\u2019t ruin your marriage because of nasty skid-marks\u2026Question:My husband and I have been married for four years and are still very much in love. He has many amazing qualities and I still think he\u2019s hot.We both have our own businesses so our lives are VERY busy.Even though we\u2019re super busy, we still make time for each other as often as possible.We have a rule in our house, where we never work on our businesses after 9pm on a weekday, and 6pm on the weekend.We make sure we have sex a few times per week.But, and this is a HUGE BUT, we have a problem about personal hygiene.Not mine. But my husband\u2019s hygiene. Or lack thereof\u2026I first met my husband when we were in college, he was the guy every girl wanted.He was extremely popular, and I knew a ton of girls who wanted a date with him.He always looked well groomed. Even if he let his stubble grow, he still looked like he\u2019d just come from a modelling shoot\u2026After we started dating, I noticed he always smelled a million dollars.When I first visited his house, I saw he had the biggest collection of after-shaves I\u2019d ever seen.Must have cost a small fortune\u2026He never had bad breath. He always carried a packet of mints\u2026His clothes were always clean\u2026He never had body odour\u2026After we married he was the same for the best part\u2026I\u2019m not sure when things changed.But I started noticing that he\u2019d \u201cforget\u201d to brush his teeth in the morning.Then I noticed he\u2019d not put on any deodorant.It got so bad that his boss called me to tell me his poor body odour was upsetting people in his office.How embarrassing?When I confronted him, he\u2019d just say his life is too busy!When we were at my sister\u2019s house last week, one of my nephews said he \u2018was smelly\u2019\u2026I was so embarrassed!But the biggest embarrassment has to be his underwear.It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t wipe his bottom at all.I know toilet paper doesn\u2019t get anyone totally clean.But his skid-stains are unreal!I guess we all get skid-marks sometimes. But my husband\u2019s are mega embarrassing.It\u2019s got so bad that I have to do an extra load of washing just for his underwear!I mean, I don\u2019t want to wash my blouses all mixed up with his disgusting underwear. Yuk!It\u2019s got so bad that I have to remind him about his poor hygiene on a daily basis.He smells on a daily basis.His only response when I tell him is, \u201cI don\u2019t want to argue\u201d\u2026Whenever I see him getting dressed in the morning I have to remind him to wear deodorant.His response? \u201cI don\u2019t sweat at work\u201d\u2026I believe everyone must have a general level of hygiene out of respect for others around us.I would love my husband to use deodorant every day.I want him to brush his hair every morning.And brush his teeth every morning and night.I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable.I don\u2019t want to nag him like his mother used to. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what drove them apart.But having to remind him every day is doing my head in.And it\u2019s driving a wedge between us.I never thought dirty skid-marked underpants would ever be the reason for divorce, but I just can\u2019t handle it anymore.I don\u2019t know how I can get the husband I first fell in love with to come back.Of course, I still love him.But his poor hygiene is REALLY embarrassing.And I feel like I can\u2019t handle it anymore.I just don\u2019t understand how he could change so much.He used to take such great care of himself.I can\u2019t think what changed him.Do you think there is anything I can do to motivate him to look after himself?I don\u2019t want his poor hygiene to lead to divorce, but I really do feel I\u2019ve had enoughWhat can I do?Dear Abby\u2019s Answer:Every culture has certain expectations for personal hygiene. A refusal to meet the minimum standard in a culture is typically found in individuals with personality or mental health issues.Your husband is in complete spiral. His poor hygiene is clearly damaging your relationship. And it looks like his job is even in danger. No one wants to work with a smelly guy.Your marriage is clearly in trouble.I know you don\u2019t want to be the controlling mother-type.But this battle is definitely about his poor personal hygiene. This is not a battle about your relationship.If you fix his poor hygiene habits, you\u2019ll save your marriage.And it looks like you could save his job.If your husband has stopped showering before work, there could be clear signals something is seriously suffocating him.But it sounds like your husband is in complete denial.When he pretends he forgets to brush his teeth or put on deodorant, this is pure poppycock.Never kiss him if his breath stinks. And tell him why.Buy a bum gun sprayer for your bathroom and stop buying toilet paper.Show him how to spray, and he\u2019ll soon catch on.Get ready for work together, and put deodorant on together.Brush your teeth together, sharing the toothpaste tube as you do.Reward him with a sweet kiss after brushing.Cuddle him.Compliment him on how fresh and handsome he is.You\u2019ll soon have the clean man you first fell in love with back if you make your hygiene routine a joint exercise.Happy Spraying and Good luck, Abby xxWritten byWritten by","11161":"Sometimes there\u2019s a choice, and sometimes, there isn\u2019t. This time. I had to make the call.It was after dinner, and I was trying to get up from the table.I\u2019d been having muscle soreness since the night before, the deep skeletal ache across my body that makes it hard to pull myself up, to type, to move, to walk. But it was mild.At first, I thought it was a natural soreness that comes with trying to walk more. But, by that afternoon, I had the feeling that it was the soreness that I\u2019d had only a couple of times before. It was taking me a lot of extra effort to get up \u2014 strategic positioning so that I could brace myself against firm surfaces.If you\u2019re a skinny person, you might not believe that someone as fat as me can get up and down pretty easily. Much the same as you, really. A little bit slower, a little bit less graceful, but it\u2019s not usually a problem at all. Unless I\u2019m sitting in something weird, like one of those canvas camping chairs. That requires a little bit of strategy. Or, else,I pretty much roll out to a kneeling position on the ground, and get myself up from the ground.I digress, but, like I said, getting up usually isn\u2019t a problem. It was like my muscles didn\u2019t work.Fortunately (or not) I\u2019d experienced this once before. Summer, a couple of years ago. 110-degree heat in the California high desert, sitting in a baking house with a box fan and ice water. Lots of ice water. My usual working space was sitting on the floor, using a coffee table. For two days, I couldn\u2019t get up. Then, I couldn\u2019t sit up.That little misadventure ended with six firefighters carrying me out of the house on a tarp-blanket thing that my Dad ended up commandeering \u2014 \u201cIf it can hold your ass, it can keep the shit in the back of my truck.\u201d (I am not so high and mighty that I didn\u2019t laugh at that.) \u2014 a 45 minute ambulance ride, my first foley catheter (yoinks!) , and a fun new vocab word: hypokalemia.Basically, there was no potassium in my body. (The low end of normal is 3.6 millimoles per liter (mmol\/L). 2.5 mmol\/L is the beginning of dangerous territory. When I was brought in then, I was down to 0.6 mmol\/L.)But, here we are. A couple of years later, on the other side of the country, and I can\u2019t get out of my chair. After about 10 minutes, including a strategic roll onto the floor, and desperately trying to find something to brace myself against, I manage to stand up.It isn\u2019t easy. And, with an audience, it\u2019s fucking embarrassing to say the least. But I\u2019m up, and now I have to make a choice. Do I go to the ER, or do I try to sleep it off?As a poor person, the answer is easy. If I\u2019m not dead, there\u2019s no reason to go to the hospital. That way lies madness, and bills for more money than I will ever be worth. In the United States\u2019s capitalist system, there\u2019s not a lot of moral algebra to do: my life is fundamentally worthless. Going to the hospital will cost more money than my life is worth. Maybe I can sleep this off.As a fat person, there\u2019s the specter of the fire fighters coming again, having to carry my fat ass in an ultra-hold tarp down two flights of stairs into an ambulance. On a busy street. We live on the main thoroughfare in a small Pennsylvania town. A small-enough town that this little scene might honestly, legitimately, be considered not only newsworthy, but hold-the-presses, A1, top fold story with a nice big photograph.(Today\u2019s top fold story was the county\u2019s new 911 system. They\u2019re dying for something juicy.)So I get in the car, and Shaunta drives to the ER.People are perfectly polite at the hospital, but there are little barbs in the politeness. I am not yet cynical enough to believe that they\u2019re intentional. People in this country don\u2019t know how to deal with fat people. They\u2019re being sold a multi-billion dollar ad campaign about how anyone who\u2019s still fat must not be buying the right products or trying the right diets.Forgive them, Father, they know not what they do. Presumably, attending nursing school doesn\u2019t leave you a lot of free time to read Your Fat Friend and Roxane Gay. It\u2019s only through their words, and others\u2019s, that I have begun to deconstruct my own issues with fatness.So, I take the barbs with grace. I only seethe a little on the inside.First is the little shocked expression when the ER nurses ask my weight.\u201c510.\u201d I answer truthfully, as best I can. That number\u2019s a few months old, but it\u2019s close enough to true. Not like my old California driver\u2019s license, where I still clung to 350. Oh, my sweet summer child.The older nurse has a good poker face. The younger one manages to smooth away their shocked expression quickly. There\u2019s no comment on it, at least yet. I wait for it, and luckily, it doesn\u2019t come.In some hospitals, this isn\u2019t the case. There are sometimes questions about my mobility (which is perfectly fine, I suppose) \u2014 those\u2019ll come when I go upstairs, in this case. This time, they\u2019re perfectly polite. Sometimes, they\u2019re not.One time (at a different hospital), I had to affirm, explicitly, that I can wipe my own ass. For the record, in case you are curious, I can.I mean, it takes a whole system of levers and pulleys and a little robot dressed in a butler outfit, but I can get it done.Then there comes the dietary chat. This time, it happened when I went upstairs, and the Hospitalist came in for a quick visit.\u201cI know you\u2019re a young guy. You\u2019re only 28, and your BMI is over 70.\u201d Somewhere around 71 last time I checked, Doc.You still have your whole life ahead of you.\u201d Eh, I think most of it is in the rear view mirror, now. Depression and suicidality aside, I can\u2019t imagine living another 28 years in this meat suit. It sounds like a cruelty.\u201cHell, I\u2019m only 31. We\u2019re really close in age.\u201d God, what do people do when their doctor is younger than them? The thought of it makes me cringe. The day I have a doctor that\u2019s younger than me, I think it\u2019ll be time to permanently pack my bags for Heaven. Or Valhalla. Whatever afterlife\u2019s willing to take me in.\u201cYou really need to start making some changes.\u201d I talk about my plans, back in Reno, to get set up with a bariatric surgeon. How those plans were put on a sort of permanent hold thanks to insurance problems and the move.\u201cWell, you can always do that, but surgery doesn\u2019t always fix the problem. You\u2019ve got to look at your eating habits.\u201d Yes, my eating habits aren\u2019t the greatest. But I was a 50 pound 12-month old, long before I could develop my maladaptive relationship with food. Habits are some of the problem, absolutely. But every diet I\u2019ve ever been on has left me weight cycling. Dieting doesn\u2019t help when your fixed point is somewhere around 505 pounds.\u201cEven I overeat sometimes, too.\u201d I\u2019ve seen the entirety of ER, Grey\u2019s Anatomy, and House. I have a pretty good idea of how much junk y\u2019all eat in med school \u2014 and afterwards.\u201cI\u2019m technically overweight. I\u2019ve got to be careful, too.\u201d Maybe she technically is, but that\u2019s only a testament to how idiotic the BMI scale is. She is perfectly standard sized.She gives me the talk: when you eat meat, it should be no larger than a deck of cards. Keep your servings small. Cut back on carbs and fatty foods. I have seen this poster, this flyer, this reminder at every turn for nearly three decades. And despite internalizing the knowledge, and knowing that I should do better, it doesn\u2019t seem to matter.I stay perfectly polite. I\u2019m not here to be an asshole. I\u2019m not here to call anybody out. And most everybody is truly pleasant. One of my nurses is named Donna, and she reminds me almost instantly of Donna Moss from The West Wing in the way she talks, how sweet she is.These are good people. My fear of their judgment isn\u2019t going to get me anywhere. But I still have that fear. A person my size can\u2019t go out into the world without it. And, after hearing some of the horror stories about how fat people are treated by doctors, by medical staff, I can\u2019t be caught off my guard.It might not happen today, but if I keep splurging on medical help, it\u2019s going to happen. Inevitably. I\u2019m going to get a real, ripe, asshole. Maybe it\u2019s confirmation bias. Maybe it\u2019s just the reality of being fat in America.For now, I\u2019m in acute care. Still have an IV in my arm, feeling kind of grody and in need of a shower, and wearing a gown that reminds me of and makes me crave mint chocolate chip ice cream.I\u2019m still a little sore, but the potassium is coming up. I\u2019m getting acute care. That\u2019s what it says on the doctor\u2019s card.But, sometimes, I wish there was obtuse care. Or whatever the opposite of acute is in this context. I wish there was a way to solve the entire problem that is me. A real solution, beyond diets that yo-yo my weight around, starvation that I can\u2019t seem to hold myself to. A way to solve the problem that is me.Because somewhere in here, I have to believe that there is a person of worth. Not just one that my friends and the people who love me can see, but one that the entire world can recognize and respect. A body that can walk and run and laugh and dance and fly and celebrate.I want to have a whole life worth living, but I can\u2019t hold my breath anymore. I\u2019ll settle for the shards of what I should have had. I\u2019ll settle for what\u2019s left.Written byWritten by","11209":"The legendary Spanish conquistador Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n (1460\u20131521), like many of his contemporaries, sought fame and fortune through exploration of the New World. He settled in Hispaniola (now modern day Dominican Republic) before becoming the governor of Puerto Rico for 2 years before being replaced by Christopher Columbus\u2019 son, Diego. Forced to sail once again, he allegedly heard native tales of a mythical \u2018fountain of youth\u2019.He explored many parts of the Bahamas and is believed to have landed in 1513 near the present-day town of St. Augustine in northeast Florida. He named this newly \u2018discovered\u2019 land Florida from the Spanish word \u2018florido\u2019 meaning \u2018full of flowers\u2019. He continued his explorations throughout the Florida coast and Florida Keys, but died never having found the elusive fountain of youth.This well-known story is likely entirely fictional. Ponce de Le\u00f3n\u2019s writings contain no mention of the fountain of youth, and his vigorous explorations were for more pedestrian reasons \u2014 to find gold, lands for colonization, and to spread Christianity. But the notion of a mystical substance that can reverse aging is so powerful that the legend has endured throughout all these years. So, what exactly is aging?Everyone instinctively knows what it means to age, but science, to successfully tackle any problem, requires an accurate definition. Aging may be viewed in several different ways. First, aging manifests by changing appearances. Grey hair, wrinkled skin, or other superficial changes signal underlying age. These may reflect underlying physiologic changes, like decreased pigment production in hair follicles or the decreased elasticity of the skin. Cosmetic surgery changes appearances but not the underlying physiology. Second, aging may be viewed a loss of function. Over time, women have decreasing fertility until it ceases completely during menopause, in a process largely determined by age. Bones become weaker increasing the risk of fractures such as hip fractures, which are rarely seen in young people. Muscles becoming weaker explaining why champion athletes and bodybuilders are young. Third, at the cellular and molecular level, response to hormones decreases with age. The mitochondria, the important cellular components that produce energy and are commonly known as \u201cthe powerhouses of the cell\u201d, become less efficient and less able to produce energy. The declining efficiency of the aging body results in higher rates of illness and disease.Increasing age exponentially increases the risk for chronic disease and death. Heart attacks, for example, are virtually absent in children, but common in old age. Humans face \u201ca wall of death\u201d. Aging itself is not a disease, but increases the chances of other diseases, which makes it the best target to stop or reverse chronic diseases. Age, in chronologic years, is irreversible, but aging, in physiologic years, is not.Hippocrates, the ancient Greek father of modern medicine long ago acknowledged nutrition as the cornerstone of health and longevity. Where famine causing lack of nutrition may have been one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the modern problems of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes are just as deadly. In both cases, the foods we eat play an important part in promoting or preventing all these issues.One important damage-repair mechanism is called autophagy. The 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi for \u201chis discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy\u201d underscoring how vital this process is. In autophagy, cellular parts called \u2018organelles\u2019 are broken down and recycled periodically as part of a wide-ranging quality control system. Just as a car needs regular replacement of oil, filters and fan belts, a cell must replace its organelles regularly to maintain normal function. As cellular organelles pass their expiration dates, the body ensures that old organelles are removed and replaced with new ones, so that there is no residual damage that impedes function. One of the key discoveries of the last quarter century is that these damage control procedures are heavily influenced by the foods we eat. But why do we age at all?Evolution by natural selection works at the level of genes, not individual organisms. We all carry thousands of different genes, and pass them on to our children. Genes best suited to their environment survive better, which lets them produce more offspring. Over time, these beneficial genes become more widespread in the population. Age plays a large role in determining the effect of a gene on the population.A gene that is fatal at age 10 (before having children) will be rapidly eliminated from the population, since the person bearing that gene is unable to pass it on to children. A gene that is fatal at age 30, will still be eliminated (albeit more slowly), because people without the gene have more children. A gene fatal at age 70 may never be eliminated because the gene will have passed into the next generation long before it manifests its deadly effects.Viewed in this manner, the fight against the ravages of aging, is thus a fight against nature. Aging is completely natural, although the extent and speed is variable. Living and eating completely in tune with nature does not prevent aging. Nature and evolution do not \u2018care\u2019 about your longevity, only your gene\u2019s survival. In a sense, we must look beyond nature to slow or prevent aging.Shockingly, and almost without precedent in human history, children today may live a shorter lifespan than their parents. The 20thcentury witnessed huge steady advances in medicine and public health that have significantly increased average life expectancy. But recently an epidemic of chronic diseases threatens to slow or reverse that enviable record.Before the modern industrial era, with its advances in sanitation and medicine, infectious diseases were the main natural causes of death. In the United States in 1900, life expectancy at birth for a man was 46 years, for a woman 48 due largely due to the high infant and childhood mortality. But those who survived to maturity actually had a good chance of surviving to older age. The top 3 causes of death in 1900 were all infectious in nature \u2014 pneumonia, flu, tuberculosis, and gastrointestinal infections.These infectious diseases can affect any age although children and the elderly are especially vulnerable.Today\u2019s situation is different. The top two causes of death are cardiovascular and cancer related deaths, both diseases tightly correlated to age. Cardiovascular disease, which includes heart disease and stroke, is the #1 cause of death in the U.S. accounting for 1 in 4 deaths and its incidence increases dramatically with age. Children rarely suffer a heart attack, but by age 65, the majority of men have some form of cardiovascular disease,(age 85 for women).The story is the same for cancer. Children and young adults each account for only about 1% of new cancer cases each year. Adults aged 25 to 49 account for about another 10%, whereas people aged 50 and above account for around 89% of all new cancer cases. Other diseases clearly linked to aging include cataracts, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases, kidney disease. These diseases of aging are responsible for approximately two thirds of the roughly 150,000 people who die around the world every single day. These are diseases that affect hardly anyone under the age of 40. In the industrialized West, the proportion of people who die from aging-caused diseases approaches 90%.As modern medicine conquered or reduced many infectious diseases like small pox, one consequence of its very own success is an aging population with its inherently higher risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and diabetes. But that\u2019s not the whole story. The rise of seemingly unstoppable and unparalleled obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemic is putting our health at increasing risk of cancer and heart disease. There are many dietary and lifestyle modifications you can adopt to reverse this risk of chronic disease.Aging is the slow accumulation of cellular damage due to a decreasing ability to repair it. This results in a low-level of inflammation, so characteristic of aging it\u2019s been termed \u201cinflammaging\u201d. Oxidative stress, a condition in which free radicals overpower the body\u2019s internal antioxidant system, rises with age. But you can make lifestyle changes today that can increase the odds of healthy aging. You can increase not just your lifespan, but your \u2018healthspan\u2019. Nobody wants to spend their last years frail, sick and in a nursing home. We discuss more about the dietary determinants of aging in The Longevity Solution. The prevention of aging is about longer years of healthy life, free of disease and other drawbacks of old age, vigorous and energetic, with an enthusiasm for life and living. Longevity means extending youth, not extending old age.Written byWritten by","11226":"It was a gloriously golden, warm September afternoon and I was crumpled up in the fetal position on my bedroom floor, ugly crying. I had nothing left in me. I was a twenty three years old, newly married, employed, financially alright, plant-based vegetarian, and for the six hundredth day in a row, I felt horrible.I was supposed to be packing for a leisurely weekend camping trip but I could not muster up a shred of mental, physical or emotional energy to pack or prepare. In frantic texts to my new husband, I described myself as \u201cdrained,\u201d \u201czapped,\u201d \u201cdried up.\u201dSomewhere in my exhausted tears there was frustration. This should not be happening to me. I had been a vegetarian for a decade; for the past five years, I had been eating a \u201cclean,\u201d plant-based diet. I took a B complex, I didn\u2019t have anemia, I drank vegan protein shakes almost daily even though they made me cringe, I drank enough water, I slept well. I should be ok. Yet here I was, crying at 2pm because I felt like zombie.And then a strange thing happened. I had not had animal protein in ten years and I hadn\u2019t craved it in nearly as long, but suddenly my body instinctively called out for meat.A few days later, I ate chicken. A week or so later, I had sausage. I was a carnivore again. Slowly, I regained strength.When I gave myself permission to eat meat again, I started to look at all the many other foods I had demonized and just how sick I had become.After that, I whittled down the list of \u201csafe\u201d foods more and more.I would allow no processed foods; everything had to be in a form that my great-grandmother would recognize. I had read that on a wellness blog somewhere; it was a way to identify if I was eating food in its purest form. (Never mind that my great-grandmother wouldn\u2019t recognize avocados or kombucha.) So no tortilla chips, no crackers, no mayo, etc. Pretty much everything from the center aisles of the grocery store was unacceptable. Whole foods only.I wouldn\u2019t eat granulated sugar, because sugar \u201clights up\u201d your brain the same way cocaine does. (As it turns out, so does sex and laughter.) All sugar had to be \u201cnatural:\u201d honey, maple, coconut.I severely limited my dairy. Cows milk was offensive unless it was fermented. We are the only animals that drink another animal\u2019s milk, I read over and over. How barbaric. How absurd. (Yet somehow yoghurt was ok\u2026) Goat\u2019s milk was better but I was a poor college student and goat\u2019s milk is expensive. Thankfully, coconut milk was declared sacred by the wellness community I followed religiously and it could be bought more cheaply. In terms of alternative milks, soy milk was antiquated, almond was adequate, and oat milk had not yet arrived. Coconut was in vogue.Gluten was of course suspect. It seemed to be like the tobacco of our time; everyone was doing it but silently it was killing us. So even when the finest sourdough was available to me, I usually passed up the chance.Eggs were questionable. They had so much fat and cholesterol. Better safe than sorry. Maybe just an organic, free range egg from time to time.I\u2019d never picked up a coffee habit, which was good because coffee could shorten your life. Green tea was better. No sugar, no milk.Vegetable oils were just downright bad. I\u2019m still not sure why. Too fatty? Too processed? Olive oil was better, but then I found out it has a low smoke point which means that if you make it too hot it gives off carcinogens, which equals cancer. So I only ate olive oil uncooked. But that was ok because I had coconut oil, a gift from the gods.I can come up with that list very easily because that is pretty much all I ate for four years. Seldom did I \u201ccheat.\u201d It wasn\u2019t worth it and I knew it. Eat one of the forbidden foods and I would kick myself for hours or days afterward. Psychosomatically, I would feel uglier and fatter after slipping up and eating something made with canola oil, or a small piece of dark chocolate with refined sugar.And every day, after eating like this, I felt so righteous. I did yoga almost every night. Each day, I walked all over my college campus with a twenty pound backpack. I got eight hours of sleep. Frequently, people commented on my weight and how delightfully \u201cskinny\u201d I was (five foot seven, 125 pounds). I was doing everything right; I was being so very good.It felt like the food I was eating would get stuck in my esophagus. I went from doctor to doctor, for medical test after medical test. No issue could be found. (Thankfully, my dad is a school teacher and I was on his insurance, which is the only thing that made this possible.) I stumbled onto some research about b12 deficiency in vegetarians \u2014 something no doctor had warned me about \u2014 so I started taking b12. The pains abated.Then my energy levels plummeted.I begged my doctors to find an answer. I asked for more tests and I gave them detailed food diaries. One doctor asked if I ate peanuts and beans. I told him yes. He said that I was then, certainly, getting enough protein so the answer must be that I was depressed. I ignored him and got a new doctor.I tried a naturopath, who if nothing else recommend an elimination diet to figure out what food sensitivities I had (because I must have at least one). After six weeks of an even more limited menu than I\u2019d previously had \u2014 I cut out all dairy, soy, nuts, eggs, gluten and coconut \u2014 I reintroduced coconut first and discovered I had a very bad reaction. Everything else seemed to be fine.That was the problem: everything was \u201cfine.\u201dDaily, for at least four years, I had a deficit of several hundred calories. This did not cause me to lose any weight because my body had gone into starvation mode. Functionally, I had no muscle. The only micro-nutrient I got all of my daily value of was fiber; everything else I lacked, but specifically I wasn\u2019t getting enough protein. I got maybe a tenth of the protein I needed, and it was never a complete amino acid profile. My total cholesterol was, at its lowest, 113mg\/dL. There is research to show that cholesterol as low as mine increases risk for depression, anxiety, suicide, cancer and heart problems.Other curious things from this time: I didn\u2019t sweat anyplace except my armpits, and that I did profusely. I knew nothing of brow-sweat or boob-sweat, despite working on a farm in the summer. I also couldn\u2019t tan; I only fried red. My hair grew very slowly and my skin was breaking out often. Also, my immune system was decimated and I had to pee constantly.All of these things have resolved since my eating got broader.I was devoted to several. Their promises of health equated to enlightenment in my eyes, because I\u2019d never felt fully well. (In retrospect, I\u2019d been severely anxious since age five and had very low self esteem.) The bloggers \u2014 almost entirely white females \u2014 were beautiful, glowing, thin, confident and they accomplished great things. They published books, the jetted off to Bali and Spain, the wore amazing clothes and did yoga in the sunshine. I was a sad, quivering American teenager who was homeschooled and friendless. Wellness blogs played upon every insecurity I had.Recently, several of the wellness bloggers I followed have started to flirt with intuitive eating. This might seem like a fine solution to the limited diet I restricted myself to. But at the time what I ate was truly all I craved. Everything else had been so demonized that it was no longer appealing to me.I believe I had an eating disorder, just not the kind everyone talks about. Mine was called orthorexia, meaning I was eating \u201ctoo well.\u201d Food was all I thought about, regardless of whether I was hungry (but I was usually hungry). I was constantly planning my next meal so that I could be sure it would be completely safe. When I ate I\u2019d stop far short of feeling \u201cfull\u201d because anything close to that feeling scared me. Food was an obsession that swallowed up my day, and nearly my whole life.Although I\u2019ve nearly always had anxiety, my depression, I believe, was largely sparked by my \u201chealthy\u201d diet. While people praised how saintly an eater I was, my body was begging for more nutrients. Since I wasn\u2019t giving it enough to work with, it had to shut things down, and I can\u2019t blame it for thinking positive emotions and logical reasoning were acceptable things to put on hold. When my diet was the most stringent, I experienced the worst of my depressive episodes and suicidal ideation. When I started to eat meat again, my depression began to fade.I remember every detail of the first time I ate a processed food again; I had Late July brand tortilla chips. A very kind new boyfriend (now husband) accepted my issues with food and patiently walked me through the stages of my guilt. The same day we had dried organic pineapple rings that were lightly sweetened with granulated sugar. It was a big day for me.Reconditioning myself to be ok with the foods I\u2019d categorized as \u201cbad\u201d has taken time and there are moments when my twisted perceptions of eating creep back in. Now I eat just about whatever I please. My diet is still composed of mostly fruit and vegetables, and I am the most clear headed I can recall being. For the first time, I have muscle and I can tan.What the wellness bloggers portray is no longer what I\u2019m after. Yes, they look lovely but I\u2019ve no way of telling if they actually feel present and strong. That\u2019s what I want now, and the only way I can get there is if I care for my body in a way that it understands. Deprivation is not its love language. It needs bounty; it needs grace.This article received a fair amount of attention, both positive and negative. So I wrote a response to the commentary, which you can find below.Written byWritten by","11321":"Wellness has become a key measure of personal success \u2014 just ask the Instagirls. We all know that the image of a successful woman isn\u2019t complete without the obligatory performative displays of yoga in exotic locations, expensive organic lunches, or \u201cfresh from the gym\u201d selfies (in full makeup). These images are more than a plea for validation. Not only do they encapsulate a signaling of wealth (and arguably whiteness) that\u2019s downright disturbing, but they continue to reinforce the notion that health is something we do, rather than something we may have limited control over.The fact is, we\u2019ve long equated the pursuit of health, particularly as it applies to weight, with morality. As a culture we judge individuals for how much time, energy and money that they devote to maintaining their personal health, often regardless of other factors that might affect an individual\u2019s ability to self-care. This attitude is an extension of the myth of individualism that is inextricably woven into our capitalist culture.Who here has never given a side-eye to an obese person on an airplane or someone lighting a cigarette on a sidewalk? It\u2019s easy to be reductive when it comes to personal responsibility and health \u2014 especially when we\u2019re looking at someone else. Making health into a virtue and disease into something that\u2019s brought on by irresponsibility means that we don\u2019t have to do anything about it as a society \u2014 least of all provide healthcare for our citizens.The fact is that, as a culture, we\u2019re addicted to perfectionism fueled by rugged individualism. We\u2019re endlessly infatuated with the notion that everything in our lives, including our health, is a question of personal responsibility. Never mind that our air quality is still killing people and that our water has been poisoned by corporations and negligent government officials that are rarely held accountable. Likewise, the fact that 2.3 million Americans live in a food desert and over 7 million people are working at least two jobs to make ends meet. Health as morality thinking is uncomfortably ableist and health is largely an economic issue. The minor detail that the CDC reports that day-to-day health behaviors, such as diet and exercise, account for less than 25% of differences in health outcomes is not even a blip on our radar. The message is still: we just need to buck up and do more so we can bootstrap our way to better health.This isn\u2019t to say that pursuing personal health goals is necessarily a bad thing but chasing health at all costs (the way our culture programs us to do) is not without consequences. Not only does the pursuit of perfection through \u201chealth\u201d lead to discrimination and leaving behind the most vulnerable in our society, there\u2019s also a pronounced cost to those who have the resources and ability to chase the dream of perfect health as well.Eating disorders like orthorexia are on the rise, especially among women. This is hardly a surprise in a culture that tells women that the way they look is the most important thing about them and then links that to an increasingly steep climb to consume only the purest of nutrition.The multi-billion-dollar beauty and diet industry has spent decades trying to legitimize itself in the face of feminism. The easiest way to do this has been to conflate the concept of physical beauty with the idea of what constitutes health, until the two become so hopelessly entangled that we can\u2019t tell the difference. The result is that we (sadly, including many members of the medical community) feel it\u2019s a moral imperative to maintain the cultural beauty and weight standard.The ways this benefits patriarchy and capitalism go far beyond the money we spend. After all, how better to get womxn, even many who identify as feminists, out of the way than to convince them to invest untold amounts of time and money into being half-starved and on a never-ending hamster wheel of pursuing the unachievable? It certainly doesn\u2019t leave much left over for smashing the patriarchy so chalk one up for the existing power structure.It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t see what\u2019s happening. Ask any good feminist and she\u2019ll explain to you how fatphobia is real and wrong. She might even point out the token fat celebrity or even a fat activist that she thinks is great. But try asking her (especially if she possesses a \u201cculturally acceptable\u201d body type) how she\u2019d feel about gaining 20 lbs and she\u2019ll likely start squirming and equivocating. Feminine conditioning is insidious. We may be able see the problem from an abstract lens and even discount or make fun of it, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not still internalizing those pictures of salad-eating ecstasy on some level.Health is determined by a multitude of factors, some of which we may have some influence over, but many of which we don\u2019t. The fact remains, you can\u2019t tell how healthy a person is by looking at them. Having a health issue is not a moral failing because personal health is not a moral issue at all. It\u2019s just another way to pit the people with the least power against one another in a capitalist patriarchy.Written byWritten by","11455":"From the shows we watch, to the food we eat, to the friends we make, to the partners we choose, we have more access to options than people could have thought feasible even twenty years ago.Logic tells us that the more options we have, the more likely we are to reach that perfect, idealized life where we\u2019ve customized every aspect of our existence to suit us perfectly.\u201cIt is another truism, in the developed, Western world, that more freedom brings more wellbeing, and that more choice brings more freedom.\u201d \u2014 Barry Schwartz, psychologist and professor of social theoryBut we\u2019re not logical beings. And in reality, too much choice has been demonstrated to reduce happiness, increase stress, and, in economic terms, reduce revenue from customers overwhelmed with options.Consider the supermarket. Let\u2019s say you want to buy some chocolate. Let\u2019s go further narrowing it down, and say you want to buy chocolate with rum and raisins in it, that costs under a certain amount.You go to the supermarket and you are still presented with a dizzying array of chocolate choices which meet your criteria. You spend ten minutes staring at your options, trying to find the best one.Finally, you grab one at random and leave. You try it at home, and you\u2019re disappointed \u2014 the rum overpowers the raisins. Maybe you should have gone with option B, or C, or D, or Z. And because there were so many options, this can\u2019t be the store\u2019s fault. It can only be yours.They provided you with so many options that the right chocolate had to be out there. You just picked the wrong one. In our heads, it\u2019s simple to believe that we could have made a better choice. So we\u2019ll always be slightly more disappointed in our decisions when we\u2019re overwhelmed with options.There\u2019s basic psychology at work here. Think about the old parable of the donkey and the hay.The donkey is placed exactly evenly between two identical piles of hay. Unable to choose which one is best, the donkey ultimately starves to death, paralyzed by indecision.The more options we have, the more we struggle to pick the \u201cright\u201d one. And the more important the decision is, the greater the pressure is to choose the correct option.But that\u2019s not so bad, you might say. Maybe it takes more time, but more choice does eventually give you the possibility of a better option?That might be so, but that doesn\u2019t take into account the active cost of decision making. When we choose something, whether it\u2019s breakfast (cereal, shake, or skip), what to do at work (email, report, or project) or even what to get as a gift (wine, chocolate or gift card) that uses up resources. Time and energy are not free, and the ocean of options threatens to drown us if we run out.\u201cAs the number of options increases, the costs, in time and effort, of gathering the information needed to make a good choice also increase.\u201d \u2014 Barry Schwartz, psychologist and professor of social theory.There\u2019s a reason all those productivity gurus out there swear by having a morning routine. It makes sense: you put a lot of thought and energy into something once and then you have a solid, energy-efficient way to start your day right, no matter what.But you can go further than just choosing the right breakfast option. The real gains in productivity when it comes to choice limitation come when you start applying choice limitation to your work life. One study found that limiting options in creative work boosted creativity.\u201cRestricting the choice of creative inputs actually enhances creativity for experienced consumers.\u201d \u2014 Anne-Laure Sellier, Clinical Assistant Professor of MarketingThis is because when we have a ton of choices before us, we tend to choose the energy-efficient route of the default option, the path of least resistance.When you have to decide between 56 different colors of yarn, you\u2019ll choose the one you used last, or the one that\u2019s closest. If you have to select between only three or four colors, you automatically give it much more thought, applying more of your creative process and deliberation to the choice.In other words, you\u2019re forced to move away from your normal way of doing things and entertain a new and different way of solving problems and living your life.Whenever you can, try to give yourself limited choice. Too much choice overwhelms your decision making process, exhausting you and nearly guaranteeing to disappoint you.Too little decision, and you\u2019ll be stuck on autopilot, static and unchanging. You\u2019ll stagnate.The perfect amount of choice will free up your mental processing power, fire up the analytic side of your brain, and maybe give you your best shot at an optimized life.Want to stay in touch?Written byWritten by","11545":"Simple single-celled organisms called prokaryotes, such as bacteria are the earliest forms of life on earth, and still abundant today. Much later evolved the more complex, but still single celled organisms called eukaryotes. From those humble beginnings came the multi-cellular life forms called metazoans. All animal cells, including humans, are eukaryotic cells. Since they share a common origin, they bear a resemblance to each other. Many molecular mechanisms (genes, enzymes, etc.) and biochemical pathways are conserved throughout the evolution towards more complex organisms.Humans share approximately 98.8% of their genes with chimpanzees. This 1.2% genetic difference is enough to account for the differences between the two species. It may be even more surprising, however, to learn that organisms as far apart as yeast and humans have many genes in common. At least 20% of genes in humans that play a role in causing disease have counterparts in yeast. When scientists spliced over 400 different human genes into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, they found that a full 47% functionally replaced the yeast\u2019s own genes.With more complex organisms, such as the mouse, we find even greater similarities. Of over 4,000 genes studied, less than ten were found to be different between humans and mice. Of all protein-coding genes \u2014 excluding the so-called \u201cjunk\u201d DNA \u2014 the genes of mice and humans are 85% identical. Mice and humans are highly similar at the genetic level.Many aging related genes are conserved throughout species enabling scientists to study yeast and mice to learn important lessons for human biology. Many of the studies cited in this book involve organisms as diverse as yeast, rats, and rhesus monkeys, and all vary in the degree of their similarity to humans. Not every result necessarily applies to humans, but in most cases the results will be close enough that you can learn a great deal about aging from them. While it is ideal to have human studies, in many cases, these simply do not exist, forcing us to rely on animal studies.Disposable SomaThe disposable soma theory of aging, proposed originally by University of Newcastle professor Thomas Kirkwood, holds that organisms have a limited finite amount of energy that may be used in either maintenance and repair of the body (soma), or in reproduction. Like antagonistic pleiotropy, there is a trade-off: if you allocate energy to maintenance and repair, then you have fewer resources for reproduction. Since evolution directs more energy towards reproduction, which helps propagate its genes to the next generation of organisms, the soma after reproduction is largely disposable. Why devote precious resources to living longer, which doesn\u2019t help passing on the gene? In some cases, the best strategy may be to have as many offspring as possible, and then for the individual to die.The Pacific salmon is one such example, as it reproduces once in its life and then dies. The salmon expends all of its resources for reproduction, after which it tends \u201csimply to fall apart\u201d. If there\u2019s little chance that a salmon would survive predators and other hazards to complete another round of reproduction, then evolution will not have shaped it to age more slowly. Mice reproduce quite prodigiously, reaching sexual maturity by two months of age. Subject to heavy predation, mice allocate more energy to reproduction than to fighting the deterioration of their bodies.On the other hand, a longer lifespan may allow development of better repair mechanisms. A 2 year-old mouse is elderly, while a 2-year-old elephant is just starting its life. More energy is devoted to growth, and elephants produce far less offspring. The gestation period of an elephant is 18\u201322 months, after which only 1 living offspring is produced. Mice produce up to 14 young in a litter, and can have 5 to 10 litters per year.While a useful framework, there are problems with the disposable soma theory. This theory would predict that deliberate calorie restriction, by limiting overall resources would result in less reproduction or a shorter life span. But calorie restricted animals, even to the point of near starvation, do not die younger \u2014 they live much longer. This effect is seen consistently in many different types of animals. In effect, depriving animals of food causes them to allocate more resources to fighting aging.Further, the female of most species live longer than males. Disposable soma would predict the opposite, since females are forced to devote much more energy to reproduction, and so would have less energy or resources to allocate to maintenance.Verdict: it fits some of the facts, but has some definite problems. It is either incomplete or incorrect.Free Radical TheoryBiological processes generate free radicals, which are molecules that can damage surrounding tissues. Cells neutralize them with things like anti-oxidants, but this process is imperfect so damage accumulates over time, causing the effects of aging.Yet large-scale clinical research trials show that antioxidants vitamins like vitamin C or vitamin E may paradoxically increasedeath rates or result in worse health [13]. Some factors known to improve health or increase lifespan, such as calorie restriction and exercise, increase production of free radicals, which act as signals to upgrade its cellular defenses and energy-generating mitochondria. Antioxidants can abolish the health-promoting effects of exercise.Verdict on the free radical theory: unfortunately, a number of facts contradict it. It too is either incomplete or incorrect.Mitochondrial Theory of AgingMitochondria are the parts of the cells (organelle) that generate energy so they are often called the powerhouses of the cell. They are subject to lots of damage so they must be recycled periodically and replaced to maintain peak efficiency. Cells undergo autophagy and mitochondria have a similar process of culling defective organelles for replacement called mitophagy. The mitochondria contain their own DNA, which accumulate damage over time. This leads to less efficient mitochondria, which in turn produce more damage in a vicious cycle. With adequate energy cells may die, a manifestation of aging.Muscle atrophy is related to high levels of mitochondrial damage. But in comparing energy production in mitochondria in young and old people, little difference was found. In mice, very high rates of mutation in mitochondrial DNA did not result in accelerated aging.Verdict: Interesting but research is very preliminary and ongoing. Arguments can be made both for and against it.HormesisIn 120 BC, Mithridates VI was heir to Pontus, a region in Asia Minor, now modern-day Turkey. During a banquet, his mother poisoned his father to ascend to the throne. Mithridates ran away and spent seven years in the wilderness. Paranoid about poisons, he chronically took small doses of poison to make himself immune. He returned as a man to overthrow his mother to claim his throne and became a very powerful king. During his reign, he opposed the Roman Empire, but was unable to hold them back. Prior to his capture, Mithridates decided to commit suicide by drinking poison. Despite large doses, he failed to die and the exact cause of his death is still unknown to this day. What doesn\u2019t kill you, may make you stronger.Hormesis is the phenomenon in which low doses of stressors that are normally toxic instead strengthen the organism, and make it more resistant to higher doses of toxins or stressors. Hormesis itself is not a theory of aging, but has huge implications for other theories. The basic tenet of toxicology is \u2018The dose makes the poison\u2019. Low doses of \u2018toxin\u2019 may make you healthier.Exercise and calorie restriction are examples of hormesis. Exercise, for example puts stress on muscles causing the body to react by increasing strength. Weight bearing exercise puts stress on bones, which causes the body to react by increasing the strength of those bones. Being bed ridden or going into zero gravity, as with astronauts causes rapid weakening of the bones.Calorie restriction can be considered a stressor and causes a rise in cortisol, commonly known as the stress hormone. This lowers inflammation and increases the production of heat shock proteins. Low levels of stress increases resistance to subsequent stressors. So, calorie restriction satisfies the requirements of hormesis. Because both exercise and calorie restriction are forms of stress, they involve the production of free radicals.Hormesis is not a rare phenomenon. Alcohol, for example, acts via hormesis. Moderate alcohol use is consistently associated with better health than complete abstention. But heavier drinkers have worse health, often developing liver disease. Exercise is well known to have beneficial health effects, but extreme exercise can worsen health by causing stress fractures. Even small doses of radiation can improve health where large doses will kill you.Some of the beneficial effects of certain foods may be due to hormesis. Polyphenols are compounds in fruits and vegetables, as well as coffee, chocolate, and red wine, and they improve health, possibly in part by acting as low-dose toxins.Why is hormesis important for aging?Other theories of aging presuppose that all damage is bad, and accumulates over time. But the phenomenon of hormesis shows the body has potent damage-repair capabilities that can be beneficial when activated. Take exercise as an example. Weight lifting causes microscopic tears in our muscles. That sounds pretty bad. But in the process of repair, our muscles become stronger. Gravity puts stress on our bones. Weight bearing exercise, such as running causes micro-fractures of our bones. In the process of repair, our bones become stronger. The opposite situation exists in the zero gravity of outer space. Without the stress of gravity, our bones become osteoporotic and weak. Not all damage is bad \u2014 small doses of damage are in fact good. What we are describing is a cycle of renewal. Hormesis allows breakdown of tissue like muscles or bones that are then rebuilt to better withstand the stress placed upon them. Muscles and bones grow stronger. But without breakdown and repair, you cannot get stronger.Growth vs. LongevityHormesis, like the disposable soma theory, suggests that there exists a fundamental trade-off between growth and longevity. The larger and faster an organism grows, the faster it ages. Antagonistic pleiotropy may play a role, in that some genes that are beneficial in early life may be detrimental later. When you compare lifespans within the same species, such as mice [18], and dogs, smaller animals (less growth) live longer. Women, on average smaller than men, also live longer. Among men, shorter men live longer. Think about a person who is aged 100. Do you imagine a 6\u20196\u2019\u2019 man with 250 pounds of muscle, or a small woman? Obesity, caused by excessive growth of fat cells, is clearly correlated with poor health.Comparing across different species, however, larger animals live longer. Elephants, for example, live longer than mice. But this can be explained by the slower development of larger animals.[21]The relative lack of predators for large animals has meant that evolution has favored slower growth and slower aging. Small animals, for example bats, which have fewer predators than other animals the same size, also live longer.Aging isn\u2019t deliberately programmed, but the same physiological mechanisms that drive growth also drive aging. Aging is simply the continuation of the same growth program and is driven by the same growth factors and nutrients. If you rev a car\u2019s engine very quickly, you can reach high speeds, but continuing to rev the engine will also result in burnout. It\u2019s the same essential program, but different timescales (short-term performance versus long-term longevity). All the theories of aging point out this essential tradeoff. This is powerful information because certain programs may be beneficial at certain times of our lives. During youth for example, we need to grow. During middle and older age, however, this high growth program may cause premature aging, and it would be more beneficial to slow growth. Since the foods we eat play a large role in this programming, we can make deliberate adjustments to our diet to preserve our lifespan as well as our \u2018healthspan\u2019.

JacuzziOur world renowned brand encompasses years of cutting edge design and technology and since 1956, the name has established itself as both innovator and inventor. The Jacuzzi\u00ae story is a warming tale of sheer determination and hard work, Such focus, dedication and drive were fundamentally cultivated with family at the heart. With 7 brothers, 6 sisters, 2 world wars and emigration, the founding Jacuzzi\u00ae family spent their lifetime exploring new ideas and experimenting with product designs to build a business.The seven Jacuzzi\u00ae brothers emigrated to California from Italy. The brothers made great strides in aviation by inventing and flying the first enclosed cabin monoplane. In the 1920\u2019s their engineering skill and interest in hydraulics and the thermodynamics of fLuids led them from the field of aviation to agriculture. Incorporating their hydraulic insight, the Jacuzzi\u00ae family later made notable advancements in the agricultural pump industry.In 1943 Kenneth Jacuzzi\u00ae developed rheumatic fever, which left him with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Recognizing that monthly hydrotherapy sessions at hospital eased his son\u2019s symptoms, lead Candido Jacuzzi\u00ae, the youngest of the 7 brothers, to develop a new hydrotherapy pump in 1956, that would give Kenneth more regular treatment at home. From that application, a small niche business developed. The family sold their portable pump, named J-300\u00ae, to hospitals and schools. The pump was later designed alongside the bath and new exclusive jet technology took the pump idea to a new level. A mix of 50% air and 50% water, turning through these special jets provided an experience like never before.Product Categories-Whirlpool Bath, Steam Shower Cabins, Shower Enclosures, Panel & Hydro-column Showers, Shower Panel, Shower Heads, Hot Tubs, Sauna, Tap-ware & Over-bath.Website- https:\/\/en.jacuzzi.eu\/2.

What counts as an eating disorder? When did I lose the right to call it health consciousness, and when was it categorized as an illness?Was it when I made myself throw up, guilty about the extra food I\u2019d eaten? Or was it before, when I skipped eating carbohydrates with lunch?Was it when I chose to run for five miles instead of having breakfast? Was it when I was proud of the weakness in my limbs, the burning in my thighs when I hadn\u2019t eaten, happy because I felt denial made me strong?I don\u2019t know. Maybe one day I simply woke up with one.I\u2019ve seen a depiction of depression as a black dog, following you around, ruining the things that once brought you joy and making easy tasks harder, invisibly.My eating disorder felt more like a shadow, subtly influencing and controlling my life right in front of me. I watched it happen and said nothing.Who was pinching my thighs, measuring my waist, putting two fingers down my throat? Who was pushing away my dinner before I was full? Who decided to keep running even though I was tired?Not me.My shadow showed me my cellulite, my stretch marks, my cheeks \u2014 she taught me to be disgusted by the bloat of my body. She hated feeding me, and she thrived on an empty stomach. She made me step on the scale, time and time again until the numbers made her happy. But they never did for long.She kept a watchful eye on my friends, making sure I never ate more than them. She was excellent at math, cataloguing the calories I\u2019d taken in and the calories I\u2019d burned. She set alarms for early morning jogs I didn\u2019t want to go on, she cleaned the toilet so she remained undiscovered.She was my constant companion, and I let her lead the way because I thought she could make me happy.With her help, I\u2019d finally be thin enough. I\u2019d finally have high cheekbones. I\u2019d be a glamorous adult, able to wear whatever I chose and look good in it.She would show me pictures of other powerful and desirable women, and together we would count their ribs. One day, she promised me, I could have that, too. People would want to be as beautiful (and as thin) as me. But that would only come with her help.I\u2019ve seen some people refer to their eating disorders by a name: Ana, for anorexia. Mia, for bulemia. To those who have never experienced one, maybe this sounds silly. It\u2019s all in your own head, after all.But to me, it feels right that they\u2019re given a shape outside of myself, because I never felt I was alone through mine.There was one body, but two minds. We shaped my teenage years, together, with a firm hand, always trying to reach what I thought was our joint goal.Like the beginning, I can\u2019t remember. I do remember that slowly, so so unbearably slowly, I pushed my shadow away. I realized she was not benevolent, she was not my happy little secret trick, she was not my older sister. I found joy in things which she once prohibited to me. I took strength from running for miles, not because it took away my calories but because it gave me power. I went up a size in jeans and didn\u2019t let her make me cry.Was it when I deleted my calorie counting app? Was it when I ate a whole tub of ice cream, guilt-free?I marvel at my arms now. They\u2019re not flabby, they\u2019re strong enough to let me do pushups. And unlike my shadow, whom I could never please, if I want to get stronger, all I have to do is more pushups.My legs propel me. They carry me home when I don\u2019t feel like paying for a taxi, and they let me dance all night if I want to. They pedal me to and from work every day.Getting over my eating disorder broadened my frame of reference. More than my arms, my legs, my soft stomach, my worth is in my mind. I am more than just my body. I can write for fun, I can make friends easily, I am good at staying in touch, and I am quick to laugh.Perhaps I will never know what brought her on, what made this shadow choose my body to inhabit. And I will never know how I finally defeated her.I know it helps to conceptualize her as just a shadow, though.

While it\u2019s true that founders are wired differently (as described by Jessica Carson and others) it\u2019s also true that the pressures of ultra-competitive, #hustleharder cultures cause elevated rates of emotional, relational, mental, and physical difficulties. The combination of these two factors help explain the stats above (for a deeper dive on the drivers of founder struggles see this piece by our partner Jake Chapman).Although this topic has gained traction in recent years and the stigma is starting to lessen, many of us (from founders to friends to investors) are still left wondering, \u201cBut what can I do about it?\u201dGiven our mandate to prevent founder burnout and grow their resiliency, we decided to gather 50 experienced investors and founders and an expert panel* at an offsite in Carmel Valley to dig in.We were floored by the outpouring of insights, passions, and desires to deepen the relationships between founders and investors. We left convinced that investors and founders must work together to change #startuplife and learn to support each other more holistically.To bring forth a world in which founder wellbeing is held up in importance alongside company success, our crew broke off into small groups to develop a set of foundational promises culminating in a #PledgeToFounders which we\u2019re launching today for the global startup ecosystem to modify and adopt.\u201cAs someone who has survived depression, a major accident, and my brother\u2019s passing, brave conversation has been the foundation for my recovery and my success. My leadership has transformed because I was able to share my truth and to ask for what I need. When we support mental health, founders and their teams perform at their best.\u201d Cherry Rose Tan, Founder and Executive Coach, For Founders by Founders.This pledge is meant to grow and evolve over time, and we invite everyone\u2019s commentary and contributions to strengthen and hone its utility.

You need nothing to meditate: no special garb, no esoteric trinkets, no supervision. Yet, when the time comes to just sit, to calm and observe the mind, many are stunned and overcome by the inevitable flood of thoughts.Thoughts of worry, thoughts of self, and thoughts of thoughts, all spring to the front of your attention. Perhaps the first real challenge of cultivating a meditation practice is realizing what exactly you are trying to do.Embarking on a psychedelic experience, on the other hand, is overwhelming in a different way. If meditation sets you on the arduous path toward the center of conscious experience, psychedelics transport you directly into the thick of it. Psychedelics, after all, are often considered a shortcut to some of the insights reached through meditation.There is some truth to this idea of psychedelics as a shortcut, but it carries misconceptions about both psychedelics and meditation. Consciousness is an elusive yet ever-present phenomenon that can be explored in many ways-using one method to skip another overlooks the compounding effect of using both, together.Thanks to advanced brain scanning technology, researchers have been able to observe and map neurological changes in altered conscious states. Some of the most interesting results come from studies where patients use psychedelics or entered meditative states. These studies confirm the common anecdotal reports of both experiences and provide a scientific explanation for the feeling of ego dissolution.Before discussing the neurological overlap of psychedelics and meditation, we must first explain an area of our brain known as the default mode network (DMN). The default mode network is aptly named. This part of our minds is active when we remember, plan, and self-reflect. It helps constitute our sense of self. By no coincidence, the DMN is often overactive in depressed patients , who struggle to stop thinking about themselves in a negative light.The DMN accounts for our normal, everyday thinking patterns that protect our sanity. At the same time, the DMN confines us to our everyday insanity.A comparative study examined different brain scans of people using LSD, psilocybin, and ayahuasca, and compared them to brain scans of people in meditative states. In psychedelic and meditative brain states, the researchers found similar alterations in the DMN . While not all psychedelic substances and types of meditation interact with the DMN in the same way, the brain scans have demonstrated that both techniques consistently disrupt our DMN and sense of self.From a subjective perspective, the changes in the DMN related to meditation and psychedelic use are accompanied by feelings of peace, moments of insight, and internal transformation. They are also consistent with findings that meditation and substances like LSD or MDMA can be used to treat depression and anxiety. If the experiential anecdotes aren\u2019t enough, now science is joining the argument that psychedelics and meditation are two sides of the same coin.There are different psychedelics and different types of meditation. Before pursuing psychedelic meditation, you should consider where you are and where you want to be. Depending on your individual experience, one psychedelic may be a better option than another.For instance, combining marijuana with meditation may be markedly different than MDMA meditation. The dosage amount, too, will significantly alter your meditation. While a low dose of marijuana combined with meditation is an experience you can direct and control, a full-blown ayahuasca trip is an entirely different type of meditation that may have to control you instead. At some point, the lines may even blur between the two practices.No matter how you decide to approach psychedelic meditation, there are a few techniques that can support the experience.Preparation is key when using psychedelics. Psychedelics are more enjoyable and manageable when you enter with an open, ready mind. When you add meditation to the mix, that mental lightness is even more critical. With adequate preparation, when the time comes to surrender to the experience, you will do so with ease.Maintain a consistent meditation practice beforehand. Without a healthy practice, someone trying to meditate with psychedelics will be in two unfamiliar territories, instead of just one. A lack of preparation may end up frustrating or derailing you.You can take additional steps in your diet and lifestyle. For example, it is common in ayahuasca ceremonies to refrain from sex, drugs, alcohol, and even certain foods. There\u2019s a physical reason for this, but these steps also frame the experience and bring it to focus.There are psychedelics, there is meditation, and there is psychedelic meditation. If you are concerned about a substance taking over your meditation, ease into your dosage, cut it down to less than you think, and work your way upwards from there. Find your balance.In your first attempt to meditate, a full dose of LSD may be too much to handle. You can lower the amount, or even try to use another substance instead. Marijuana edibles are common to pair with meditation. The delayed onset of effects and more regulated doses makes it easier to manage than many other substances, which is especially helpful with mindfulness meditation.Some substances may be more suitable for your preferred type of meditation.MDMA, for example, strongly influences your physical senses. Instead of meditating on some internal, mental processes, it may work better with meditation that involves external stimuli. For instance, you can meditate upon a piece of music, some visual stimulation, or even incorporate a physical practice like yoga or breath work. These types of meditation bring out the effects of a substance like MDMA, highlighting them as the intentional focus of the trip.Marijuana or lower doses of psychedelics like psilocybin, LSD, or ayahuasca can work well with directed types of meditation. They can enhance meditation techniques like mindfulness, contemplative meditation, and mantra repetition without hijacking the experience.Depending on your substance and personal meditation practice, adapt and adjust your approach to what you think will work best.Many therapists who treat with psychedelics use the same method, which is simple and effective. They provide a comfortable physical setting, put on relaxing music or ambience, and then get out of the way. Find yourself a welcoming place to sit or rest; somewhere you can imagine settling into for a while. Having an unobtrusive soundtrack or background audio can help you anchor your attention.If you have company during the experience, make sure they aren\u2019t trying to lead you to any particular conclusion or end. If you are going alone, the same idea applies to yourself. Maintain focus, approach it lightly, and don\u2019t force yourself.Trying to harness the mind in meditation is a bit like holding a water wiggly-those tubular, slippery, jelly-filled toys that leap out of your hand whenever you try to hold onto them. With the addition of a psychedelic state of mind, it could be like grasping with a greased hand.Too many goals and intentions can become a roadblock to learning and growth.It is essential to observe and define your desires from psychedelic meditation, and perhaps to abandon them entirely. While there are techniques that can help with your psychedelic meditation, you should not regard them as ways to \u201cget you there.\u201d Instead, use these techniques and considerations to get out of your own way.Originally published at https:\/\/thethirdwave.co on February 12, 2019.Written byWritten by","11698":"Most of us want to age gracefully and feel confident in our own skin. We know the cardinal rules: limit your UV exposure, get enough sleep, exercise regularly. But what if the most effective anti-aging strategy were right in front of you \u2014 on your plate?Keeping your body healthy on a cellular level is essential for making it strong, resilient, and youthful. Some of your daily eating habits may be causing premature aging and accelerating the aging process. This article highlights key ways to make sure your diet is helping you fight aging and leaving you with a glowing complexion.Beauty starts from within \u2014 specifically, in the gut! \u201cA problem in the bowels will lead to jowls.\u201d When your digestive system isn\u2019t functioning optimally, this shows in your face. An unhappy gut won\u2019t deliver enough of the antioxidants, vitamins, proteins and minerals that are key to good health. If you want to reverse the signs of premature aging and begin glowing from within, having a healthy gut and tackling inflammation is crucial to brighter, clearer and youthful skin.What we eat directly affects the appearance of our complexion and is a major determinant of how we age. When we consume fatty, sugary, processed foods, our skin is likely to react by becoming inflamed, swollen, and lackluster. Meals that contain healthy fats, protein, greens and healthy carbohydrates are crucial for slowing down the aging process. Here are some essentials for maintaining youthful, glowing skin.The Building BlocksThree crucial components of a skin-friendly diet are protein, healthy fats, and good carbohydrates. Besides yielding beautiful skin they also have protective and preventative effects that slow the aging process and give you a radiant glow from within.Protein is made up of amino acids, which are the building blocks for cell repair.Healthy fats have powerful anti-inflammatory effects, improving the skin\u2019s texture, suppleness and overall health. Omega-3 is necessary for healthy, supple skin and to repair the protective barrier that keeps moisture locked in. They also protect heart health, inhibit inflammation, bring balance to our hormones, support brain health and increase feelings of well-being. The most potent plant-based source of omega-3 is chia seeds, with more omega-3 than flax seed or wild Alaskan salmon. Omega-3 eggs are a phenomenal source of protein and omega-3 essential fatty acids. The key is to purchase certified organic eggs from cage-free chickens that are fed flax meal. Not only are they much more nutritious due to the high quality diet they recieve, but they taste incredible. High quality and toxin free salmon fish oil and cod liver oil are also powerful sources of omega-3\u2019s.Carbohydrates can get a bad rep, but would you still be avoiding them if you knew the anti aging power behind them? Eat good carbohydrates by increasing your daily intake of fruits and vegetables, especially vegetables high in antioxidants, such as broccoli and cauliflower. Antioxidants counteract free radicals, which can cause cell damage. Good carbohydrates also help your body release estrogen, which is known to fight wrinkles and increase collagen production.The Power of SuperfoodsDark leafy greens are rich in the antioxidant plant pigments known as carotenoids, which enhance immune response, protect skin cells against UV radiation, and help the liver enzymes that neutralize carcinogens and other toxins. Their important antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects reduce the risk of heart disease and block sunlight-induced inflammation in the skin \u2014 which leads to wrinkles and skin cancer. The Vitamin A in these leafy greens also helps normalize the production of oil, while Vitamin C, Calcium and several other phytochemical\u2019s help add fibre into the diet making it one of the most powerful superfoods to consume.Isoflavones are found in foods such as chickpeas, miso and edamame. They mimic natural estrogen, which combats aging of the skin. Higher estrogen levels decrease the body\u2019s production of collagen and elastin, leading to fine lines, wrinkles, and dry, sagging skin. Isoflavones make your body believe it\u2019s producing higher levels of estrogen than it actually is, so your collagen and elastin levels stay up.Load up on antioxidants to maintain youthful, supple and radiant skin. Acai, berries, watercress and chlorella are all incredible sources of antioxidants that help maintain healthy skin. These foods fight free-radical damage that leads to fine lines, wrinkles, dullness, sagging, and lacklustre skin. Berries are powerhouses of antioxidants and vitamins and are superb for your skin. Blueberries, already well known as antioxidants, also alleviate inflammation and support digestion, which is critical for healthy skin. Raspberries contain antioxidants too and are a rich source of Vitamin C, which is key for collagen production. They\u2019re also very high in ellagic acid, which reduces cell damage from pollution and free radicals.Turmeric has been used since ancient times for health and beauty. An outstanding anti-inflammatory, the active antioxidant properties of turmeric helps to brighten and even out out overall skin tone. It also has superior cell-protecting properties, helping to keep skin soft and supple while protecting against the oxidative stress that accelerates skin aging.Extra virgin olive oil is a great example of a healthy fat that helps to prevent and reverse inflammatory, age and disease-related changes to the heart and skin cells. It is mainly made up of monounsaturated fatty acids, the most important being oleic acid. Oleic acid is known to be incredibly heart-healthy and has the capability of fighting oxidative stress while improving focus and memory. Extra virgin olive oil also contains a type of antioxidant called secoiridoids, which helps activate gene signatures which contribute to anti-aging and a reduction of cellular stress.Extra SupportProbiotics. To keep your gut happy and healthy, it\u2019s important to load up on probiotics. These are plentiful in yogurt, kimchi, and coconut kefir. Increasing the diversity of bacteria in your gut (your \u201cgut flora\u201d) not only will keep your microbiome in balance and help ward off illness but also will support digestion so you can reduce bloat, detoxify more efficiently and clear any pesky pimples that may have popped up on your face after a night of overindulging in food and drink. Probiotics can also help with clearing acne, eczema and psoriasis.Most of us don\u2019t have perfect gut flora \u2014 everything from antibiotics to high-carbohydrate diets to being born via a C-section can compromise the balance of bacteria in our microbiome. Supplementing with a probiotic can help correct imbalances in your microbiome and support your immune system ward off illnesses. Aim to swallow 100 billion CFU (colony forming units) a day.The two main species you want to look for are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. Within these two species is a diverse range of strains. Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Bifidobacterium longum have been shown to help modulate the immune system, lessen autoimmunity conditions, and counteract infections in the gut.Bone broth is great for the gut because it contains gelatin, which restores the strength of the gut lining, reduces inflammation and supports immune system function. The collagen present in bone broth helps form elastin within the skin, which is responsible for maintaining a youthful appearance by helping reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging.Consume enough water. Water is vital to help flush out toxins and keep the skin clear and hydrated. To assess how much water you should drink each day, take your weight in pounds and divide it by two; this is how many ounces of water you should drink, as a minimum daily.Sweat it out. Lower your stress levels and boost your skin\u2019s health by \u201csweating it out\u201d on a daily basis. The skin is our largest organ, and sweat is one of the main channels for removing toxins from your body. Whether you do a workout or have an infrared sauna session, sweating daily will help your body\u2019s natural detoxification processes, leaving you with youthful, glowing skin.The \u201cHero\u201d ProductWant to nourish your skin from the inside out? Dr. Sturm has formulated Skin Food.How It WorksThe star behind this key compound is called reservatrol. When used with Japanese knotweed, these substances offer potent antioxidant, cardiovascular, liver function and anti-aging support. A combination of the highest-quality extracts of grape skins, red wine and Japanese knotweed yields a well-rounded product that supports a nutritional approach to healthy aging.The IngredientsDr. Sturm\u2019s star ingredient is purslane, a super-plant with powerful skin benefits, including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. It also activates the \u201cfountain of youth enzyme,\u201d telomerase, which is proven to stimulate cell renewal and impede the aging process while healing inflammation. Alongside purslane, glucosamine supports healthy skin by improving the body\u2019s own natural production of essential hyaluronic acid. Rounding out the formula are the high-quality antioxidants kudzu and astragalosides, which neutralize free radicals and protect against the aging process.

When my doctor recommended I try it, I was more than a little confused.I\u2019ve experienced varying levels of depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. It peaked during my years running \u00c4KTA, especially during our sale process.Depression amongst founders is incredibly common. 49% of entrepreneurs suffer from a mental health condition. Ironically, the same characteristics of our brains that give us the ability to be fantastic businessfolks also make us highly fragile in handling the pressures and risks associated with the job.Founders are:2X more likely to suffer from depression6X more likely to suffer from ADHD3X more likely to suffer from substance abuse10X more likely to suffer from bi-polar disorder2X more likely to have psychiatric hospitalization2X more likely to have suicidal thoughtsTechCrunchMy doctor had told me about new studies showing profound effects that ketamine can have on some mental illnesses, like depression. When he first mentioned it, I did some research, and didn\u2019t feel ready to go down that path. The IV treatment creates a dissociative effect, and plunges you in to your subconscious for about an hour. I honestly wasn\u2019t prepared for what I would find down there.After spending a lot of time on wellness after selling my company, I felt more prepared, and told him I was ready. I visited his posh new office in downtown Chicago and we got started.The physiological and neurological effects of ketamine are realized simply by exposing your brain to enough of the drug over a period of time. You could sit there and watch Netflix while doing it, although I am guessing it wouldn\u2019t make much sense. Perhaps this is what Black Mirror is for.But, many therapists take advantage of this highly disassociated state (not unlike DMT \/ ayahuasca) to guide you through a spiritual journey. To gain strength, answer questions, etc.For mine, I reclined in a comfortable chair with a blindfold on and a blanket. Five or ten minutes in to the IV, I started feeling a sense of deep relaxation. I was heavy in the chair, and frankly, feeling fantastic, but still lucid and present.A few minutes after that, everything changed, almost at once. My brain clicked over, and I was no longer in the room. My doctor\u2019s voice suddenly felt 1000 feet away, and I didn\u2019t feel completely confident that I could move my limbs or speak properly.He began to ask me questions about what I was feeling and seeing, and encouraging me to explore various places in my subconscious. This was weird on many levels. I didn\u2019t see too many literal places or people, but rather, symbols, shapes and art. It was beautiful, in its own way.Time slows down considerably. I thought the hour was almost over, when he informed me it had only been 10 minutes. This does create some discomfort and panic, as you ask yourself \u201cam I ever getting out of here?\u201d. The doc was great at talking me through that.Finally, the treatment is over, and you sit feeling drunk and stoned for about 30 minutes until you\u2019re able to stand. The effects over the next 36 hours were a sense of relaxation, but nothing terribly profound. Until the following day.I was back in Los Angeles, having a walk at sunset to get a smoothie. I was looking at the sky and mountains. When I had a sensation I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve had in my entire adult life: my brain was quiet. No fleeting thoughts, no brainstorming, no problem solving, no anxiety, no thinking about\u2026well, anything. My brain was perfectly at peace. It had finally shut up.The long term effects of the medication are still being determined. All I know is, while my depression has been under control for years, it still was able to bring my mind to a place I have not been able to get it to, and it was the most welcomed feeling I can imagine. Even things like meditation have become more relevant to me, since I now better understand the \u201cpoint\u201d.Founders rarely seek support, for a litany of reasons. As I see it, the top three are:In the chaos that is a startup company, trying to imagine stopping long enough to recover from an issue is unfathomable. We are redlined 24 hours a day, and turning that off is inconceivable. That intensity, and confidence, is also what makes people follow us, and believe in us.We also fear someone is going to try and \u201cfix\u201d us. While we have problems, we aren\u2019t broken. And the notion of someone approaching us like a sheet of broken glass is not going to work.It becomes easier, and more lucrative, to suppress our issues and drive forward. This also leads to the fallout and tragic fates of so many entrepreneurs and companies.The harsh reality of entrepreneurship is a topic I\u2019m deeply passionate about. My memoir on the subject is releasing soon (click here to get more info). The more we can be honest and vulnerable about the struggles that come along with entrepreneurship, the more we can proactively seek and create system of support, and together, create a movement to improve our lives.Catch me on Twitter and Instagram.Written byWritten by","11797":"Female masturbation has been a confusing topic for a while. Even writing that as an opening line feels like we\u2019ve broken a taboo by not calling it \u2018an exploration of your body\u2019. But, to be clear, we\u2019re talking about giving yourself pleasure, not checking for abnormalities.As a society we are a long way from women openly waking up and \u2018having a wank\u2019 in the way men do. It\u2019s just not part of the common vernacular.The common argument presented in the media and across magazines is that it\u2019s an embarrassing topic and women don\u2019t feel comfortable acknowledging they do it. I think there\u2019s a truth in that but I believe the problem extends further. I think many women genuinely don\u2019t do it because they don\u2019t really know how.Amongst my friendship groups, many felines would have been comfortable admitting they masturbated; showing others that they are totes comfortable with their sexuality. In the competitive landscape of post-pubescent girls, the fight to prove you\u2019re one of the most sexual was up there with other life goals. Having a high libido isn\u2019t embarrassing.Many women want to be comfortable with their sexuality. Perhaps in part because we know it makes us more appealing to potential partners but also because it\u2019s a sign we\u2019re embracing our fullest, modern, feminist selves. Somewhere between the cast of Geordie Shore and those who choose to abstain completely, lies the rest of the population of this planet, working to maintain an active sex life as an important tick in their box.The thing is, much like sex with a partner, the first few times you try and masturbate it can be somewhat underwhelming. A bit like trying to play an instrument when you haven\u2019t had any lessons. There are some sounds coming out but it\u2019s a long way from a melody.Finally though, things are looking up.Information on how to masturbate more effectively is becoming more popular. Vibrators which could be mistaken for ornaments, are being developed. Rituals which have a softness and femininity in their very nature are being walked through in magazines.Whilst sceptics may argue that making sex products flashier is purely a marketing ploy, the bottom line is that female masturbation is being normalised.And how is it being repositioned to women as consumers? Well, through \u2018wellness\u2019 of course!In fact, the growth in yoga has given the vagina a bit of a rebrand. Wellness hubs including MindBodyGreen and Dose have recently written about a personal wellness ritual named \u2018The Yoni Massage\u2019. FYI Yoni is Sanskrit (ancient Hindu) for the vulva and means \u2018divine sacred portal\u2019. HELLO.It doesn\u2019t take too great-a-leap to get to what a Yoni Massage involves, but by the way it\u2019s described and initiated, it becomes much less intimidating and includes a little personal foreplay to ease you in and extend the experience.\u201cSelf Yoni Massage gives a woman\u2019s Yoni permission to let go. In the same way that a full body massage allows a release of tension and stress, the same applies to our Yoni. If we can use this as a regular self-care routine, our Yoni will become more receptive and full of sensation\u201d. \u2014 Grace HazelGrace Hazel, quoted above, is a qualified yoga teacher and \u2018Pussy Empowerer\u2019.Whilst presenting masturbation as a holy ritual seems like a slight exaggeration, if it gives female-pleasure a rebrand and increases your chance of success, then hear hear.Personally I find the \u2018whys\u2019 of masturbation fairly straight-forward to agree on. For one, understanding your own body is quite fundamental to being able to guide someone else around it. There is a practical truth that female genitalia are generally a little more complicated to work out than our male counterparts; largely because you can\u2019t see so much of it. Beyond improving your sex life, there\u2019s also something liberating about not being solely reliant on having a partner for pleasure (single ladies, now put your hands up). The orgasm itself also has a number of health benefits, including improved circulation, relaxation and hormone balance.So if we\u2019re agreed on the whys, and have got past certain hurdles around embarrassment. Where next? Well, if feminists needed another reason to thank Emma Watson, her public shout out to the site OMGYes provides one.\u201cThere\u2019s a website called OMGYes, and it\u2019s based on research which is a complete study on female sexuality and uh\u2026 it\u2019s a pretty cool website and I wish it had been around longer\u2026 definitely check it out, it\u2019s an expensive subscription but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d \u2014 Emma WatsonA website designed to explore the science behind women\u2019s pleasure, OMGYes is a subscription service that aims to teach women that female masturbation is an act of self love. It showcases real women talking about their orgasms and what techniques work for them.So whilst you run through the investments you plan to make this year, perhaps consider giving some time (and\/or money) to this particular type of self-love. You are worth it.Yes. Yes. Yes.Originally published at cleopatrasworldwide.com.Written byWritten by","11901":"In the early 20thcentury, cancer didn\u2019t attract much attention. The biggest health problems were infectious diseases \u2014 pneumonia, gastrointestinal and tuberculosis. The American Society for the Control of Cancer (ASCC) was created in 1913 and stressed the importance of early detection and aggressive treatment. In the 1940s, they championed the routine use of the Pap smear for cervical cancer. It was hugely and stunningly successful as death rates from cervical cancer dropped quickly. This was an auspicious start. In 1944, the ASCC changed its name to the American Cancer Society.But deaths from infections would drop precipitously over the first half of the century due to improving sanitation and the momentous discovery of antibiotics. Increasing life expectancy meant that heart disease and cancer became increasingly important diseases. Since 1900, the death toll from cancer steamed relentlessly forward like a runaway freight train. The public was starting to notice, and was getting justifiably concerned.Finally, deciding that enough was enough, then President of the United States, Richard Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971. His State of the Union address actually never mentioned the word \u2018war\u2019, instead he proposed \u201can intensive campaign to find a cure for cancer\u201d. He signed The National Cancer Act into law and injected nearly $1.6 billion into cancer research. Optimism ran high. America had just put a man on the moon with the Apollo program. They had ushered in the atomic age with the Manhattan Project. Cancer? Pffff\u2026 that was child\u2019s play. Some scientists enthusiastically predicted that cancer would be cured in time to celebrate America\u2019s Bicentennial in 1976.The Bicentennial came and went, and the cure for cancer was no closer to being found. By 1981, the 10thanniversary of the war on cancer, the New York Times wondered whether this decade long war \u201cbrought real progress against this dreaded disease, or has it been an extravagant $7.5 billion misfire?\u201d Cancer deaths continued their ruthless climb, and the past decade\u2019s efforts hadn\u2019t even slowed its ascent one bit. The \u2018war on cancer\u2019 was a complete rout.This was not news to insiders, like the National Cancer Institute\u2019s (NCI) Dr. John Bailar III. He was also a consultant to the New England Journal of Medicine (then and now, still the most influential medical journal in the world) and a lecturer at Harvard\u2019s School of Public Health. In the 1970s, Dr. Bailar III started to question the effectiveness of the entire cancer research program eventually leaving the NCI in 1980. He pondered this question of what real progress had been made against cancer in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine.In the two decades from 1962 to 1982, the number of Americans who died of cancer increased by 56%. Adjusting for the increased population, this still represented a 25% increase in the rate of death from cancer, at a time when virtually every other disease showed decreasing mortality. Bailar III noted that the data \u201cprovide no evidence that some 35 years of intense and growing efforts to improve the treatment of cancer have had much overall effect on the most fundamental measure of clinical outcome \u2014 death. Indeed, with respect to cancer as a whole, we have slowly lost ground\u201d. He wondered aloud \u201cWhy is cancer the only major cause of death for which age-adjusted mortality rates are still increasing?\u201dAs an insider on the cancer wars, published in the most prominent medical journal in the world, he had yelled out \u2018The emperor has no clothes\u2019 in the hopes of energizing new thinking and new research in the stultifying morass of cancer research, which had been mummifying in reiterations of the same cancer paradigms that had failed so utterly. Bailar III just took the first step to fixing a problem, which is admitting that one exists.But the rest of the cancer establishment was not yet ready to admit a problem. His article received heavy criticism, being called \u201cerroneous\u2019 at best, and \u2018reprehensible\u2019 at worst. In the polite world of academia, this language was tantamount to the highest profanity. Dr. Bailar III became almost universally reviled within the cancer research community he had once lead. His motives and intelligence were routinely questioned. Vincent DeVita Jr, then the NCI director, called his first paper reprehensible, irresponsible and misleading while implying that Bailar himself had \u201cdeparted with reality\u201d. The president of the Americal Society of Clinical Oncology called Bailar \u201cthe great naysayer of our time\u201d. The personal attacks were plentiful, but there was simply no denying the statistics.In the previous four decades, due to steady improvements in public health, sanitation and medical science, the crude death rate from things other than cancer dropped by 24%. Deaths from cancer increased 14%. The problem of cancer was indeed getting worse but nobody wanted to acknowledge it. The cancer researcher community responded to the message that cancer situation was deteriorating, by killing the messenger. Everything is awesome, they said, even as the bodies piled up.Little had changed 11 years later, when Dr. Bailar III published a follow up paper called \u2018Cancer Undefeated\u201d. The death rate from cancer had increased by another2.7% from 1982 to 1994. The war on cancer was not just a rout, it was a massacre. Yet still, the cancer world still could not admit there was a problem with their current research. Yes, there were some notable successes. Cancer death rates for children had dropped by about 50 percent since the 1970s. But cancer is the quintessential disease of aging, so this was a major victory in a minor skirmish. Of the 529,904 deaths due to cancer in 1993, only 1699 (3%) were in children. Cancer was delivering punishing upper cuts to our face, and we had managed to tousle cancer\u2019s fancy hairdo.The war on cancer was reinvigorated by the continuing revolution in genetics throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Aha! Cancer, we thought, is a genetic disease. Perhaps at long last, we knew our ancient enemy. We opened a new front in the war on cancer, focusing our efforts on finding cancer\u2019s genetic weaknesses. A massive multinational collaboration that saw the 2003 completion of the Human Genome Project would be the first step cure cancer, we thought. This culmination of genetic knowledge that would lay out a battlefield map against cancer. But this historic milestone came and went, and we were no further in our war. An even more ambitious scheme, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was hatched. Not only 1 human genome would be mapped, but hundreds. But this, too came and went.We believed the war on cancer would be a high-tech war of laser beams, smart weapons and nuclear arsenals. Instead, it was reminiscent of the trench warfare of World War I. The front lines never moved, the war dragged on without noticeable progress, and the bodies piled up.The filibuster in cancer stands in stark contrast to the dizzying progress in other areas of medicine. From 1969\u20132014, total deaths from heart disease dropped approximately 17% despite the increasing population base in the United States. But cancer? Well, cancer is a problem. During that same time period, deaths from cancer rose a chilling 84%.By 2009, the New York Times now proclaimed that \u201cAdvances Elusive in the Drive to Cure Cancer noting that the adjusted death rate for cancer had dropped only 5% from 1950 to 2005, compared to heart disease deaths, which had dropped 64% and for flu and pneumonia, which had dropped by 58%. Once again, an American president, this time Barack Obama promised to \u201claunch a new effort to conquer a disease that has touched the life of nearly every American, including me, by seeking a cure for cancer in our time.\u201d Nobel Prize laureate James Watson, the co-discoverer of the double helix of DNA, ruefully noted in 2009 that cancer killed 560,000 Americans in 2006, more than 200,000 more than in 1970, the year before the \u2018war\u2019 began.The costs have been far from insignificant. The 2019 budget for the National Cancer Institute is $5.74 billion, all of which came from tax revenue. Non-profit organizations have proliferated like mushrooms after a rainstorm. By one count, there are more non-profits dedicated to cancer than those for heart disease, AIDS, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and stroke. Combined. In 2013, there were 339 cancer charities in Canada pulling in a massive $644 million. These are funded by the multitude of Walks for Cancer, to pink ribbon campaigns to Stand Up to Cancer Telethons to the Race for the Cure in New York\u2019s Central Park.In the United States,the American Cancer Society (ACS) generates over $800 million per year in donations to fund \u2018the cause\u2019. While we often think about thousands of volunteers working hand in hand to cure cancer, the reality is far less idyllic. In 2016, the ACS paid 368 employees more than $100,000 each. The former chief operating officer Gregory Bontrager was paid $2,343,992. The lowest paid member of the leadership team took home almost half a million dollars in 2016. The LOWEST paid. Gary Reedy, the CEO paid himself a total package of $820,777. It\u2019s little wonder that pessimists call this \u2018Cancer Inc.\u2019 While encouraging all the little old men and women to donate their last $10 for one of their lucrative \u2018Relays for Life\u2019, these executives were gorging at the massive bosom of Cancer Inc. But isn\u2019t the ACS a non-profit? Of course. It\u2019s hard to make profits when you are paying executives like they\u2019re Steve Jobs.But what about all these cancer breakthroughs we keep hearing about? Many new cancer medications didn\u2019t even exist years ago. Surely these shiny new weapons must be helpful in the war on cancer. Well, yes and no. They certainly have made a difference, but not a big one. Cancer drugs are approved in the United States by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) if they show efficacy with minimal side effects (toxicity). But efficacy can be defined in many different ways.The gold standard is to prove that new cancer drugs allow patients to live longer. But there are other ways to call a drug effective. Unfortunately, from 1990\u20132002 (Ref: J Clin Oncol 2003 Apr 1;21(7):1404\u201311. End points and United States Food and Drug Administration approval of oncology drugs. Johnson JR et al) fully 68% of the FDA approvals for cancer drugs were given for those other reasons. If these drugs did not improve survival, what did they actually do? The most common reason for approval is called the \u2018partial tumor response rate\u2019, which means that the primary tumor shrank in volume by over 50%. That sounds pretty good except that this measure is completely irrelevant to a patient\u2019s health.Cancer is deadly because of its propensity to spread, or metastasize. Cancer kills because it spreads, not because it is big. There is a subset of cancers that don\u2019t metastasize, which are called \u2018benign\u2019 because they very rarely cause significant disease. Cancers that metastasize are called \u2018malignant\u2019 because of their propensity to kill. Often, benign cancers aren\u2019t even called cancer, but a tumor, which is defined as a collection of abnormal cells, whether benign or malignant.For example, the very common lipoma, affecting approximately 2% of people at age 50, is a benign cancer of fat cells. It may grow to reach sizes up to 40 pounds. Yet despite this enormous bulk, this benign cancer is still not life-threatening. On the other hand, a malignant melanoma (a type of skin cancer) may weigh only 0.1 pounds and be thousands of times deadlier because of its propensity to spread. Once spread throughout the body, many cancers become unstoppable.For this reason, local cancer treatments such as surgery or radiation are useless once a cancer has metastasized. Surgeons go to great lengths in the quest to \u2018get it all\u2019. They will cut huge swaths of normal tissues out of cancer patients to remove even the faintest rumor of a whiff of cancer cells. Surgery for cancer is only performed to prevent metastasis, not because the cancer is too big. A cancer medication\u2019s ability to reduce the size of a tumor is irrelevant to overall survival. It is analogous to doing surgery to remove half of the cancer \u2014 almost completely useless. Every surgeon in the world would refuse to operate because it\u2019s just stupid. And they would be correct. Getting half the cancer is no better than getting none of it.Yet, the majority of new cancer drugs were approved based solely upon this completely useless marker of \u2018efficacy\u2019. From 1990\u20132002, 71 new drug approvals were granted, although due to approvals for multiple cancers, this only translated into 45 new drugs. Defining efficacy more rigorously as actually saving lives, only 12 medications cleared this bar in the 12 years from 1990\u20132002. These drugs mostly only extended life by only a few weeks or months. In that same time, the phrase \u2018cancer breakthrough\u2019 appeared in 691 published articles. The strange math goes like this:691 breakthroughs = 71 cancer drug approvals = 45 drugs = 12 drugs that barely extended patients\u2019 livesAll these shiny new weapons in the war on cancer amounted to a jeweled handle on a broken sword. It looked great, but is largely useless.Written byWritten by","11909":"Tipping the scales\u2026Weight-Watchers \u2014 which the company recently rebranded WW (yes, I know) \u2014 shed 36% off its share price as growth forecasts slimmed down for the start of 2019.Wrong sort of losses\u2026 Despite the 2017 revival, there are some major warning signs.

For three days.\u201dMy reason for seeing Dr. Schwartz that day was the same as it had been the past three visits: constipation and abdominal bloating that left me feeling (and sometimes looking) as if I was in my second trimester of pregnancy. I had long identified with the symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (which I had Googled no less than two hundred times), but Dr. Schwartz insisted on ruling out other gastrointestinal disorders before corroborating my diagnosis.If the symptoms persisted while I followed the elimination diet, he would refer me to a specialist; if not, and I began to feel better, we would slowly begin adding food groups back to find out how much of each I could tolerate.I verbally agreed to the elimination diet but knew in my heart I wasn\u2019t going to follow it. I had been a vegetarian since the age of 13 and had allergies to some fruits and most nuts; my diet was already stripped down. Plus, I was unhappy. It was February in Chicago, and daily news headlines reminded me that temperatures in Illinois had dropped below those of Antarctica that winter. I was single, had a terrible job, and was displeased with the progress I had made as a writer. Food had become my only joy, and I wasn\u2019t going to give it up to please my persnickety physician.I left Dr. Schwartz\u2019s office and set out to create my own version of an elimination diet. I selected items I was able to eat without issue \u2014 cucumber, eggs, tortilla chips \u2014 and left out those I had identified as causing pain in the past \u2014 anything with dairy or high amounts of sugar. I cut out all sources of caffeine, including chocolate, abstained from alcohol and carbonated drinks, and avoided gluten just because. After three long days of cucumber omelets and herbal tea, my stomach deflated. I could button up my jeans again, and the dull ache of inflammation disappeared.I called Dr. Schwartz\u2019s office to pass along the news, then marked the achievement with a glass of white wine and cheesy pile of eggplant parmesan, though of course the celebration was cut short after the first few bites. My intestines cramped, then swelled with the reintroduction of the trigger foods, and I abandoned the meal to lay in bed and admonish myself.A few days after the parmesan disaster, I returned to my dairy-free, gluten-free vegetarian diet, attempting to form nutritious meals from my small list of \u201csafe\u201d foods. I was ravenous almost all the time, often binging on French fries or peanut butter to fill the void. I returned to Google and found a website that rated foods based on their likelihood to cause, or worsen, symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome; to my dismay, many of the protein-rich foods I had been consuming as part of my vegetarian diet (beans, cheese, and soy) were well-known offenders.Not getting enough protein was one of the pitfalls of vegetarianism, and now, with the complete elimination of meat substitutes (many of them made with either wheat gluten, soy, beans, or a combination of all three), there was little hope for me to achieve a balanced diet. What was I supposed to do? Like Dr. Schwartz\u2019s rice diet, returning to meat felt out of the question. Vegetarianism was, and had been for years, a facet of the counter-culture lifestyle I strongly identified with, just like punk rock music and DIY. It wasn\u2019t just a diet, it was a community, and I expected it would be one I would belong to for the rest of my life.I spoke to a few vegetarian friends about the issue I was having and found that many of them had made admissions in their diets throughout the years. One friend began eating mollusks, because they didn\u2019t possess central nervous systems and couldn\u2019t feel pain; another indulged her craving for chicken salad sandwiches when she was drunk.My friends encouraged me to eat a small bit of fish or poultry to remain healthy, but their suggestions felt like affronts to my idealism. To me, eating meat meant condoning cruelty and animal torture, supporting the wretched industry of factory farming I had railed hard against in my teenage years by painting \u201cMeat is Murder\u201d on my t-shirts and petitioning my high school to add Upton Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle to the summer reading list.The hunger persisted. One afternoon, irritable at work and exhausted by the insomnia that had crept in as soon as I eliminated wheat from my diet, I flashbacked to one of my favorite things to eat as a child \u2014 sandwiches made of turkey, apple, and brie. I needed one immediately.Since apples and cheese were high on the list of symptom-causing foods, I purchased a package of turkey cold cuts from the deli next door and ate the whole thing in my office with the door closed. Not my finest moment, but one that temporarily quieted the hunger.I ate poultry again the next day, this time in the form of gluten-free chicken fingers I purchased from Whole Foods. Then I had a piece of turkey sausage during brunch. Then another package of cold cuts. I was at once repulsed and replenished by my decision \u2014 not being able to identify myself a vegetarian anymore crushed me, but I couldn\u2019t deny that feeling full and remaining asymptomatic was a welcome change.I worried about coming out as a meat eater to my friends who had always known me as a vegetarian, particularly worried about a colleague who had kept (or purported to have kept) a vegan diet since she was 11. I continued to eat salads in front of her for a few weeks until a long day left me famished and craving protein.\u201cLooks good,\u201d she said, nodding at the salmon filet I was splitting down the middle with my fork.One by one, I came out to friends, and one by one, they shrugged and told me they didn\u2019t care. No one questioned my values or tried to convince me otherwise. No one jumped out from behind the bookcase to call me a poser, or demanded I return my collection of punk rock records or unstitch the feminist patch from my jean jacket.I had worried that giving up a long-standing piece of my identity meant that I was abandoning all of it, that I would no longer be entitled to participate in the core tenets of my belief system. I worried that others would shame me for what seemed to me like a selfish decision: eating the meat of animals that had been put through pain so that I could feel less of my own.Over the years, the self-flagellation has lessened, and I have come to a quiet acceptance of my new diet. My stomach condition has improved, and I am able to once again enjoy food. Though I know I wouldn\u2019t eat animals if I didn\u2019t have to, the change has made a dent in my self-concept: I am no longer a teenager with something to prove. No longer a girl ousted by her conservative peers and needing props \u2014 Manic-Panic-colored hair, The Anarchist\u2019s cookbook \u2014 to cement her position in the alternative community.Perhaps this movement away from my teenage self represents not an obliteration of ideals, as I had worried, but creation of a new system of values. Perhaps, in place of the action-driven identity I once fostered, I am moving towards an ethos of authenticity, however uninspired and pragmatic that may feel at times.Written byWritten by","12035":"I\u2019ve seen those blog posts from a million different writers, including those that I love and respect.Writer\u2019s block isn\u2019t real. Real writers keep going.I get what they\u2019re saying; I truly do. There are some people who, given the excuse, will spend the next three decades calling themselves writers despite not writing anything, because the muse isn\u2019t striking their spirit; because every time they try to sit down, they write and crumple at the first sign of hardship.They\u2019re \u201cwriters\u201d. They just haven\u2019t written anything. Ever.Except that one blog post last year. And maybe a poem back in 9th grade.Writers have to write. And I\u2019m not looking for validation on that front. I\u2019ve done my writing today. I\u2019m doing my writing now.That doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m pulling teeth to get the words out. That it feels like I\u2019m pushing a wagon-load of cabbages up the south face of K2.(A note: just looking up which face of K2 was the worst to climb derailed me for a full 20 minutes. That\u2019s writer\u2019s block.)I\u2019m writing. I\u2019m suffering from writer\u2019s block. Those two things aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.What does that mean for today?It means that it took me longer to write less. That it was harder to focus. That my writing probably wasn\u2019t as good as it usually is. That I\u2019m going to spend less time writing.Now that\u2019s okay \u2014 it gives me time to do Ninja Writer admin stuff. So it\u2019s not completely wasted. But it also makes me question myself as a writer. It makes me wish I was doing more. It makes me feel like I was doing better.It makes me wish I was one of the people who didn\u2019t believe in writer\u2019s block \u2014 who just keep writing their 2,000 or their 10,000 or whatever words for the day. That it wasn\u2019t difficult for them. That they weren\u2019t tempted to go check Twitter ever two minutes, or wanted nothing more than to stop trying to pull teeth here, and to go check out some YouTube.It makes me wonder \u201chey, maybe if you didn\u2019t bitch so much, you\u2019d probably get more done. You\u2019d probably have a finished novel by now.\u201dWriter\u2019s block is the gift that keeps on giving, I swear. And the surest cure for it \u2014 having a life full of exciting experiences and things to do that translates into things to write about \u2014 is a little beyond me right now. So I should be doing the second best thing: reading.I\u2019ve read, like, 3 books this year.That\u2019s bad. That\u2019s really bad.Mostly because I spend a lot of time worrying about what to write on Medium, trying to come up with something, dear God, to post on the blog. And it becomes a whole anxiety ritual. I burn all of my spoons out on Medium, and I\u2019m already scraping the bottom of the barrel as it is.I used to love sitting in the bath with a book. That gave me the perfect excuse to read more. To relax, to get away from the phone and the computer, and to just breathe and read.Unfortunately, I share a bathroom with six people, so tying up the tub for a few hours so I can get through a book is something that doesn\u2019t happen. But now my brain\u2019s stuck on the idea of going to a spa somewhere \u2014 or maybe getting on an Amtrak train: no computer, no cell phone, just me and a Kindle packed full of books. And maybe some paper and pens, too.That sounds really tempting right now.Written byWritten by","12041":"When it comes to your beauty routine, sleep is one of those things we take for granted. As it turns out, sleeping is one of the best things you can do to maintain your youth. And since your body regenerates cells while you snooze, it is important to get as much sleep as you can every night. Experts recommend 7\u20139 hours.The moisture and pH levels in your skin decrease, which leads to a dehydrated complexion, redness, and breakouts.As the body isn\u2019t able to regulate the immune system properly, skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema can flare up.The best time to repair your skin is during your sleep and without time to regenerate new cells, you will start to age faster.\u201cThe evening is a time of rest and repair, when the skin heals itself from daily damage,\u201d says Joshua Zeichner, MD, board-certified dermatologist.The body produces higher levels of cortisol, which can trigger the skin\u2019s sebaceous glands to produce more oil. Oil can lead to clogged pores and breakouts.Your brain needs to associate the bedroom with rest and relaxation, so leave the laptop in the living room.Put away your phone, tablet, laptop, and any other electronic devices, as the blue light will inhibit melatonin and keep you awake all night.Lavender has a reputation for relieving stress and curing insomnia. And for good reason. Dab a few drops of lavender oil onto your temples, or wrists. Or even on your pillow.It is believed that a cooler room induces a high-quality sleep. Health experts recommend a temperature between 60-67 degrees Fahrenheit.Not only does regular exercise improve your mood and reduce stress, but it is also proven to encourage better sleep quality. Get those legs moving!You can do things like reading a book, take a bath or even plan out tomorrow\u2019s schedule, but if you\u2019re like me and sometimes work the odd night shift, I recommend at least doing this on the weekend. That way you\u2019re teaching the body to associate particular actions with sleeping, and adding those extra steps to your regime will help along the way.A good night\u2019s sleep is essential for a healthy lifestyle.

All I need to do is scroll through the productivity category, and there are at least five different writers telling me how they wake up refreshed at 5 a.m. to meditate and journal their deepest thoughts. By the time it\u2019s 8 a.m., they\u2019ve already written an entire novel and are brimming with peace and tranquility.Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 these aren\u2019t bad articles. I\u2019m all for writers sharing and swapping productivity tips, but I find it difficult to stomach these blog posts because I can\u2019t relate to them at all.I am not the kind of person who wakes up at 5 am to exercise, meditate and drink green tea. Most days, I\u2019m going to keep hitting the snooze button until I\u2019ve only left myself twenty minutes to shower, get dressed and scarf down a bagel. I\u2019m not even fully operational until my body has had enough time to digest an entire cup of coffee.Even if I did have enough willpower to drag myself up at 5 am and drink a gallon of coffee, my mind still wouldn\u2019t be ready to work. I\u2019d end up staring at a blank page for an hour while my thoughts crackled like the static noise on TV.The reality is, I am not a morning person, and because of this, the two-hour, peaceful morning routine that so many writers boast about has been out of the question for me. It\u2019s just not going to happen.My most productive period tends to be from 8 pm to 2 am, but being a night owl in a sea of early birds has made me feel out of place. Why is it that I can\u2019t stand to write in the mornings, but can whip out a six-page paper in the middle of the night?Much of my confusion has stemmed from the misconception that everyone is most productive during the mornings. However, that isn\u2019t necessarily true \u2014 while many people do thrive before dawn, I\u2019ve been learning that I\u2019m not the only one who enjoys working by moonlight.Skipping the morning routine to sleep in doesn\u2019t mean sacrificing your most productive hours. In fact, you can be just as productive during the evening as you can be during the morning \u2014 if not more.So, here\u2019s why you should forget the early morning routine, and trade it in for the night hours instead:Say what you want, but early mornings aren\u2019t usually all that peaceful. Even if you live away from the constant hum of a big city, you still have a phone \u2014 which tends to buzz, chirp and ring during the early morning. Whenever I wake up, I usually have at least a couple of emails I need to respond to, a text message or so, and some notifications to check.People \u2014 whether it be your boss, co-workers, friends, or family \u2014 tend to start contacting you early. Even if you manage to ignore your email and messages, you\u2019re probably still thinking about it. The thought of how much work you still have to do creeps into your mind, and can end up killing all your tranquil, meditation vibes.At 2 am, however, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019re getting emails from your boss. When I sit down to write and it\u2019s 10 pm, I\u2019m not distracted. There\u2019s no reason for me to message my friends, respond to work emails or scroll through social media because I\u2019ve already done that stuff during the day.A lot of morning routine writers love talking about how much more refreshed they are, but the science may not be on their side. In 1999, British scientists from the University of Westminster found that people who woke up before 7:21 am had higher levels of a major stress hormone, cortisol, in their bodies.In comparison, people who woke up later \u2014 regardless of how many hours they slept \u2014 had lower levels and tended to be more relaxed.You might think relaxation isn\u2019t that big of a deal, but anybody who\u2019s tried to be creative while they\u2019re stressed out knows how difficult it is. You\u2019re thinking about ten other projects that need your attention, and you can\u2019t focus on what you\u2019re trying to do.With all of the day\u2019s hiccups already handled and your body producing less cortisol, nighttime really does present the best time to be creative.Exercise is a key component is a lot of morning routines. Who doesn\u2019t love waking up at 5 am and heading straight for the gym?There may actually be a few benefits to turning your morning exercise into a nighttime routine. One study found that your muscular strength and function, as well as your oxygen uptake, peaked during PM hours. You could actually have a more powerful workout in the evening.And, if you\u2019ve had a tough day, there\u2019s the added bonus of letting your stress out in a healthy way. Sure, a morning workout might refresh you, but it\u2019s nothing compared to the cardio workout you\u2019ll get after a day of annoying co-workers and busy traffic.At the end of the day, it\u2019s really about what works for you. If you prefer to wake up and meditate during sunrise, then go for it \u2014 but don\u2019t be fooled into thinking this what you have to do in order to be successful.There\u2019s a misconception that the most productive people are early risers, but the truth is, we\u2019re all different. We each have an internal clock and reach our peak productivity at different times. For some people, it\u2019s early morning. For others, it\u2019s in the afternoon. For me, it\u2019s late at night.Whether you have a morning or night routine doesn\u2019t matter: you just need to find what works for you and stick with it. If you\u2019ve tried a morning routine but just can\u2019t seem to get into it, maybe it\u2019s time to swap it for a night routine.Written byWritten by","12104":"One of the first mile-posts in any theatrical production is the Off-Book day. (At least for the amateurs; I have no idea how a professional rehearsal schedule works.)Basically, this is the day that the director decrees that the actors need to have their lines memorized well enough that they can function without having the scripts in their hand during rehearsal. For many of us actors, this becomes the day that we become very good at hiding our scripts on our person and thinking we\u2019re stealthy enough to get away with surreptitious looks.For me, this was always the most harrowing part of any production. I revel in being on stage, in front of an audience, under the lights, in costume and full makeup. But the fear that comes with getting off book is . . . unreal.And it\u2019s gotten worse over time.Not counting my mostly non-speaking roles in elementary school, my real show was during senior year of high school.That first show, I remember being worried about learning lines, like any new actor. But I worked with friends, learned to handwrite my lines, and developed what I call my working script \u2014 basically, I type out all of my scenes, keeping all of the lines that aren\u2019t mine, and replacing my lines with blanks and prepositions that were supposed to trigger the rest of the line in my mind.To use an example from Qui Nguyen\u2019s She Kills Monsters (I wish I\u2019d had a chance to be in a production of this show, it\u2019s absolutely wonderful!)Agnes. I get it.Chuck. So _____ ____ I do ____ ____?Agnes. Rumor has it that you know a thing or two about D&D.Chuck. Well, ______ __________, are __ ____________ 1st _ __ _______?I picked up the skills. I learned the tricks. And while I still experienced the anxiety, it was something that I worked through. Not only did I learn the lines, but I felt comfortable that I had the lines.I was able to make that gradual transition, to where I knew that I had the lines. I went from using a crutch to walking to running with the lines. By the time we got on stage, I was ready.Between 2011 and 2016, I went through what I sincerely hope were the worst years of my life, mental illness-wise. Among other things, I thought I\u2019d never act again.And then I took the tiniest of baby steps.I had just moved back in with my Mom. And, since she was going to school, I thought I would take the opportunity to go back, as well. As a new student, enrolling late, with low priority, there weren\u2019t a lot of classes that I could take.But there were two classes in the theatre department: Beginning Acting and Oral Interpretation of Literature. Both of them with the same professor, who was also the chair of the theatre department. Meeting that professor was probably the best chance happening of my 20s. He\u2019s single-handedly responsible for getting me back on stage, something that I\u2019d honestly given up on.But even before he pulled me back into that first production, I noticed there was something different. While Oral Interpretation of Literature didn\u2019t require that we memorize anything, for Beginning Acting, we had to memorize two different monologues.With these, the anxiety was worse intense than I had ever remembered before. I put the same work into learning the monologues that I had always done with my lines before. Invested the same kind of time. But I never really got comfortable with them. I never really felt like I had a solid hold on the words.I was always afraid I\u2019d mess something up. That I wouldn\u2019t get it right. That, when I was up there delivering the monologue, something in my brain would slip, and I could irrevocably screw something up. I always felt like I was teetering right on the brink of screwing the whole thing up.It was a very visceral feeling, of constantly taking tiny baby steps forward, and not being sure if the ground would dematerialize right under my feet.I made it through the monologues. But when my professor, Ed, asked me to audition for the show he was doing that summer, I was much more hesitant. But he wanted to work with me.So I did it. After all those years, I went back out on stage. And I was anxious the entire time.I loved being back on stage. I loved working with people again. The cast and crew of that first show, especially \u2014 Peter and the Starcatcher \u2014 was the perfect return to the stage. There were so many parts of being back on stage that I loved.But that panic never really went away. I was constantly afraid of dropping lines. I didn\u2019t go so far as taking a script on stage, and there was very little off-stage time during that show. But every moment I was off-stage, I had my nose in the script.I never got to that comfortable place.Ditto with A Christmas Carol. Ditto with Charlotte\u2019s Web.And the two other shows that I was supposed to do with Ed, but had to drop out of because of other (car related, usually) problems.During Charlotte\u2019s Web, I had the script on my person during the show. I had nice, deep pockets in my blue jeans, where I could slip the book. I never took it out on stage of course \u2014 that would have been horrible \u2014 but I needed it on me every second that I was in the wings. I was reading the next sceneThe thing is, though, I was fine most of the time. I\u2019ll never claim to be perfect on the stage, but I can\u2019t remember any major screwups. Any moments where I seriously dropped a scene.But I was always afraid of screwing up. Constantly. And the fear ate away so much of the joy, to the point where it devoured the experience. There was a lot of fun and passion and good times, but that anxiety undercut it, every step of the way.I miss acting. There\u2019s still a part of me that thinks, often, about going down to the local theatre company and auditioning for a show. I don\u2019t doubt that I\u2019ll always want to be on stage.But then I remember the fear. The panic. The physiological stress reaction. The beating heart. The fear, the weight in my chest that solidifies into a solid lump of lead.I ask myself if I want to feel that again.The answer, for now, is a painful one: no.Written byWritten by","12121":"Unfortunately, the modern diet, with an overabundance of refined grains, processed foods and sugars, contains very little magnesium. Even the magnesium inside whole grains and fresh vegetables has been steadily declining in recent years because of the depletion of minerals in farming soils. That\u2019s not good enough considering magnesium is an essential nutrient and required in more than 300 chemical reactions in your body.Watch out for these 8 Common Signs of Magnesium Deficiency:1. Sugar CravingsA burning desire to eat something sweet shows that there is a lack of certain minerals in the body, in particular, magnesium, a necessary co-factor in the metabolism of carbohydrates.2. Muscle CrampsAll contraction (tightening) in the body uses calcium and all releasing of tension uses magnesium. When we are magnesium deficient, we generally run out of magnesium long before calcium. As your legs try to relax, a lack of magnesium can prevent the muscle from releasing.3. InsomniaRenowned for increasing sleep time and quality, magnesium naturally relaxes the body, lowers cortisol and reduces stress and anxiety.4. Restless legsWhen you are low in magnesium your nerve cells become overactive, sending too many messages to the muscles, causing them to constantly contract.5. Migraines and HeadachesNot only does Magnesium relax any head and neck muscle tension, it can also prevent platelet aggregation, which helps to avoid the thickened blood & tiny clots that cause blood vessel spasms and the pain of a migraine or headache.6. StressWhen you are under stress your need for magnesium increases. Maintaining an adequate level of magnesium naturally diminishes the excitability of the nervous system, limiting the stress response.7. FatigueMagnesium is responsible for transporting energy. Without magnesium, you won\u2019t have enough energy at the cellular level which may manifest as fatigue, low energy, and lack of mobility.8. Acid refluxAcid Reflux is the result of spasms of the lower oesophageal sphincter at the juncture of the stomach can leave the sphincter open, causing acid reflux or heartburn. Magnesium relieves the oesophageal spasms that cause acid reflux or heartburn.Recognise any of these symptoms?Most doctors would recommend Magnesium supplements in the form of tablets or powders. More recent studies suggest that applying topical magnesium on the skin daily is much more effective at increasing your overall magnesium levels and more likely to relieve the symptoms associated with magnesium deficiency.The highest purity of topical magnesium in the world comes from Australian Salt Lakes. A 250ml Magnesium Spray lasts about 1 year with daily use.Check out www.amazingoils.com for the best-rated products available.Written byWritten by","12188":"I suffer from a peculiar, specific, and very temporary delusion. On occasion, with no external prompting from anyone, I will be fully and completely persuaded that all my friends hate me. I will be utterly convinced that every friend I know secretly finds me irritating, annoying, cloying, foolish.It comes on suddenly, I spend the day in abject misery, and then the next day I\u2019m back to normal.This often happens to me after social gatherings. There will be a party, an event, a night out, an evening at the pub. I\u2019ll have a great time with everyone, making people laugh. I won\u2019t think twice about anything I say. People find me funny, clever, charming.Then, the next morning, I\u2019ll wake up and be consumed with the knowledge that everything I did and said was intolerable to literally everyone.I force myself to relive endlessly, over and over again, what I did, what I said. Things that seemed funny or silly then were guaranteed to make me lose every friend I have, which was immediately obvious to me now in the cold light of day.I don\u2019t just go over the events of that night, but my interactions with people as far back as a decade ago. Why am I like this? How do I have any friends at all? It\u2019s suddenly so apparent that I don\u2019t actually know anyone who likes me. It\u2019s all a ruse.I\u2019ll struggle throughout the day, and then, even though I\u2019m exhausted, I\u2019ll struggle to go to sleep, my mind still turning over ancient memories where I acted stupidly.The next morning, I wake up and feel completely normal.It was bizarre: I knew that these thoughts were ridiculous, that they would go away the next day. I knew, rationally, that they weren\u2019t true. If nothing else, surely nobody cared or paid that much attention to what I did or said. And if I was so irritating, why did people still hang out with me at all?But these thoughts still felt completely convincing. I genuinely felt that everyone I thought I could call a friend secretly despised me.Eventually I realized, as you might have done already, that this always happened to me after heavy drinking. It was a manifestation of my hangover, which was why it came and left so precipitously.With the clear vision that comes from hindsight, I find it incredible to believe I didn\u2019t connect the dots sooner. Alcohol is of course a \u201cdowner,\u201d a depressant. Medically and physiologically speaking, alcohol blocks your brain from receiving messages from nerve receptors. This affects your judgement, perceptions, emotions.I googled \u201cwhy do I feel like people hate me after drinking\u201d and was rewarded with an answer: hangxiety.The more I read about hangxiety, the more I felt relieved. All the symptoms matched for me. I wasn\u2019t alone. There were other people who had felt the weird see-saw of truly believing in something horrifying despite knowing deep down it was a temporary condition.People wrote stories about how there was nothing they could do to feel better. If friends didn\u2019t message them the next day, it was obviously because they were hated. If they did message them, it was a pity outreach.They, like me, had been brought to tears, to considering self-harm, to cutting ties with people before they could cut ties with you.I felt so validated. It\u2019s one thing to know you\u2019re being ridiculous and try to use that knowledge to pull yourself out of your funk. It\u2019s another thing entirely to see other people struggling with the same problem you have, talking about how it\u2019s affected them.The next time I was struck down by hangxiety, I knew what it was. I knew I could handle it. I drank water, I took walks in the sunshine, I ate nourishing meals. I was mindful about my thoughts and tried to treat myself well and with love.And there was even a cure: stop drinking. Stop drinking or else it can turn into something worse over time.It was a cycle: I\u2019d go to a party, feel a little nervous or stressed, have a drink (or two, or three) to calm down, have another because I was finally feeling great. I\u2019d dance, I\u2019d chat, I\u2019d feel like a perfect social butterfly who could do no wrong.Then I\u2019d wake up. On top of the headache, exhaustion, and dry mouth, I\u2019d once again be struck with the belief that all my friends found me intolerable.Everything I remembered was horrible; the gaps that I didn\u2019t remember were worse.I\u2019d struggle throughout the day, trying to distract myself with books, TV, social media, anything to get myself out of my own head.Finally I\u2019d go to bed, knowing that the worst was yet to come as I tossed and turned without being able to distract myself. But I knew if I could just fall asleep I\u2019d be fine the next day. I would vow not to drink again.Days, weeks, months later, I\u2019d be invited to a party. I\u2019d attend, saying to myself that this time, I wouldn\u2019t drink. I knew I didn\u2019t need alcohol to have fun \u2014 these were my friends, after all. I\u2019d have fun sober and not lose my whole next day to an all-consuming, unreasonable, illogical and terrifying paranoia.But I\u2019d be nervous. What if I said something stupid? What if none of my friends would talk to me? What if I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say? Milling around awkwardly, avoiding eye contact and fidgeting, I\u2019d be seized with the thought that this is why I had no true friends.I\u2019d have a drink to calm down.One thing didn\u2019t fit in with my self-diagnosis:\u201cPeople who were \u201chighly shy\u201d experienced a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in anxiety the day after drinking.\u201d \u2014 Celia Morgan, psychopharmacology professor at the University of ExeterI\u2019m not highly shy.You can ask anyone and they\u2019ll tell you I\u2019m the first to jump in to make new friends. I\u2019ve always been able to talk to anyone. I find socialization easy. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve taken pride in for as long as I can remember.Except, I suddenly remembered, I hadn\u2019t always.As a child I\u2019d been incredibly shy. As a teenager I\u2019d been very awkward and quiet, finding it difficult to talk to new people and relate with them. I remember trying to expand my circle of friends to outside the three or four I\u2019d had since I was young, and failing.When I was sixteen or seventeen, I started drinking \u2014 and suddenly making friends was easy.Looking back, I don\u2019t think all of my sudden extroversion was due to alcohol. But I do think it taught me how to loosen up. Most of my friendships started with alcohol. The only ones I\u2019ve maintained were the ones who I could learn to like without drinking.In my final year of university, when I was under more pressure than I\u2019d ever been in my life, I drank like a fish and often felt like I had no real friends. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a coincidence any longer.And even now, even though I\u2019ve thought of myself as extroverted for nearly a decade, the signs are all there. At a party, I use alcohol like a crutch, to help me become that social butterfly I so desperately want to be. I\u2019m sure I could do without it \u2014 but I\u2019ve never been brave enough to try.I\u2019ll be honest: I don\u2019t know if I have social anxiety.I don\u2019t know if the way I feel is normal for people or if it\u2019s atypical. I\u2019ve tried to google it, but to be frank I don\u2019t know how reliable a \u201cFind out if you have social anxiety disorder in 20 questions or less\u201d quiz is.I feel a little ashamed to ask for help. I feel like I\u2019m nothing special, like everyone struggles with this and gets over it without making a big deal about it. I don\u2019t want to draw attention to the fact that I\u2019m weak enough to believe the lies alcohol tells me the next morning.But you know what? If I was feeling a little under the weather and I wasn\u2019t sure why, I\u2019d call a doctor.If they told me I was fine, I\u2019d feel relieved, not ashamed, and I\u2019d move on with my day. If it turned out to be something more serious, I\u2019d gratefully accept any advice and medication they were able to provide.Mental health shouldn\u2019t be any different.People with anxiety who drink alcohol are more at risk for developing alcoholic dependencies. While I don\u2019t feel at all at risk now, I don\u2019t want to wait until it gets that bad.I\u2019ve always been ashamed of this secret weakness. I\u2019ve always been afraid that feeling of universal hatred was the truth, and every other day was a lie. I\u2019ve always been worried that everyone deals with this, but I\u2019m the one who actually has no real friends.But I\u2019m not ashamed anymore.Tomorrow, I\u2019m going to pick up the phone and call a doctor. I\u2019m going to describe my symptoms honestly with no embellishment or concealment. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 maybe I\u2019m fine and just have to learn not to drink as much. But maybe not. Either way, I\u2019ll be better than I was before.Written byWritten by","12366":"How do we know if a food is healthy? Some of it\u2019s plain common sense, so steeped in tradition that it hardly needs proof, but for less obvious food items it usually starts with an observation.We noticed, for instance, that people who drink lots of soda tend to gain weight and have a higher incidence of several chronic diseases, or that people who take multi-vitamins tend to be healthier.An observation is followed by careful study to verify that there is indeed an association between the observed exposure and an outcome. If the association actually exists, we try to find out what explains the connection, and to see if the association is a result of a cause and effect connection. In the case of soda and obesity link, it has been established that drinking soda actually drives obesity; with vitamins it turns out that taking vitamins is what healthy people that engage in various other beneficial habits \u2014 they also exercise, wear seatbelts and bike helmets \u2014 tend to do. The extra vitamins are just an association and not the cause of their superior health.Most Americans drink coffee, and it was good news to hear that drinking coffee regularly is associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson\u2019s and several types of cancer. This association has been seen in many studies, and a recent review of many meta-analysis concluded that (with the exception of certain conditions such as pregnancy and women with risk of fractures) coffee is \u201cmore likely to benefit health than harm.\u201dThe ideal next step would have been to test coffee as an intervention in a double blind, long-term study, a study in which environmental, nutrition and lifestyle parameters would be controlled. This is, of course, very difficult and expensive to do.When it comes to studying nutrition such studies are rarely feasible.But there are other ways to move forward. Another method to examine a connection between two correlated findings is to see whether there\u2019s a plausible mechanism that would make the exposure cause the outcome.This is precisely what a new study, just published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition set out to do.Chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and hormonal dysregulation are thought to be behind the development of many chronic diseases. The new study looks at biomarkers \u2014 measurable biological markers that are characteristic of biological processes and indicate particular diseases or physiological states. The researchers looked at 14 biomarkers found in blood, including some from the insulin family (C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor 1), at several sex hormones (testosterone, estradiol,) and at inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein and interleukin 6. These were studied in two very large cohorts of about 15,500 women and more than 7000 men whose coffee habits were known.And the results: Coffee consumption was associated with favorable shifts in the levels of the biomarkers tested. There were lower levels of insulin markers \u2014 high insulin secretion markers are linked with several cancers. There were lower concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers. Estrogen levels were lower \u2014 high estrogen is associated with higher risk of breast, ovarian as well as prostate cancer \u2014 and higher levels of testosterone (testosterone can act against breast cancer cells).This was true for the participants who drank caffeinated as well as decaf drinks.Because besides caffeine, coffee contains very many substances, such as polyphenols, trace minerals and diterpenoids that are thought to affect health conditions.If you love coffee the latest research about coffee and health is encouraging.Drinking coffee used to come with a dose of worry. The reason for that is that older coffee studies did not account for confounding unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and inactivity, which used to be more common among heavy coffee drinkers. Newer, better studies are finding that coffee is actually associated with good health, and the mechanism of benefit is plausible. This study adds another layer of credibility and evidence.That being said, coffee may not benefit all people: People who metabolize caffeine slowly may not find coffee helpful in the same way that people who metabolize it normally do. The reason the studies of coffee show conflicting results may be due to a genetic variability in the way people react to caffeine.Coffee also isn\u2019t for kids. Major health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend that kids avoid caffeine in coffee and energy drinks altogether, at least until age 12. Pregnant women are advised to limit coffee to about 2 cups a day.And when you think of coffee and health, a reminder: Coffee is in essence a calorie free, unsweetened drink. Coffee drinks with sugar, syrups and cream can become calorie bombs \u00ad- these aren\u2019t a healthy habit.Dr. AyalaOriginally published at https:\/\/www.drayala.comWritten byWritten by","12371":"Controlling hunger is crucial to weight loss. How do you reign in hunger? We all think that eating more or eating more often will prevent hunger, but is this really true? Standard dietary advice is to eat 6 or 7 small meals per day with the hope that this will stave off hunger and prevent overeating. If you can prevent hunger, then you may also be able to make better food choices. On the surface, it seems pretty reasonable. However, on the surface, the disastrous Eat Less, Move More or Calories in Calories out paradigms also seemed pretty reasonable, too. Like fool\u2019s gold, appearances can be deceiving, and we must dig deeper to appreciate the truth, otherwise we are the fools. So, let\u2019s think about this a little more.The most important determinant of how much you eat is how hungry you are. Yes, you can deliberately eat less, but you can\u2019t decide to be less hungry. So if you are constantly eating less, but are still hungry, it takes a toll on you, day after day, month after month, year after year. And the moment you let your guard down, you are going to eat more. You are constantly fighting with your own body. If you are less hungry, then you\u2019ll eat less. But you\u2019ll be working with your body, not against it.Obesity, as I\u2019ve explained in my book, The Obesity Code, is not a disorder of too many calories. It\u2019s a hormonal imbalance of hyperinsulinemia. The main reason we eat more calories is not lack of willpower, it\u2019s hunger. And hunger and satiety are functions of our hormones. You can decide what to eat, but you can\u2019t decide to be less hungry. In the long term, it is the amount of hunger that determines how much you eat.On the other side, \u2018Calories Out\u2019 is not primarily a function of exercise. It\u2019s determined mainly by the basal metabolic rate, which is the amount of energy (calories) required to keep our body in good working order. Energy is needed to generate body heat and to keep the heart, lung, kidneys and other vital organs working properly. You can exercise more, but you can\u2019t decide to have a higher metabolic rate. It doesn\u2019t work like that. And neither is the metabolic rate stable over time. It can fluctuate up or down 40% depending upon our hormones.Fat accumulation, even from a Calories In, Calories Out standpoint is almost entirely a hormonal problem. It is not something that people \u2018decided\u2019 to do. Nobody decided they wanted to eat more so that they could get fat. They ate more because their hunger wasn\u2019t satisfied. And there are many different reasons for that \u2014 mental and physiological. But the bottom line is that obesity is not merely the lack of willpower or a bad choice that somebody made. It\u2019s a disease that deserves compassion. Cutting calories when the problem is hormonal is not going to work. And guess what? It doesn\u2019t.Is there any evidence to suggest that eating constantly will prevent hunger? That would be a big NO. Somebody made it up, and it\u2019s been repeated so many times that people assume it\u2019s true. Mostly, it\u2019s been promoted heavily by the snack food industry to make sure that people continue to buy their products. Up until the 1970s or so, people ate 3 meals per day \u2014 breakfast, lunch and dinner. It was unusual to snack and certainly not considered a healthy habit. It was an indulgence to be done very occasionally.Eating constantly is sort of a nuisance. If you are trying to eat 6 or 7 times per day, then when are you supposed to get your work done? You are constantly thinking about what you need to eat and when to eat it. Anyways, it is clearly not necessary to snack because our body stores food energy (calories) as body fat for the exact reason of providing calories when needed. Body fat exists precisely so that we do NOT need to constantly eat. But is it useful to prevent hunger?Let\u2019s take some analogous situations. Suppose you need to urinate. Which is easier?Once that first bit of urine come out, there\u2019s no stopping until it\u2019s done. It\u2019s incredibly hard to stop once you start. That\u2019s inertia. An object in motion tends to stay in motion until something else acts to stop it.Let\u2019s think about another situation. Suppose you are thirsty Which is easier?Again, you and I both know that once you get that first sip, there\u2019s no stopping until the glass is empty. Once you start, it is easier to continue until satisfied, whether it\u2019s emptying your bladder or slaking your thirst. It\u2019s like my son. You can\u2019t ever get him into the bath. Once he\u2019s in, you can\u2019t ever get him out of the bath. But this is normal behaviour. So why do we assume this does not apply to eating?You might believe that eating a small amount constantly or \u2018grazing\u2019 will prevent overeating. If this were true, what is the point of an appetizer? The hors d\u2019oeuvre is literally served \u2018outside the main meal\u2019. For what purpose do we serve an appetizer? Is the point to spoil our dinner so that we cannot eat what the host has slaved over all day because we are full? Really? No. The whole point of an appetizer is that this is a small tasty morsel to make us eat more. Eating a small, appetizing amount makes us hungrier, not less. The reason it works is because it overcomes that initial inertia. The appetizer starts us salivating and thinking about food and therefore our appetite increases.In French, this may also be called an amuse bouche \u2014 meaning literally \u2018something that amuses the mouth\u2019. Why? So that we will eat more. It might be oysters, stuffed eggs or nuts. It\u2019s not served to fill you up so that you can\u2019t eat that expensive intricate meal prepared by the chef. Virtually all cultures in the world have a culinary tradition of whetting the appetite. The ancient Greeks and Romans stimulated their guest\u2019s appetite with little bits of fish, seasoned vegetables, cheese and olives. The Italian Renaissance writer Platina recommended thin rolls of grilled veal. Giving too large a portion would stimulate the satiety hormones, and dull the appetite. But a tiny portion almost paradoxically stimulates the appetite. This appetizing effect is no secret \u2014 being known to any person who has ever thrown a dinner party over the last 200 years.Now think about a time where you weren\u2019t really all that hungry, but it was breakfast time anyways. So, you eat because people have always said it\u2019s the most important meal of the day. To your surprise, as you start eating, you finished an entire meal relatively normally. Before you started eating, you could have easily skipped the meal and have been full. But once you started eating, you ate everything. Has this happened to you? It\u2019s happened to me many, many times, mostly because I\u2019m always aware of this fact. Eating when you are not hungry is not a good strategy for weight loss. Yet people are continually scolded for having the temerity to skip a single meal or snack. They are admonished to be sure to never miss a snack.If we eat small meals 6 or 7 times per day, as most dietary authorities recommend, then what we are doing is giving ourselves appetizers but then deliberately stopping before we are actually satiated. And then repeating that multiple times per day. This is not going to decrease our appetites, it will increase it, a lot. Now because we are hungry but have not eaten our fill, we must exert a significant amount of willpower to stop ourselves from eating. We count our calories, but we don\u2019t count the willpower we\u2019ve spent to stop ourselves from eating. Day after day it goes on.Eating WHETS the appetite. Got it? We\u2019ve known this for at least 150 years! Eating all the time so that you\u2019ll eat less soundsreally stupid, because it isreally stupid. Don\u2019t fall for it. If you hear a doctor or dietician giving you this advice, run far, far away, very, very quickly. They will literally kill you with this idiotic advice. So if eating more frequently gives you a bigger appetite, then the converse must be that eating less frequently gives you a smaller appetite. Luckily, this turns out to be true.Fasting and HungerGhrelin, originally purified in 1999 from rat stomachs, is the so-called hunger hormone. It strongly stimulates growth hormone, and increases appetite. So, if you want to lose weight on a long-term basis, you need to tune down ghrelin.So, how to do that? In one study Patients undertook a 33 hour fast, and ghrelin was measured every 20 minutes. Here\u2019s what ghrelin levels look like over time.Ghrelin levels are lowest at approximately 9:00 in the morning, the same time that studies of circadian rhythm indicate hunger is lowest. This is also generally the longest period of the day where you have not eaten. This reinforces the fact that hunger is not simply a function of \u2018not having eaten in a while\u2019. At 9:00, you have not eaten for about 14 hours, yet you are the least hungry. Eating, remember, does not necessarily make you less hungry.There are 3 distinct ghrelin peaks corresponding to lunch, dinner and the next day\u2019s breakfast. This is not a coincidence, but indicates that hunger can be a learned response. We are used to eating 3 meals per day, so we begin to get hungry just because it is \u2018time to eat\u2019. But if you don\u2019t eat at those times, ghrelin DOES NOT CONTINUALLY INCREASE. After the initial wave of hunger, it recedes, even if you don\u2019t eat. Hunger comes as a wave. After it passes, it loses much of its power. Ghrelin spontaneously decreases after approximately 2 hours without food consumption. If you simply ignore hunger and don\u2019t eat, it will disappear. The average ghrelin levels over 24 hours of fasting decreases! In other words, eating nothing made you less hungry.We\u2019ve all experienced this before. Think of a time that you were too busy and worked right through lunch. At about 1:00 you were hungry, but if you just drank some tea, by 3:00 pm, you were no longer hungry. Ride the waves \u2014 it passes. Same goes for dinner. Further it has been shown that ghrelin spontaneously decreases independently of serum insulin or glucose levels. Eating more sometimes makes you hungrier, not less. In the same vein, eating less can actually make you physically less hungry. That\u2019s terrific, because if you are less hungry, you will eat less, and are more likely to lose weight.This same effect happens over multiple days of fasting. Over 3 days of fasting, ghrelin and hunger gradually decreased. Yes, you read that right. Patients were far LESS hungry when they didn\u2019t eat for three days. This jives perfectly with our clinical experience with patients undergoing extended fasting. They all expect to be ravenously hungry, but actually find that their hunger completely disappears. They always come in saying \u2018I can\u2019t eat much anymore. I get full so fast. I think my stomach shrank\u2019. That\u2019s PERFECT, because if you are eating less but getting more full, you are going to be more likely to keep the weight off.There\u2019s also the substantial difference between men and women. There\u2019s only a mild effect for men, but women show a huge decrease in ghrelin. Women would be expected to have much more benefit from fasting because their hunger drops more. Many women have remarked how a longer fast seemed to completely turn off cravings. This may be the physiologic reason why.Intermittent and extended fasting, unlike caloric restriction diets, help to fix the main problem of weight gain \u2014 hunger. Ghrelin, the main hormonal mediator of hunger decreases with fasting, making hunger a manageable problem. We want to eat less, but be more full.Written byWritten by","12475":"Note: Written with Megan Ramos of Intensive Dietary Management Program.Have you eaten a loaf of garlic bread, a bowl of pasta, and a dish of pistachio gelato and still felt hungry? Have you come home from dinner and then ate a bag of popcorn in secret to satiate you before bed? You\u2019re not alone. I hear these stories from people every day, and I\u2019ve had some of my own. Your mind is telling you that you are full because you must undo the top notch on your belt, but your stomach is still complaining it\u2019s empty. Some people continue to eat, sometimes all day long, until mere moments before they go to bed. They feel helpless and out of control, binging on foods they know they should be avoiding.Then everybody knows people who are the complete opposite. Those people who eat half a sandwich or a small salad at lunchtime and then declare themselves completely stuffed. And they\u2019re not trying to be modest. They are actually completely full. They won\u2019t eat more because it is uncomfortable for them to do so. These people are often quite thin.Many of our IDM Programclients have undergone bariatric surgery. Their appetites were so far out of control that they felt they needed invasive, expensive surgery to regulate their unruly bodies. And despite all the promises of bariatric surgery to allow patients to lose weight and improve health, it fails almost invariably. The stories are eerily similar. Initially, they lose some weight, but after several months the weight creeps back on. But worse, they feel that their appetite is just as out of control as it has ever been. \u201cHow can this be?\u201d they ask despairingly. \u201cI\u2019ve had my stomach physically stapled to make it smaller!\u201dThey misunderstood the problem with hunger. It\u2019s not about the size of your stomach. Hunger does not occur because your stomach is too big. And if that is not the problem, then surgically cutting it smaller is not going to help. Likewise, hunger is not about your willpower or self-control. You cannot will yourself not to be hungry. You cannot \u2018decide\u2019 to be less hungry. You are hungry or you are not. Your appetite is hormonally driven. That is what we need to fix. Not surgically rewiring our intestines. Not counting calories. If you don\u2019t regulate your appetite on a hormonal level, you\u2019ll never regain control no matter how small your stomach is.We are hormonally drive to eat (we get hungry) or to not eat (we get full). If people are given dietary advice that makes them hungrier, then they\u2019ll eat more. That\u2019s not their fault, that\u2019s normal. What advice have been the cornerstone of dietary therapy for weight loss for the last 50 years? Cut a few calories each and every day by eating low fat foods, because fat is very calorically dense. We are also told to eat 6 or 7 times per day, or \u2018graze\u2019 rather than eating 3 main meals per day as all our ancestors used to do. Sounds pretty reasonable. Here\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t work at all.There are certain hormones that make us full. These are called satiety hormones, and they are really very powerful. People often imagine that we eat just because food is in front of us, like some mindless eating machine. That\u2019s far from the truth. Imagine that you have just eaten a huge 20-ounce steak. It was so delicious, you even ate a few extra slices, but now you\u2019re completely stuffed. The mere thought of eating more nauseates you. If somebody set down another 12-ounce steak and offered to give you everything for free, could you do it? Hardly.Our body releases powerful satiety hormones to tell us when to stop eating. And once these kick in, it\u2019s extremely difficult to eat more. This is why there have always been restaurants that will offer you a free meal if you can eat a 40-ounce steak in one sitting. They aren\u2019t giving away very many free meals.The main satiety hormones are peptide YY, which responds primarily to protein and cholecystokinin, which responds primarily to dietary fat. The stomach also contains stretch receptors. If the stomach is stretched beyond its capacity, it will signal satiety and tell us to stop eating.So how does the low-fat, calorie reduced diet eating 6 or 7 times per day stack up? By cutting out the fat, we don\u2019t activate the satiety hormone cholecystokinin. Because protein is often eaten along with fat (like a steak, or an egg) then you are not activating the satiety signal peptide YY. This makes us hungry. So, a few hours we eat, we get hungry again. So instead of waiting until the next meal, we eat a snack. Because snacks need to be easily accessible, it tends to be carbohydrate based, like a cracker or a cookie.It\u2019s fairly simple to prove to yourself. Think about eating steak and eggs for breakfast, which is high in dietary fat and protein. Do you imagine that you would get hungry at 10:30? Now imagine that you ate two slices of low-fat white toast with low fat strawberry jam, and a big glass of orange juice. There\u2019s virtually no fat or protein in this breakfast of champions, but you know as well as I that we are ravenous by 10:30, which sends us out on a mission to find a low-fat muffin to tide us over until 12:00.Now, instead of eating 3 larger meals, we are eating 6 or 7 smaller meals, this means that we are not activating the stomach stretch receptors to tell us that we are full and should stop eating. While cutting our stomachs to a smaller size with bariatric surgery may seem like an option, the nerves that supply the stomach are often cut during this time, so they cannot provide those all-important satiety signalsThe standard dietary advice to lose weight was doing everything exactly wrong. It could hardly have been worse if they were trying. But it wasn\u2019t a problem with the number of calories. The problem was that the diet we were told to eat for the last 50 years did NOTHING TO CONTROL HUNGER. The problem is not with the people, the problem is the advice nutritional authorities are giving to the people.The problem is amplified if we are eating, as most people are, processed and refined carbohydrates. Your blood sugar levels skyrocket telling your pancreas to produce a surge of insulin. The job of insulin is to tell your body to store food energy as sugar (glycogen in the liver) or body fat. That huge spike in insulin immediately diverts most of the incoming food energy (calories) into storage forms (body fat). This leaves relatively little food energy for metabolism. Your muscles, liver, and brain are still crying out for glucose for energy. So you get hungry despite the fact that you\u2019ve just eaten. It\u2019s the domino effect from hell if you\u2019re looking to maintain or lose weight. Because these processed foods have removed all or most of the fiber, it does not take up much space, and does not activate the stomach\u2019s stretch receptors. Because they are low fat, they\u2019re removed most of the protein and fat. So, there\u2019s no activation of the satiety signals, at a time when most of the ingested calories of food energy have been deposited in the body fat. No wonder we get hungry! After a huge meal, we can often find \u2018room\u2019 for dessert, which is usually highly refined carbohydrates, or we can still drink that sugar sweetened beverage.For years you\u2019ve been lied to. You\u2019ve been told that you lack the will power and that your obesity is your fault. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. You think your body is broken because your body doesn\u2019t respond the way you\u2019ve been told it is supposed to. You know you\u2019re following the rules. You\u2019re eating what the authorities tell you to eat. You\u2019re barely eating at all to keep your caloric intake low. You can\u2019t lose weight and you\u2019re hungry all the time. With about 70% of Americans overweight, is it possible that 70% of Americans are broken?Eliminating processed junk foods and using intermittent fasting regulates the hormones that control your appetite. People tell me all the time how they turned down bread or cake for the first time ever because they just didn\u2019t feel hungry. So, reducing refined carbohydrates and enjoying natural fats and proteins can create long lasting satiety. But how can you further reduce hunger? The answer, counter-intuitively, is fasting. Eat nothing can shrink your appetite.A young doctor at theIDM Programhad struggled with his weight for many years but eventually lost some weight with a low carbohydrate diet. He wasn\u2019t at his ideal weight, but he was happy to finally be experiencing some weight loss. But he felt like a slave to food.After spending the week with me and seeing all the ways fasting can benefit the dozens of patients, he was motivated to try a 7 day fast. He started his fast without much difficulty, but he was nervous knowing his problem with hunger. When I followed up with him, he said \u201cfor the first time in my life I turned down food because I just didn\u2019t want it. It wasn\u2019t that I was abstaining because I was fasting, I just really wasn\u2019t hungry. Megan, I\u2019ve never turned down food like that before.\u201dMany people are frightened to fast because they think it will only increase their already out of control hunger. We\u2019ve had experience working with thousands of patients adding intermittent fasting to their daily routine. One of the most consistent comments after they start fasting, is how much their appetite has gone down. They always say, \u201cI think my stomach shrank\u201d. They often report feeling full by eating only eating half the amount of food that they used to. No, their stomach didn\u2019t physically shrink, but their appetites sure did.The hormone ghrelin is also called the \u2018hunger hormone\u2019 because it turns on our appetites, so you\u2019re want to lower it. People assume that if you\u2019re fasting, your ghrelin level is going to continue to rise, but that isn\u2019t true. And most of you know this by now because you\u2019ve been hungry for years. Eating all the time does not turn off hunger and lower ghrelin. The answer to turning down ghrelin is the opposite \u2014 fasting.Hormones are cyclical, meaning they go up and down throughout the day. Circadian rhythm studies consistently find that ghrelin is typically the lowest first thing in the morning. Patients are often not hungry in the morning but they eat because they\u2019re told it\u2019s \u201cthe most important meal of the day\u201d. Ghrelin also fluctuates throughout the day, which is why we tend to experience hunger in waves throughout the day. If you are able to fast through the wave, you\u2019ll find yourself no longer experiencing the desire to eat a couple of hours later. Research shows that over the entire day of fasting, ghrelin stays stable. Not eating for 36 hours does not make people more or less hungry than when they started the fast. Whether you eat or don\u2019t, your hunger will be the same. Why? Because if you don\u2019t eat, your body will simply take the food energy (calories) it needs from your stores (body fat). You are, in essence, letting your body \u2018eat\u2019 your own body fat. Perfect! Once you open up those stores of body fat, you are not hungry, because your organs have access to all the its energy needs.Ghrelin is also observed to gradually decrease after three days of fasting. This means that people are less hungry despite not having eaten for 72 hours! And we hear this from our patients every day. Hunger is a hormonally mediated state of mind, not a state of stomach.What\u2019s even more interesting is that there a greater decline in ghrelin secretion in women than there is in our male counterparts. This indicates that women can expect to have more benefit from fasting because their hunger can be expected to decrease better than men.Most of the complications associated with fasting are mind over matter. People think they\u2019re going to be starving and it\u2019s just impossible. I understand because at that point their eating all day long and feeling like they\u2019re hungry from sunrise to sunset. This is why I encourage people to just rip off the band-aid and try to do a 24 or 36 hour fast.\u201cJust try it once,\u201d I tell them. \u201cIf it\u2019s that bad, then we don\u2019t have to do it again.\u201dNever has anyone stopped after one fast. They\u2019re surprised at just how easy it was and how satiated they feel. Fasting can give you control back.Written byWritten by","12496":"~.This home she gives me,my bed, my walls,these open arms,my physical fulfillment,this sculpted clay vessel,this body I am wed to,serves me unceasinglynight and dayin pleasure and pain.Little aches and creeksI stretch and oil,I work to get all kindsof kinks outfrom knots to play.She hosts, amuseda mind that believesit is separate, beyond her,and wholly transcendent.She asks so little of me,she is always a devoted consort,she has my heart, my back,she inspires my vision,gives me sustenance,words and love.She flows life through my veins,and fills my lungs with air,my constant companion,she never leaves me aloneeven when I ignore her, as if she doesn\u2019t needto be cared for and loved.I want to never againlose my way fromhomewhere it all beganwith a tug, a slap,and a scream, I am.~\u00a9 2019, A. Breslin. All Rights ReservedWritten byWritten by","12500":"Long before there were Cheetos, Oreos and Ritz Crackers, and processed meats were identified as some of the worst possible foods, we ate what we could grow or forage. The advent of the American snack food industry was two centuries ago, although I might posit that any handful of berries or a ripe apple is just as much a snack, and vastly better.And yes, we know that. We got that. We\u2019re tired of hearing that.Hand me the donuts, please. My hand is up. They are very hard to resist. That\u2019s how they\u2019re designed. Many of us battle with this every single day.I used to think it was just about the calories. Many still do, and that includes too many nutritionists and many more health care folks. And they are wrong. Please see Dr. Jason Fung\u2019s fine Medium piece here.For one, too many of us use our Fitbits as an excuse to gorm a pizza based on calories alone. And, using a calorie as a measure doesn\u2019t take into account the value of the food to our bodies. Even then, I could chow down on a granola or a KIND bar thinking (incorrectly) that I\u2019ve just given myself a nice boost. Yeah. To my butt. Because there\u2019s little difference between those so-called good foods and a Snickers bar, which, frankly, tastes a whole lot better. If you\u2019re going to do damage, hell, at least have fun.For example, pundits, politicians and professional healthcare folks have pounded us about salt (incorrectly, as it turns out, although pouring a cupful down your throat may not be such a good idea). Any farmer or horse owner who really loves his animals puts out a salt block. In fact, animals will walk a very long way to get salt, because the body needs it. We do too.Show me a farmer or a horse breeder who puts out an entire solid sugar block. The occasional cube, yes. But a block? They\u2019d be blockheads.And about those fries, or that sushi or that soy sauce? That pepperoni?It has more to do with the extreme high heat necessary to cook those fries, or make those great-tasting lunch meats.This article outlines a number of bad foods, but perpetuates the lie about salt. It\u2019s the kind of thing that doctor and author Ken D. Berry writes in his book Lies My Doctor Told Me. Someone does some questionable research, said research is picked up swiftly by a headline-loving media, then it evolves into gospel without the slightest challenge. Berry refers to those as medical lies. We\u2019re still being told not to eat salt.Salt isn\u2019t the issue. More so sugar. And, the Butylated Hydroxytoluene (BHT) or BHA (Butylated Hydroxyanisole) that many of our popular cereals contain. Those are thought to be carcinogens, and are widely banned by other rich countries. Why are we eating them? Why would parents who (and I heartily disagree with this) virulently fight against vaccines, then turn around and feed their kids processed meats that contain advanced glycation end products (AGEs): inflammatory compounds that are created when these processed meats are dried, smoked, and cooked at high temperatures.Just because a sweet cartoon character on a cereral box insinuates himself into our consciousness or a manly man hoists a container of (largely useless and even dangerous) protein powders doesn\u2019t make those products friendly to us. It makes money for the producer, and often makes us sick, which makes money for the predatory medical system, insurance companies and hospitals with shareholders.The body is geared to like sweet foods, the taste of fat and salt- because we need them. In their natural states. What we don\u2019t need are the pesticides, the additives, and all those chemicals that make certain foods more convenient because they are kept from rotting. The problem is that a lot of the stuff that keeps certain foods from rot may well rot us from the inside out.Salt, as a preservative, as a spice, still works.Besides: too little salt? Not only does our food taste like crap, here\u2019s what else happens:And low-salt diets could have side effects: when salt intake is cut, the body responds by releasing renin and aldosterone, an enzyme and a hormone, respectively, that increase blood pressure.(emphasis added).Another article, although it too, perpetuating the lie about sodium intake, speaks to a great overall concern about food. It\u2019s not so much what we do eat, which is what we most often discuss, it\u2019s more so what we don\u2019t. Fiber, which is far better for us than any probiotic supplement, is missing in most all of our diets.When we had to forage, the body had to wait until we could find or grow or catch or kill a source of nourishment. This is just one reason that there is a faddish fascination with fasting, as it has significant health benefits. Foods are seasonal for a reason. You and I, as Northern Americans, aren\u2019t intended to be eating nectarines in the dead of winter. I have to wonder if the environmental costs of shipping and transport truly worth it any more.Now while you and I don\u2019t necessarily have to consume eleven Indonesian wicker baskets before breakfast to get our daily fiber content, there is a strong argument for trading expensive supplements for the real thing. In most cases we take too many, and most are so full of fillers that they actually endangered folks with allergies. Utah\u2019s retired Senator Orrin Hatch virtually guaranteed a completely unregulated industry --which, by the way, paid him off handsomely for the courtesy \u2014 and loosed billions of bottles of bullshit upon us all. Caveat emptor. Don\u2019t assume your government is here to help you when it comes to either the Food Pyramid (influenced by huge farm lobbies) or supplements, thank you. Hatch\u2019s son, is of course, in the business. Of course he is. Orrin himself got his start in the business, shilling shit in a capsule to unsuspecting old folks. Now that same crap is in GNC, Walgreen\u2019s and likely, your own kitchen cabinet.Down the hatch all right. Billions upon billions down the hatch of the murderous Hatch family. For excellent advice on supplements and in fact, which can do serious harm, go here.Even if we do eat what might be traditionally fiber-rich foods, that may no longer be enough. We are getting a fraction of the fiber that our near-ancestors consumed.This change isn\u2019t just attributable to the advent of fiber-free processed and fast foods in advanced economies. More than 10,000 years ago, before agriculture and selective plant breeding, early fruits and vegetables were almost unrecognizable by today\u2019s standards.Generation after generation of farmers have since bred them to be bigger and tastier \u2014 in many cases increasing their sugar content and stripping them of fiber. Milling, meanwhile, cleared the whole-grain fractions out of our bread and bakery products, which were a major fiber source, Walter said. And meat replaced fibrous beans and lentils as the main source of protein in many parts of the world. Researchers are now documenting the health impacts of that change.I have been appalled at the American arrogance about \u201cpretty food.\u201d I once showed a photo of a twisted carrot to a women who exclaimed with disgust that \u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat THAT.\u201d Well, honey, I can introduce you to billions the world over who would be damned grateful for one single ugly carrot. The ones we have are so overbred, so beyond what Nature might have intended.We don\u2019t want to be inconvenienced by seeds in our grapes and watermelons. I for one, miss the hell out of those seeds. Nature does not make a better projectile with which to pelt one\u2019s older brother than watermelon seeds, spat at warp speed by a hightailing sister. Farmers took all the damned fun out of my favorite summer fruit. Not just the fun, but the too much of the nutritional value.The rich, sweet flavor that marked the carrots and tomatoes of my youth on the farm have been replaced by pretty, pithy and tasteless products. Ask anyone over fifty about the long-ago wonder of a steak tomato, so good that you\u2019d slap slices of that bad boy into a sandwich with mayo and you\u2019re in heaven.They no longer exist, at least in those countries that use single crop mass production. Pesticides. Where insects no longer thrive. Where even the soil is now toxic. Places where water is so scarce because corporations like Coke buy up the supplies, toxic soda is cheaper than water.I was driving south on I-75 from Tampa to Naples when the overloaded truck in front of me lost a few fruit from its load. I though they were limes.Nope. Tomatoes. Hard, like rocks, not even breaking upon landing on asphalt at 75 mph.That\u2019s not food. That\u2019s filler. A very pretty package in the supermarket with almost nothing for nutritional value. No wonder we\u2019re sick, when so much of what we might once have been able to count on as food has been fiddled with to the point that it\u2019s barely water with a skin around it.And, as you probably know already, organic doesn\u2019t mean much any more, except that you and I likely paid a very high price. The standards have such large loopholes that big producers drive their semis and profits right through them. And we still get pesticides. Here\u2019s a way to think about it and possibly protect yourself.That doesn\u2019t mean all organic is bad. It does mean do your due diligence. Follow the money. There are good people out there, but you have to work to find them. I don\u2019t buy organic unless I know the producer.The point of food isn\u2019t just to shut down the growling in your stomach. Nor is it solely to show how much money you have by wasting thousands on gold-covered ice cream in Dubai.Yah. Gold is a mineral for us like a potato chip is a vegetable. Like beer is a whole grain food. Like\u2026well, you get the message.We can laugh ourselves into oblivion with such ridiculous excuses. That said, how can any of us navigate the minefield that is our food choice spectrum and the unique demands of our bodies, mine, yours, everyone else\u2019s?Such as, if I feel sorry for myself, I have been known to stuff eight chocolate covered Krispy Kremes into my gullet because of the emotional pain. I am quite sure nobody else has ever done this. Of course not. I swear, the bad snack food industry would collapse if we were all sublimely happy.The great Buddhist monk Thich Nihat Hanh wrote that when we identify the source of our suffering, it can set us free. By this he meant that when we see that there are things we do that make us suffer, we can stop. If there are things we ingest that make us suffer, we can stop. There\u2019s more, but I\u2019ll stop there because I suffer to consider how many things I do which create suffering. As in:Part of the problem, and I suffer from it like everyone else on the planet, is that when something tastes good, we want more of it. One piece of Cadbury\u2019s turns into the whole damned bar, particularly if it\u2019s been a hard day. My body rewards me with cramps, sickness and a horrific thick feeling. I know it\u2019s coming and I damned well do it anyway. As do we all at one time or another (kindly, consider, tequila.)This is my fundamental issue with my arch enemy, the Brussels Sprout. Yeccch. I would rather eat breaded cardboard. This is also precisely what Big Food knows that we crave: sweet, salt, fat, because we are wired for them for survival. In their natural forms. Ugly or not. That\u2019s why their highly-trained food chemists manipulate their products to make them ever so much more tasty and addictive.Pure shit like Cheetos and Oreos and all the other chemical-laden, toxic crap that overwhelms most of the middle of every grocery store (and increasingly, the rest of the world\u2019s stores and shops) are often what we turn to when we are anxious, and are often the cause of even greater anxiety.In this Medium piece by Ruth Henderson, this passage gets to the heart of it:As I unloaded the details of the past few weeks to one of my closest friends, he said, \u201cWow Ruth, what a sh*tty summer. And also, I think you should go to Dairy Queen and have a huge Blizzard and eat all the toppings possible.\u201dWe so often turn to what we euphemistically refer to as \u201ccomfort food\u201d which is anything but. That food all too often, as Henderson writes, results in\u2026 negative physical responses for me, including inflammation, migraines, joint pain, thyroid issues, and, in many ways worst of all, anxiety.Key to her comment, is \u201cfor me.\u201d Aye, there\u2019s the rub.If you and I are trying to lose a pound here and there, and we grind through three bags of Chips Ahoy because we crave comfort, not only do we get sick as shit, we now feel like shit because we know what we did to our poor beleaguered bodies. Double whammy.This New York Times piece discusses the connection between food and anxiety further. While I do not in any way ascribe to meds \u2014 with the exception of those who have extreme mental health issues \u2014 I do believe that the right foods eaten with joy and pleasure can go a very long way towards helping what ails us.In all these arguments about food, nutrition (eggs are good, eggs are evil) and the ongoing ridiculousness that are national good guidelines, there is but one final truth:It\u2019s all about what works for you. Literally and figuratively speaking, what does your gut tell you? What does your body tell you? What and whom do you trust? For my part, farmer\u2019s markets, where I can find them. Green grocers, where I can find them. If I\u2019m fortunate, perhaps where I land next, I can grow my own. But I won\u2019t buy any seeds from Monsanto, the world\u2019s Darth Vader. While this article might be a bit hyperbolic, it does speak to many of the fundamental issues of this massively evil food giant.My final salvo: Almond Milk. Sugar water with a smattering of crushed almonds. If you\u2019ll buy that bullshit as healthy, you\u2019ll buy anything. Big Food is counting on it. I\u2019m sticking with water that I have filtered myself. At least I know what the hell is in it. As for the rest? Listen to your body. Not your tongue. Not the ads. Not the messaging. And that, finally\u2026I grew up on a farm. Part of a dying breed. I grew up with rich soil, dense nutrients in my foods, sweet carrots and hearty potatoes that didn\u2019t need irradiating. I don\u2019t know where we go from here. But for my part, I don\u2019t trust anything with a label or the promise of a better food through chemistry or fiddling by food scientists.Who do you listen to? Who can you trust? I like reading Markham Heid. He does his research. I read voraciously, and take everything I read with a rather large block of (perfectly good) salt. I read materials from folks who are NOT funded by Nestle or Coca Cola or Monsanto any other Big Food. There is nothing about packaged food that is healthy enough to dump fresh water for Fresca, or toss out your turnips for Taco Bell.Ultimately, if you are going to live well, you have to listen to the only wise voice you and I have: our bodies. Do the research. Understand what your unique body needs, and how those changes shift each decade, through sickness and health and injury and aging. We are our own best doctors, but we must do the research, and find nutritionists we trust.Written byWritten by","12543":"A few days back when I was in my Biology lecture the Professor mentioned a very interesting thing that caught my attention. He said that in the North-East region due to environmental factors the Vitamin D intake is very less and people of the North-East region just neglect it. I was really startled by the fact of how humans lack Vitamin D nowadays and how it will affect humanity in the future.Firstly, I want to ask what comes to your mind after reading the word- Health? Is it about you being free from any disease and being physically well?I think most of us understand Health, more or less in a similar way. But is it right to think of health like this?\u201cThose who think they have no time for exercise will sooner or later have to find time for illness.\u201d Edward StanleyHealth, as defined by the World Health Organisation(WHO), is \u201ca state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\u201d. The definition of health has evolved over time from linking health to the functioning of the body to linking it to the well-being, in terms of \u2018physically, mentally and socially'.To celebrate the global health awareness, World Health Day is celebrated every year on 7th April under the sponsorship of the World Health Organization. It is celebrated every year from 1950 not only to mark WHO\u2019s foundation but is also seen as an opportunity by the organizations to draw worldwide attention to a subject of major importance to global health each year. It is one of the eight global health campaigns marked by WHO along with,On this day WHO organizes international, regional and local events related to a particular theme which was started way back in 1995. The themes are selected such that it represents the global health issue.Healthy is merely the slowest rate at which one can die.The everyday choices you make can have a big effect on your health, your life and your wellbeing. To take care of your health you have to look after various factors that determine a healthy you. These may be your mental health, diet, exercise, sleep, environment etc. We have heard about the importance of health so many times that we have now become impervious to the word -\u2018Health\u2019.In my effort to build awareness, I am sharing some facts about health that might surprise you.These numbers don\u2019t seem to be realistic but they are. Due to these and some other factors, health problems are becoming more common than ever in the world today. This probably has to do with both progress in medical science, because of which it has been easy to diagnose health problems, and also people\u2019s lifestyle, which is becoming increasingly unhealthy. While in the past, communicable ailments were the major issues, non-communicable diseases are the primary issues today. The chief causes for common health issues are an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, environmental degradation, high-stress levels and genetics.Some of the major health issues in the world today are:Apart from that, there are various other problems that the young generation is facing. Lacking Immunity is one of them. The immune system of today\u2019s generation are weaker if compared with people some 50 years ago and this has increased the need for medical attention for those age group which is expected to be healthy. Low protein, energy-deficient diets and micronutrient deficiencies (for example zinc, copper, iron, selenium, vitamins C, A, E, D, B6, B12) impair immune function and may increase the risk and severity of infections.So what we infer from this is that even though our lifestyles are changing but it is changing at the cost of our health. If we didn\u2019t take our health and health-related issues carefully then an ill-lit future lies ahead for us.On the Occasion of the 71st, World Health Day let take a pledge that it's our responsibility to take care of our health and we can\u2019t wait and depend on anyone to solve our health-related issues.Team Technothlon wishes you a very happy World Health Day.Milan RayatLiterary HeadTechnothlon 2019\"It is health that is real wealth not pieces of gold and silver.\" Mahatma GandhiWritten byWritten by","12556":"I have heard tell that if we step out and try different things it\u2019s good for our brains and our demeanours.I decided this year to spread my wings in the art department and try wood carving. I am a watercolour artist and had never held a knife except to chop vegetables.That was about 20 years ago. I had no idea how to paint. I didn\u2019t know how to draw. But I wanted to learn. The course lasted one week \u2014 7 hours a day for 5 days. By the end of the week, I knew how to do a wash in watercolour, types of paper, brushes and paints. But I didn\u2019t know how to paint or draw.Even after taking subsequent classes, I still didn\u2019t feel I could paint.There was a good reason I couldn\u2019t paint. After every weekly session, I packed up my paints and didn\u2019t take them out again until the next session a year later.Then eventually (probably 10 years later), I heard an instructor say:If you want to be an artist, you need to do practice your art every day.Whenever we have a passion for something, whether visual arts, woodworking, writing, singing, dancing, sports etc. if we practice we improve.When we have a passion for something we improve.I am not sure about my wood carving. The jury is still out. I am too new to it to make a final decision. I like it. But do I love it? I am not sure.I practised my watercolour and finally, I could say: I am an artist.I practised my writing and finally, I could say: I am a writer.The above ideas come from The Top 7 Benefits of Learning a New Skill.Years ago I had made a soap carving with a spoon to show children how to carve with soap.That was made with a spoon.Wood carving meant using knives. Yikes.This is the instructor\u2019s sampleThis is my first project, not finished yet but I am getting there. Still, need to smooth everything.And I didn\u2019t use a bandaid \u2014 not once in 21 hours of being in the class.Written byWritten by","12583":"Self-care sounds like something coined by an Instagram model. Some of us laugh at the phrase. What a gimmick.We dismiss the idea of caring for ourselves. Not completely. But we get it wrong all the time.Self-care makes us imagine spa days and spontaneous trips to the coast. Lounging by the pool with a book we pretend to read, when we\u2019re really just napping behind those sunglasses.But self-care isn\u2019t that.It\u2019s actually boring. Difficult. Even mundane. At least at first.Self-care might start with accepting our bodies regardless of size or shape. But we also realize that these bodies run on real food \u2014 not garbage shoved into greasy paper bags. Not some fad diet, either.It means diet in the long term, permanent sense. As in what you\u2019re going to eat from now on, not for the next two weeks.We have a president who thinks self-scare means diving headfirst into a trough of fast food every night. A president who judges everyone else\u2019s body but his own. This needs to change.Self-care goes beyond individuals. Take my students, for example. Some of them experience actual food insecurity. They don\u2019t live anywhere near a store that sells fresh vegetables.As a culture, we have to realize that some people really can\u2019t afford to eat well. We can\u2019t let this continue.Self-care means giving other people the resources to care for themselves, so they can go on and care for others. And so on.It\u2019s not enough to be a healthy person in a sick culture. A healthy person in a sick culture won\u2019t last long.Self-care can look really dull.One summer, someone I worked with sat down with me at the campus dining hall for breakfast. His plate spilled over with omelettes, hash browns, bacon, sausage. You know, the works. All smothered in gravy.He did this every single morning.And he had the arrogance to laugh at my oatmeal. \u201cYou seem like a really sad person,\u201d he said more than once.It felt like he was making a special trip to my table every sunrise just to f*ck up my day. He couldn\u2019t stand to see someone taking care of herself. So he had to try something to unbalance them.Of course, this guy spent the rest of his day in the bathroom bellowing horror movie noises. You could hear them from the hallway. Meanwhile, I sailed through my problems. Even though my job was full of tsunami waves and lightning, I thrived.Self-care means you treat yourself sometimes. Not every night.You party with friends when you have the time and energy. You get laid when you actually want to be with someone.Self-care means you enjoy a one-night stand when the mood feels right. You don\u2019t go home with someone just to avoid yourself.I\u2019ve worked some tough jobs at points in my life. 70 hour weeks. Jobs where daily disasters can destroy your mind. At the end of the worst days, I went straight to the gym, then home for a shower and sleep.Other people partied all night every night, then tried to teach through their hangovers the next morning.My 20s was a story of learning how to take care of myself. You start to notice that the people who accomplish their goals spend their weekends buying groceries and doing laundry. They cook a few days\u2019 worth of meals, so their crappy Monday doesn\u2019t turn into a drive-thru lunch and dinner.They don\u2019t all go on meditation retreats. But they spend time cleaning their house and office areas. They like to organize things. They spend an afternoon alone, going for walks or just listening to music.Or they go to the park with their families.Sure, they work hard. They play hard. But they know you can\u2019t just bounce back and forth between work and play.They leave some space between the extremes. Space where they don\u2019t work or play, but just take care of things.It\u2019s more space than you\u2019d think. Even a few hours a day.Successful people don\u2019t punish themselves with 14 hour days for weeks on end. They don\u2019t let a boss\u2019s expectations crush them. They don\u2019t live at some desk. They don\u2019t expect others to, either.They don\u2019t spend all day in meetings, or pretending to work to please someone else. They\u2019ll spend a few hours on a meaningful hobby in order to get into a good headspace. Then they\u2019ll get to work.People who take care of themselves are happier and more productive. They don\u2019t lose their tempers at coworkers. Setbacks don\u2019t send them into meltdowns or tweet storms. They might look slower on the surface, but their productivity will blow you away.Many of us still don\u2019t practice real self-care. Even worse, some of us might run multi-billion dollar corporations that deny their employees the ability to care for themselves. All for profits, and the sake of delivering stuff to people really fast. Because that\u2019s what we seem to value.We need to make a better world. And we can start with caring for ourselves, and helping other people do the same.You don\u2019t have to love yourself. But you do need to live in a way that hugs your goals \u2014 or whatever you call them. Self care doesn\u2019t mean always living like a nun or a Buddhist monk. But you might spend a few hours a day pretending you\u2019re one.Written byWritten by","12617":"I became a mental health awareness advocate due to my own struggles with severe depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. When my situation finally began to improve (with the help of a psychiatrist and proper medication), I became involved in fundraising for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). I wanted to help others and let them know they do not struggle alone. I also began advocating and fighting the stigma of mental illness via my blog and social media.Even still, I struggle, but I feel I have more purpose by helping others in similar situations. This has not proven that I am immune to the beast that is depression. Occasionally, I think to myself that I\u2019m only holding on for my son and that anyone else could more easily move on from my death. That is a precarious situation\/thought process to have. So, I ask myself: What would I say to someone else in my situation? I wouldn\u2019t tell them that it\u2019s hopeless or that those left behind will be okay. However, when my depression is deep, it\u2019s easy for me to forget to ask myself that\u2026it escapes my mind. Thankfully, I\u2019ve realized this and have made sure I no longer forget. I do this by putting notes to myself everywhere: on my bathroom mirror, in my jewelry box, in my purse, in my car, with my medications, etc. The note simply states: What would I say to someone else?\u2192More advocates (and anyone who struggles) should have this question posted for themselves because sometimes\u2026they take their own lives, too.Amy Bleuel is a name you may not be familiar with, but if you are faintly familiar with advocacy programs, you may recognize the name Project Semicolon. Amy founded Project Semicolon in 2013 as a tribute to her father who took his own life in 2003. It\u2019s a nonprofit organization that primarily functions as an anti-suicide initiative.Project Semicolon\u2019s aphorism is \u201ca semicolon is used when an author could\u2019ve chosen to end their sentence, but chose not to. The author is you and the sentence is your life\u201d.Just Google Project Semicolon and you will find an infinite number of articles, tattoo images, t-shirt and jewelry options, and more. You probably know someone with a semicolon tattoo as a reminder to themselves and\/or in remembrance of someone they have lost to suicide.Although the foundation was a tribute to her father, Amy suffered throughout her life, too. She endured physical abuse by her stepmother, spent years in child protective custody, began self-harming, was a victim of sexual abuse including rape, had a miscarriage, battled alcoholism, and had five suicidal attempts.Ultimately, Bleuel died by suicide on March 23, 2017, aged 31.Every year, I participate in Out of the Darkness Walks in order to fundraise for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). In 2015, I took the challenge of raising a minimum of $1000 to participate in The Overnight. Thousands of us walked 18 miles at night throughout Dallas, TX. I met a young lady on the walk whom I ended up bonding with. She was there for herself, but also for her therapist\u2026who had died by suicide just a few months earlier.Baylor University student James Cotter took his own life just last month. He, too, was a suicide awareness advocate after his sister Carrie took her own life at age 17. He and his family had worked to raise awareness about suicide, creating the Carrie Cotter Foundation and Memorial Fund.Those struggling are put in greater danger when those who are their advocates succumb to suicide. Often the thoughts are \u201cThey couldn\u2019t avoid suicidal tendencies even though they\u2019ve spent their lives working to prevent suicide of others. What does that mean for me? Is it really hopeless to fight it?\u201dSo, I urge you, advocate or not, write yourself a note (or two or three) to remind yourselves what you would say to someone else currently struggling? You, too, need to hear it.Copyright \u00a9 2019 Alicia T. Rust. All rights reserved.Written byWritten by","12668":"The failure of diets is not our fault!Everyone knows that diets don\u2019t work. Yet hope springs eternal and we are always thinking that this time we are determined, we are going to do it, we have the willpower, we are in the zone, we can get this thing done! But can we really?Ninety percent of people who go on a diet fail to lose all the weight they want. Of the ten percent that do, most people put the weight back on within a year.So, what are we doing wrong?I am not alone in believing that weight is not just about calories in, calories out. It\u2019s not even about how our bodies process food, although we all process it differently. Our bodies burn calories differently; some people have slower metabolisms than others. We know that extreme dieting can interfere with our metabolism, that can slow our metabolism down.Later we will discuss how we can speed our metabolism up.Emotions play a large part in our eating. Some people eat because they feel; whether they are happy or sad or angry, this makes people want to eat. I think this is how we get to binge-eating.I have recently been reading a book called Brain over Binge by Kathryn Hansen. Ms. Hansen was battling bulimia where she would binge and then go to the gym the next day for 5, 6 or 7 hours. It was on one of these trips to the gym she came across a book called Rational Recovery by Jack Trimpey.The feelings around alcoholism that Trimpey described were very similar to Hansen's feelings about food\/bulimia.It is interesting that OA (overeaters anonymous) use the same principles that are used in AA (alcoholics anonymous). They even use the same book, the Big Book and the 12 step programme.Trimpey, and later Hansen say that the urge to do the compulsive behaviour (alcoholism in the case of Trimpey and binge eating in the case of Hansen) comes from our lower cortex, what some people describe as our animal brain. This is the part of our brain that deals with the most basic needs, for food, water, to keep warm, to basically keep alive.They assert that if we just tell that part of our brain, no, we aren\u2019t going to do what you want, we don\u2019t need alcohol\/junk food to deal with this issue we can wait it out and our brain will realise it isn\u2019t going to happen and the urge will go away.The importance seems to be in recognising that it is one part of our brain, a simplistic part perhaps, that is telling us we need to deal with this issue in this way. When we use our higher brains to decide, actually, no, I am not going to do that, then the solution is simple.Hansen states: \u201cI realized that I was healthy, my brain was healthy, and I\u2019d been healthy all along. There was no longer a mystery as to how I would stop my bulimia. Now that I knew my urges were the real problem, and now that I knew these urges weren\u2019t really me, I realized that all I had to do was completely separate myself from them and not act on them. \u201cTo me, it seems to distance oneself from the issue, addressing it to a different part of the brain, is very important to psychology. It almost gives the person addicted to alcohol or food a way of seeing the issue from an outsiders point of view.Personally, on my last urge to binge, I didn\u2019t binge-eat after reading this. I had a desert, so I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t eat anything sweet, but I didn\u2019t stuff myself to the point of being uncomfortable. Many people who have read the book and given their reviews said they hadn\u2019t binged for varying periods of time and felt they would never binge again.This goes against the general thinking that people binge eat because of underlying emotional issues, and when we deal with the emotional issues the binge eating will stop.If people are binge-eaters and that is the only issue, then clearly this advice may be all that is needed to help people lose weight permanently.I believe that binge eating is only part of the problem with many people, myself included. Binge-eating is just one of the ways in which I ensure that my body stays the size that it is. The reason my body needs to stay this size is that I don\u2019t feel safe being any smaller.If we look at situations where a person, child or adult might feel unsafe, we can often find there is a link between the situation and obesity. This often also correlates with morbid obesity.For example, this study: https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4659571\/ on bullying and obesity in young people in Italy concludes:\u201cObesity and bullying among children and adolescents are of ongoing concern worldwide and may be closely related. Common strategies of intervention are needed to cope with these two social health challenges.\u201dA person who is bullied would feel unsafe. These feelings correlate to eating. A person who has been bullied and is overweight would go on to bully others. This cyclic effect perpetuates disordered eating.Having an alcoholic parent may cause a person to fear for their safety, and in this Psychological Profile of the Morbidly Obese, Gerbrand Hout acknowledges:\u2018Concerning family relationships, many obese persons have a history of early parental loss, parental alcoholism, and they often have marital family dysfunction in their own lives\u2026\u2019Of course, childhood sexual abuse is another reason why children and adults may be in a state of fear and not feel safe. The website obesityaction.org describes it this way:\u201cThe association between childhood obesity and sexual abuse is strongest in children and adults with severe obesity. It is generally thought that extreme obesity is rare; however, it affects nine million adults and two million children in the U.S.\u201dWe can see here a clear correlation between issues around safety and morbid obesity. Jon Gabriel, author of \u201cThe Gabriel Method\u201d himself contributes his weight gain to fear that stemmed from his father. He found himself working with a man who was like his father in that he screamed and shouted when things went wrong. Jon put on weight until he was 412lbs, feeling that the weight was protecting him and no-one would dare hit someone of his size, that he could fight back. By working through his fear, using the Gabriel Method, he lost weight and now weighs 185lbs and has kept the weight off for a number of years.What Can We Do?First of all, we need to acknowledge that the issue is far more complex than we first thought. For every individual, there may be multiple reasons why we are overweight or obese.Deal with the Physical FactorsIf we have a poor metabolic rate then one way it can be restored to normal is by taking regular saunas.While the studies that have been done are relatively small, a study of all studies taken collectively by Dr Hussain revealed a consistency of result in relation to thermodynamics.The heat the body receives while in the sauna does indeed mean we can improve our metabolic rate by going to a sauna regularly. Another positive that exists is the increase in insulin sensitivity. Insulin tells our body how much fat to absorb and store. If our body is more sensitive to insulin, then it will need less insulin and thus will store less fat.The whole relationship between fat and insulin is more complex than I can cover here, however, for more information please reference this article.Another physical factor is sleep. Sleep is very important for weight loss and certainly, in people who are morbidly obese, there is an increased likelihood of sleep apnoea. If you have sleep apnoea you will wake up for very short periods of time \u2014 seconds \u2014 constantly throughout the night. Your airways are constricted, which is what wakes you up. It is dangerous because you stop breathing and your body wakes you up to force you to breathe, keeping you alive.This means you are not getting enough sleep.In this particular study on sleep, the participants were split into two groups, one having 5.5 hours of sleep and one group having 8.5 hours of sleep per night. The group with only 5.5 hours of sleep had a lower reduction of body-mass, by 55%! Yes, the people who had less sleep lost half as much weight as the group which had 8.5 hours of sleep.It\u2019s not just the physiological differences. Anyone who has had sleep problems knows it is more difficult to stick to a diet when you are tired. There is a reason for that \u2014 your body is more hungry when you are tired, it will be telling you to eat more. Sleep is essential for a good weight loss if you are trying to restrict your food intake.If you think you might have sleep apnoea then see a doctor and get yourself tested if at all possible. If you don\u2019t have sleep apnoea then you can help yourself with your relationship with food by sleeping as much as you need to. By getting at least 8 hours of sleep per night you will be more comfortable and competent at regulating your food intake.Deal with the Psychological AspectsIf you have experienced bullying, child abuse, loss of a parent or you feel generally unsafe, go to counselling to address the problems. If you feel unsafe and your weight makes you feel safer, then unless you deal with the underlying causes you are not going to lose weight in a sustainable way.I am not saying you won\u2019t be able to lose weight at all; clearly, we can all force ourselves to lose weight. But if we are looking for long-term sustainable weight loss for the rest of our lives, then we need to look at all aspects of weight loss.Let me just speak about my own example for a moment. I have known about saunas speeding up my metabolic rate for years now. Perhaps three years? During that time, how many times have I been to the sauna? Once.Why is that, Ruth?Because I feel safe being overweight. My father died when I was six, and I haven\u2019t felt safe since. I haven\u2019t been to a sauna to reset my metabolic rate because deep down inside I didn\u2019t want to lose weight. I felt it wasn\u2019t safe to lose weight.So I needed to go to counselling and work on myself and do umpteen self-help exercises. Now I am at the stage where I do feel safe. Once I am truly convinced of that, I will go to the sauna and it will help me regulate my metabolism and lose weight.For me, and I suspect for many of us battling our weight issues, we need to get the psychological issues out of the way first. Once we have dealt with our emotions, then our complicated brains will allow us to go on to do the practical things we need to do in order to lose weight.This is why diets don\u2019t work, generally. They are looking at the wrong end of the problem. It\u2019s like an iceberg, the biggest reasons why we are overweight and unable to do something about it is because we are just looking at the tip. Get right down to the base and, if we are willing and able to do the work, then perhaps we can find our own personal effective, permanent solution to our weight loss issue.Written byWritten by","12698":"I have struggled with body image since age 10. I have tried an elaborate range of weight control techniques including fat free, low carb, juice cleanses, Keto, Paleo, counting macros, food journals and good old-fashioned starvation.By my mid-30\u2019s, I had learned to bury my head in the sand when I stepped on the scale, and rationalize whatever number came up with excuses such as water weight, \u2018big boned,\u201d scale is broken, etc. I was at a weight which was considered unhealthy by BMI and most medical standards, despite exercising regularly and being hungry and tired often.My wake-up call came during a trip to Africa, where I was drinking heavily, eating starchy foods and feeling badly about myself every time I looked at a photo. My face was bloated and my clothes barely fit. The trip through Tanzania and Zanzibar was thrilling and magical, however I spent many hours sucking in my stomach, doing half hearted workouts in the hot sticky weather and berating myself mentally for how chubby I felt I had become.I returned home with a new resolution to lose weight and met with a local trainer. I was so ready for change and desperate for help that I handed over my credit card and laced up my sneakers that day.Her program was rigorous and expensive. I found out later that it was designed for someone planning to enter a \u201cbikini model\u201d competition (which is not a goal on my bucket list). I exercised for two hours daily in the gym, lifting weights and slogging through cardio machine workouts. I was given a detailed plan that restricted calories to 1500 per day, composed of a specific ratio of protein, fat and carbohydrates (i.e. macros). Alcohol and sugar were forbidden.I was so exhausted and starving that I had to come home for naps in the afternoon and was in bed by 8 PM most nights. My career and social life suffered. The weight peeled off in the first few months, but I was miserable. I became obsessive, anxious and stressed about \u201cfollowing the program.\u201dAfter a few months with the trainer, I traveled to Greece for my cousin\u2019s wedding and loved the laid-back lifestyle. Meals are the focal point of the day, and no one is ever in a rush. My \u201cmeal plan\u201d included healthy fresh food such as fish, homemade bread, local fruit and vegetables, yogurt and a little wine. There was a bakery across the street from my Airbnb, and I began most mornings with an iced espresso and a giant Greek pastry.I walked several miles daily throughout the lovely hills of Mytilene, swam in the ocean and squeezed in a few push ups during my two-week sojourn. When I returned, I had not gained a pound, and it became clear that mind-numbing gym time and neurotic calorie counting were not conducive to long-term health or happiness.Since returning from Greece, my outlook on food and exercise has changed. I have lost a total of 30 pounds and kept it off. I am happy, healthy and no longer obsessed with the scale, which is truly a relief.My eating and fitness program is now based on the principle that there are no rules. Only a flexible set of guidelines, which are most effective when followed consistently.Guideline #1: Eat FreshAt the grocery store, I circle the aisles and hit the dairy, meat and produce sections, with detours for seltzer water and perhaps some \u201chealthy\u201d ice cream as needed (Halo Top, Yazo and Skinny Cow are all delicious). Take advantage of fresh seasonal produce and local fish, meat or poultry.Guideline #2: ProteinProtein fills me up and stabilizes my energy level. Hard boiled eggs, turkey jerky and Greek yogurt have become daily staples.Guideline #3: TreatsMy non-negotiable treat is a sweet pastry. I can skip salty snacks, alcohol and other splurges, but I have a fresh croissant or donut from my local bakery most days of the week.Guideline #4: Enjoy YourselfFood is a necessity, a pleasure and a privilege. Shopping for fresh food, and preparing healthy meals is my Zen time. I make time to eat slowly, without distractions, and linger over conversation with friends and family whenever possible.Guideline #5: Get MovingFind something you love and do it as many days of the week as possible. My go-to is yoga for the mind\/body component, and I take my dog for frequent walks on the beach with sprints mixed in. If I don\u2019t love it, I won\u2019t stick with it.Written byWritten by","12740":"On Saturday, April 27th, The New York Times exposed Apple\u2019s systematic removal of screen time applications from the App Store.Other major publications quickly picked up the story, leading Apple to share a public statement claiming these removals are justified on the grounds that parental control apps using MDM \u201cput users\u2019 privacy and security at risk.\u201d An email from Phil Shiller, SVP Worldwide Marketing, also stated Apple\u2019s position that these apps pose a risk to privacy.Unfortunately, Apple\u2019s statement is misleading and prevents a constructive conversation around the future of parental controls on iOS.We want to take the opportunity to set the record straight about MDM for our loyal users and the many families looking for solutions to guide healthy digital habits. Our hope is that Apple will work with developers in this space so that families continue to have a wide selection of parental controls to choose from.Shortly after the release of the iPhone in 2007, a growing body of research confirmed the negative impact of excessive screen time exposure for growing children and teens. In 2012, the OurPact team recognized the lack of solutions available on iOS and set out to develop comprehensive parental controls for families. We don\u2019t just develop OurPact, we use it in our own homes.From day one, our focus has been what\u2019s best for parents and their children. A core part of that mission is a commitment to data protection and user privacy \u2014 we never have and never will sell or provide any user data to any third party.Since its initial release, OurPact has employed a public, documented Apple technology known as MDM.While MDM was initially intended for company-owned or personally-owned BYOD implementations, it has also been used by many parental control applications to give parents more freedom to manage their children\u2019s mobile devices. In recent years, Apple has also extended MDM for use by children and teachers in schools.OurPact\u2019s core functionality would not be possible without the use of MDM; it is the only API available for the Apple platform that enables the remote management of applications and functions on children\u2019s devices. We have also been transparent about our use of this technology since the outset, and have documented its use in our submissions to the App Store.Apple recently stated that its own MDM technology, used by millions, poses risks to user privacy and can be abused by hackers. This stands in contradiction to the fact that MDM technology was initially developed by Apple to ensure security of private data on remotely managed devices. Apple alone issues certificates to third parties to communicate with their MDM servers, and Apple themselves are responsible for sending all MDM commands to user devices.We present here, point by point, Apple\u2019s recent claims in defense of removing apps that use MDM, to be contrasted with quotes from their own MDM documentation.Apple Press Statement: \u201cMDM gives a third party control and access over a device and its most sensitive information including user location, app use, email accounts, camera permissions, and browsing history.\u201dPhil Schiller: \u201cNo one, except you, should have unrestricted access to manage your child\u2019s device, know their location, track their app use, control their mail accounts, web surfing, camera use, network access, and even remotely erase their devices.\u201d\u2014 VS \u2014Apple\u2019s MDM Documentation:MDM cannot see personal data such as:To clarify this very important point: OurPact does not have access to any of this private information via MDM. It is impossible for us, hackers, or anybody else to obtain it. Apple is the only one who has access to and uses this data.Apple Press Statement: \u201cBusinesses will sometimes install MDM on enterprise devices to keep better control over proprietary data and hardware. But it is incredibly risky\u2026\u201dApple Press Statement: \u201cResearch has shown that MDM profiles could be used by hackers to gain access for malicious purposes.\u201dPhil Schiller: \u201cFurther, security research has shown that there is risk that MDM profiles could be used as a technology for hacker attacks by assisting them in installing apps for malicious purposes on users\u2019 devices\u201d\u2014 VS \u2014Apple\u2019s MDM Documentation:\u201cWhen users enroll in MDM for the first time on an iOS device, they are provided with information about what the MDM server can access on their devices and the features it will configure. This provides transparency to users about what is being managed, and establishes trust between you and the users.\u201d\u201cUsers understand how their devices are being managed and trust that their privacy is protected.\u201d\u201cWith a user-owned deployment, iOS [MDM] offers personalized setup by users and transparency around how devices are configured, along with the assurance that users\u2019 personal data won\u2019t be accessed\u2026\u201dApple Press Statement: \u201cParents shouldn\u2019t have to trade their fears of their children\u2019s device usage for risks to privacy and security, and the App Store should not be a platform to force this choice. No one, except you, should have unrestricted access to manage your child\u2019s device.\u201d\u2014 VS \u2014Apple\u2019s Support of MDM For Children in Practice:Apple allows 3rd party developers to create MDM applications for schools through their Apple Classroom program \u2014 they do not publish data on its usage, but likely hundreds of thousands (or more) children use devices with Apple MDM installed every day. These apps are not being pulled because of risk to privacy, in fact, Apple offers its MDM security as a major selling point to schools.OurPact collects only the data absolutely necessary to provide our service and we retain it for as short a period as possible. We comply with all global data protection laws, including GDPR.The most sensitive data OurPact collects is:Parents provide their child\u2019s name (or alternatively a nickname) to easily switch between their children\u2019s profiles within OurPact.Optionally, parents can specify their child\u2019s age and gender. Our team was actively developing an update to provide recommended daily screen time allowances and app recommendations for children, based on age.OurPact Premium displays a list of apps installed on child devices so that parents can manage access to each app individually. This list of applications is only visible to parents within their OurPact account.OurPact Premium uses iOS location data to help parents monitor their children\u2019s device location in real time.OurPact\u2019s location usage is in no way tied to MDM functionality. It operates in the same manner as all other family location apps on iOS. This data is only available if location permissions are explicitly enabled by the parent in both the parent application and within system settings on the child\u2019s device.To date, OurPact has been approved by Apple for release to the App Store 37 times, with documented use of MDM.In Apple\u2019s public statement, they claimed that they gave developers 30 days to modify their apps in line with their guidelines, even though their guidelines make no mention of MDM. We did not receive any notice before OurPact\u2019s child app was removed by Apple.More importantly, there is no way for any company offering a parental control app to remove MDM functionality and still have a viable product. If Apple offered alternate APIs to achieve the robust parental controls that OurPact provides we would happily use them. Unfortunately, no such API exists. All attempts to open a dialogue with Apple to create those APIs have also been refused.Apple is a company that we have great respect for, and their stance on privacy for their users is one we wholeheartedly agree with. It is why the majority of the OurPact team are iPhone users and many of us have been Apple users since the Apple II. So, by choice, we would never be in the unfortunate position of telling one of the most beloved companies in the world that they have made a mistake, but sometimes the truth has to be spoken to power.Given that there are no privacy issues with properly vetted MDM apps like OurPact being on the App Store, we humbly request that we are reinstated and allowed to continue providing our million users with the service they love and depend on.If Apple truly believes that parents should have tools to manage their children\u2019s device usage, and are committed to providing a competitive, innovative app ecosystem, then they will also provide open APIs for developers to utilize. Now, more than ever, the focus should be on building better and more diverse solutions for families to choose from.We remain committed to solving this problem, and we implore Apple to recognize they have a responsibility to support and encourage the growth of this industry.This issue will only be resolved if you voice your concern over the future of parental controls.If you care about this issue, let your voice be heard with these hashtags: #ThereUsedToBeAnAppForThat #SaveOurPact #GiveParentsControlWritten byWritten by","12761":"In the places around the world where people live the longest, they don\u2019t actually pursue health.They live longer because health ensues from the right environment.That is according to Dan Buettner, Blue Zones founder and National Geographic fellow, who has spent the last 15 years studying the five places around the world \u2014 dubbed Blue Zones \u2014 where people live the longest (into their 100s) and are healthiest: Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Ikaria, Greece; and Loma Linda, California.I had a chance to catch up with Buettner earlier this week, and he told me that in all five Blue Zones, people do not proactively exercise or seek health. Instead, physical activity just happens naturally as a result of their surroundings.In the Blue Zones \u2014 just like in the US \u2014 Buettner says people go to work, over to their friends\u2019 houses, out to eat, and get their kids off to school.But in the Blue Zones \u2014 unlike most places in America \u2014 those daily commutes all represent occasions to walk. Residents of the Blue Zones are also known to grow gardens in their yard, and their houses are not full of mechanical conveniences. All of this means that these longest-lived cultures have made a habit of moving naturally every single day. And they don\u2019t even think about it.Compare that to the US, where 73% of people say they need to be more active and over 60% describe their lifestyle as sedentary. We typically address this issue by urging people to hit the gym or sign up for a 5K. But focusing on individual responsibility does not drive behavior change at a population level, according to Buettner.\u201cIt is absolute delusion to think that we can convince 330 million Americans \u2014 three quarters of whom have already admitted they are not doing enough physical activity \u2014 to start exercising more,\u201d says Buettner. \u201cWe have been trying this for 70 years and we still have 70% of Americans who are obese or overweight. It is not working.\u201dHe acknowledges that a small percentage of people have the discipline and focus to stick with an exercise routine for 30 or 40 years to see the long-term health benefits. But for most Americans, Buettner believes the secret is living in an environment that empowers them to move mindlessly. \u201cI think the answer is designing our cities for human beings,\u201d he says.Unfortunately most American cities over the last 70 years have been designed only with cars in mind \u2014 with high speed limits and wide lanes for cars, but no sidewalks, bike lanes, or green spaces for people. As a result, people are driving more and walking less. Buettner points out over 50% of American children walked to school in 1970. Today that number is about 10%.There are, however, certain places in the US that are getting it right \u2014 Boulder, Colorado; San Luis Obispo, California; and Portland, Oregon, to name a few. In those locations, Buettner says people are measurably healthier with an extra 20 years of life expectancy over places like Tallahassee, Florida.Buettner and his team at Blue Zones have personally worked with dozens of US cities over the last decade to make them more walkable and bikeable. He points out that in almost every case, the BMI and obesity rate in those cities have dropped as a result.\u201cWe have hard evidence that when you optimize a city for walkability, bikeability, public transportation, and cleaned-up parks, you can raise the physical activity level of a whole population by up to 30%,\u201d says Buettner. \u201cThere is no gym, CrossFit, or exercise program that can get those types of results at a population level.\u201dThe key is stacking the deck in people\u2019s favor when it comes to movement \u2014 making the healthy choice the easy choice. To that end, Buettner and Blue Zones are now partnering with Degree Deodorant to create the Made To Move grant program that will provide half a million dollars in funding for city projects that promote increased physical movement. The partnership will fund pro-movement initiatives in five different US cities, such as repurposing vehicle lanes for active transportation, creating protected bike lanes, and improving local pedestrian environments. City officials and community organizations can apply for the grants on BlueZones.com. This is part of Degree\u2019s commitment to create movement opportunities, tools, and resources for 10 million people by 2024.All of this will help people get out from behind the steering wheel and onto their feet.\u201cIf you\u2019re walking more than about 45 minutes a day, you\u2019re getting 90% of the physical activity value of training for a marathon,\u201d says Buettner. \u201cSo when you are addressing populations, you want to make it easy for them.\u201dThat is exactly what happened in Buettner\u2019s hometown of Minneapolis, which made a commitment a decade ago to prioritize quality of life. Bike lanes were created, trees planted, and safe sidewalks added. As a result, Minneapolis was recently named the fittest city in America.Buettner and his team are now working towards a similar fate for cities all across the country.Written byWritten by","12841":"What we\u2019d all love to believe is that it is the person you are on the inside that counts the most. It shouldn\u2019t matter what you look like on the outside. I\u2019m speaking here on the issue of weight, not the color of your skin, your height, or your hair color. As a child, a Chinese immigrant growing up in a mostly white suburb of Toronto, I know how it feels to want to be white. But I\u2019m grown up now (mostly) and believe that we should accept ourselves and others no matter their weight. But let\u2019s live in the real world, because that\u2019s mostly just a dream.From a purely medical standpoint, many diseases are related to excess body fat. As part of the metabolic syndrome, it increases your risk of heart disease, stroke and cancer. Type 2 diabetes, closely related to increased body fat, is also the leading cause of blindness, kidney disease, non-traumatic amputations and infections. I treat many such cases as a medical specialist. And yes, in those cases, losing weight is likely the most important thing you can do to improve your health. A list of medically accepted weight loss benefits includes:But there are many people who are not overweight, as defined by Body Mass Index (BMI), and still metabolically unhealthy. And there are many people who are overweight (again, defined by BMI) and metabolically healthy. So, weight is not the entire story. Further, there are many other reasons why somebody should want to lose weight, other than the health benefits. One of the most important, although we all like to pretend otherwise is cold hard cash. Let\u2019s be clear. Thin people make more money.Weight discrimination creates a lot of unconscious bias. A lot. Many people unwittingly perceive overweight people as lazy, gluttonous, and lacking will power. This is the direct result of the \u2018Calories In, Calories Out\u2019 crowd, including most health professionals and researchers. Believing in the erroneous \u2018Energy Balance Equation\u2019, they imagine that weight loss is such a simple equation that everybody has the knowledge to lose weight. Therefore, the only missing piece is the willpower to follow through. That the obesity crisis is in reality a worldwide collective loss of willpower. Therefore, your excess weight is simply a manifestation of your underlying lack of willpower. Obesity, for them, is a character defect. For the \u2018A calorie is a calorie\u2019 crowd, obesity is not merely an increased weight, it is a direct measurement of your underlying strength of character. The idea that you just need to \u2018Eat Less and Move More\u2019 and that obesity is simply a lack of willpower is idiotic.This is also a highly dangerous concept. Consider the overweight person who comes to a health professional for advice on how to lose weight. \u201cEat less, move more\u201d they are told. But they don\u2019t lose weight. So, there are two possibilities:The second option is much more likely to be correct. Consider a teacher with 100 students. If one child fails, it may be the child\u2019s fault. Perhaps he or she did not study. Perhaps they were playing too many video games. But what if 70 children fail? Is it the children\u2019s fault, or more likely the teacher\u2019s fault? In America, 70% of adults are overweight or obese. Is the problem with the majority of Americans today, or is the problem with the dietary advice we\u2019ve been given?Indeed, since the advent of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 1977, consumption data from the United States Department of Agriculture shows that Americans have been indeed been doing exactly what they have been told to. Americans have eaten less meat and dairy and replaced their animal fats with vegetable oils. We\u2019ve eaten more grains, fruits and vegetables. What did we get for that? A tsunami of obesity the likes of which the world has never seen.And despite all the evidence, most all health professionals believe that option #1 is correct. This places the blame squarely on the advice taker, not the advice giver. Since health professionals are the advice givers, this is naturally their preferred explanation of why people don\u2019t lose weight with this puerile advice. It not their fault. It\u2019s yours. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that 99% of people who try the calorie restricted diet fail to lose weight over the long term. That every single study of this \u2018Eat Less, Move More\u2019 approach has failed. Every last one.Nevertheless, because of this prevailing view that obesity is a character failure, studies consistently find that obese individuals are viewed as less desirable subordinates, coworkers and bosses in the workplace They are perceived, erroneously as less agreeable and less emotionally stable. Mostly, people think they are lazy and lack self-discipline. This always struck me as slightly odd. Considering the lengths to which most people have gone to try to lose weight, \u2018lack of self-discipline\u2019 is one of the least accurate descriptions of most of the overweight people in my practice. Women, as is often the case, are judged more harshly than men. 60% of overweight women consider that they have been on the receiving end of weight discrimination compared to only 40% of men.To put it into concrete terms, look at the effect of weight on salary. Weight affects salary significantly, but the effect is different for men and woman. For women, the skinnier you are, the more money you\u2019ll make, even to a startling 70 pounds under the average weight. Women are punished for any weight gain, even above anorexic levels. For American women, a 25-pound weight gain produces an average decrease in salary of $15,572 per year. Very thin women earn approximately $22,000 more than an average weight woman. Very heavy women earn about $19,000 less than the average. The opposite holds true for men, who earn more the heavier they are.But both men and women who are obese face the \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 \u2014 a term usually applied to the invisible barrier towards career advancement of women, it applies equally to those who are heavy. There is an obvious discrimination against fat CEOs. In a study from 2009, only 4% of top male CEOs were obese (BMI> 30) compared to 36% of the general male population. But 61% of top male CEOs were overweight (BMI 25\u201329.9) indicating a level of tolerance for those who are only modestly heavier than the average.The situation for women is much starker. Only 3% of top female CEOs were obese compared to 38% of the general population. But only 22% of top female CEOs were overweight compared to 29% of the general population. Corporate America tolerates overweight men, but not women leaders. About 1\/3 of Americans are obese, and they almost never make it to the top of the corporate world.So, for all the talk that it\u2019s what inside that counts, let\u2019s be real for a second. Let\u2019s face the truth, despite the fact that it kind of sucks. The outside counts, too. Thin women make more money. Losing weight is good, not just for your health, but also for wealth.Written byWritten by","12854":"Happiness can be elusive.

As children we have needs that should be met to keep us safe and so that we can develop healthily.We have physiological needs such as food, clothing and shelter, but there are other needs required to shape our mind in a positive way. We have core emotional needs, such as love, connection and attention, which allow us to develop healthy views of ourselves and others.\u201cThe essential condition for healthy development is the child\u2019s relationship with nurturing adults.\u201c\u2014 Gabor Mat\u00e9When our core emotional needs are not sufficiently met in childhood, we adapt and develop a particular view of the world and of ourselves.These patterns we develop in our thinking and resulting behaviours are adaptive in childhood, but can become problematic in adulthood.Do you struggle to relax because you work so hard to do your best?Do you have feelings of inadequacy compared to people around you?Does it feel like there is something missing in your relationships?If patterns like these are prevalent in your life, there\u2019s a good chance they originated from your childhood experiences with parents, caretakers or other important people in your life.These deep-rooted negative life patterns don\u2019t have to be permanent.Broadly there are three steps to changing our negative life patterns.While the above may sound simple, the reality is that changing these negative life patterns is not easy. We all have an inner critic that can try to sabotage our efforts to understand ourselves better and mend what is broken.Many of us will require the help of a therapist to identify our negative life patterns, the core emotional needs which weren\u2019t met in childhood and walk us through the process of change.A therapy approach which provides a framework for understanding and changing these life patterns is schema therapy. In schema therapy a client will work with their therapist to explore the origins of their schemas (schemas are what we call negative life patterns in therapy). With an understanding of why the schemas developed, the emphasis is on working to heal them.The aim of schema therapy is to truly shift the way a person feels about themselves and others, not just to change the way that they think.To leave you with a final example of how these patterns can impact our everyday lives, consider the example provided by Dan Roberts in this article on the Abandonment schema:When Stephen was five his father \u2014 who he adored \u2014 suddenly left his mother and started a new family. Virtually overnight his dad went from an attachment figure that Stephen loved and relied on to being completely absent from his life. This clearly was an abandonment, so Stephen\u2019s schema developed then. He now gets fiercely jealous if his wife even speaks to other men \u2014 because his schema gets triggered and he is overwhelmed by a wave of jealousy, fear and insecurity.In schema therapy, we work on the Abandonment schema like every other \u2014 with a combination of experiential techniques (especially imagery and chair work) and \u2018limited reparenting\u2019, where we try to meet Stephen\u2019s core needs that did not get met in childhood. For both people, the biggest need I would be striving to meet would be love and a secure attachment \u2014 to me, primarily, but later to other friends, partners and family members. This takes time, but magically we can heal even the deepest, most painful schemas \u2014 and help people like this feel calmer, happier and more secure.If you have negative thinking and behavioural patterns impacting on your wellbeing and would like to know more about schema therapy I would encourage you to seek the assistance of a professional schema therapist. The International Society of Schema Therapy (ISST) has a \u2018Find a Therapist\u2019 search tool. You can also find out more about schema therapy and your personal patterns through an online self-education program I designed for schema therapy.As both a clinical psychologist and someone who has benefited from schema therapy in a personal capacity, I can see the help it provides my clients and also attest to it improving wellbeing through my lived experience.This is my first post on Medium.

From the second that the house lights dim, you can \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky \u2014 be swept away into a completely different world.Theatre is magic, and I love experiencing it from both the stage and the house. I know that it\u2019s not everybody\u2019s cup of tea, but I do wish people would give it a shot.One of the most common complaints that I hear is that It\u2019s so unrealistic, that people just randomly start singing and dancing out of nowhere. But one of the first things that I learned in my first musical theatre class is that it\u2019s not out of nowhere. There\u2019s a mantra: \u201cWhen your character feels too much for words to be enough, they sing; when they feel too much for song to be enough, they dance.\u201dAs someone who keeps their feelings relatively bound up (until I start ranting on the internet, but nevermind that), there\u2019s something freeing about giving in to the full depth of emotion: to immerse yourself in a world of people who openly express what\u2019s on their heart: whether it\u2019s pure joy, pain, or anything else on the multi-axial emotional spectrum.There is so much feeling tied into musicals. And, in feeling, there\u2019s freedom.Here\u2019re some of the songs I turn to when I\u2019m feeling blue.And you find some way to surviveAnd you find out you don\u2019t have to be happy at allTo be happy you\u2019re alive(I had to pick a clip starring the recently-departed Marin Mazzie, one of my favorite voices to grace Broadway.)Next to Normal was the musical that really brought me into the theatre world. For the first time, I was exposed to an art form that, while it wasn\u2019t necessarily representative if my mental illness, it painted a picture of somebody else\u2019s demons, so cruel and beautifully and perfectly. I could see myself in all of the main characters, as someone suffering from mental illness, and someone living with suffering with mental illness, as someone growing up with mental illness.It was important to have that, yes. But it was also one of the only hopeful mental illness stories that I was exposed to. Not a saccharine, happy ending with a cure, but hope.Next to Normal also taught me the joy of being a part of the theatre community \u2014 including a long-lived saltiness about your favorites not doing well on Tony night.I know, I know. It\u2019s been ten years, but still. Next to Normal deserved Best Musical along with that Pulitzer.Moving on.Then we stumble awayThrough dawn\u2019s blinding sun beamsBarely knowing right from rightNor left from wrongBut as long as we can hearThat little bluebirdThere\u2019ll be a songAs we stumble alongThe Drowsy Chaperone, for the uninitiated, is a musical within a musical, where a man, sitting alone at home, puts on a record of his favorite musical and it comes to life around him. Punctuated with his narration, this pastiche of an old-timey musical is made rip-roaring funny.And this humor has some teeth to it!But all of that aside, this song still manages to inspire and rekindle me when I\u2019m in my doldrums. (And the reprise of this song, which comes at the very end of the show, will always make me tear up. The man in the chair \u2014 as the narrator is called \u2014 starts singing the song to himself to cheer him up, and the characters come to life around him.)Suddenly I\u2019ve got an all female crewThe news talked, it made headlines across the worldSuddenly it stopped,No one saying \u201cYou can\u2019t\u201d or \u201cYou won\u2019t\u201dOr \u201cYou know you\u2019re not anything \u2019cause you\u2019re a girl\u201dI know that this song is definitely targeted as being an empowerment song for ladies, but the gender binary is shit and I love this song. It gets me going when I\u2019m down, and you can\u2019t ask for more than that.It\u2019s the kind of song where you want to shout and sing along, even if it\u2019s weird for you to.What makes this song even more amazing is that it\u2019s pretty much the biography of Capt. Beverley Bass, a trailblazing pilot who was among those grounded in Newfoundland after the 9\/11 attacks.Alabanza means to raise thisThing to God\u2019s faceAnd to sing, quite literally: \u201cPraise to this.\u201dBefore there was Hamilton, there was In the Heights \u2014 which will also be coming to a movie theatre near you, soon.This song is absolutely heartbreaking within the context of the show, but when you get to the latter half, and you just fall into listening to the round, to the harmonies that, while they break your heart, lift your wings.Some sadness isn\u2019t too bad, as long as it gives you wings.One choice, one chance, one road we takethe journey\u2019s never the aim.All the same, we change, we grow, we barely knowwho we\u2019ll become.If you\u2019ve spent any amount of time around me at all, you know how much I love Kait Kerrigan and Brian Lowdermilk. If not, I think this photo says it all.This song is from one of their musicals still in development, called Unbound. I think we\u2019ve only ever heard a couple songs from it, though I am definitely excited to see and hear more once they bring it completely to life.Until then, however, I am perfectly content to sink into this lovely song. This is applicable for so many walks, and an important reminder that I, impatient artist that I am, don\u2019t like having to remember.But I do need to remember. And it keeps me going when everything I do feels like a failure, and it would be so much easier for me to just give up on everything and settle down into a Netflix and Twitter and chill lifestyle.Something, perhaps, will come of all of this grief and struggle. Even if it does seem my time is running out.Written byWritten by","12981":"What you eat, drink and supplement with will have an immense impact on your skin. Only 15 percent of aging is caused by our genes while 85 percent is caused by our environment, including the environment we create with lifestyle choices such as diet, sleep, exercise and emotional stress.Aging is affected by factors such as the levels of antioxidants in our blood, exposure to environmental toxins like mercury and lead, insulin sensitivity (reflected in the amount of belly fat an individual carries), and our behavior towards stressful situations. These factors have the power to work for or against you. Fortunately, you can adjust how your genes are expressed in your DNA sequence.Ultimately, food is what determines the structure and integrity of the cells in our body, making \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d the literal truth.Your body will continue to produce collagen throughout your life, but the process begins to slow down with age and lack of maintenance. Modulating estrogen levels with lifestyle changes can slow down the loss of collagen. Improve your skin from the inside out by stimulating the body to make more collagen by filling micronutrient gaps such as essential fatty acids and vitamin C. In other words, to find real radiance, look to your plate.This article highlights key ways to help slow down the effects of aging to ensure that your diet is leaving you with a glowing complexion.Superfood Spotlight: EggsEggs are a great source of protein and o mega 3 essential fatty acids. They have powerful anti- inflammatory effects, improving the skins texture, suppleness and overall health. Omega-3 is necessary for healthy, supple skin and to repair the protective barrier that keeps moisture locked in. They also protect heart health, inhibit inflammation, bring balance to our hormones and support brain health.Consuming adequate amounts of omega-3 fatty acids reduces skin inflammation, which leads to improved fibroblast function and healthier collagen fibrils. The fibroblasts found in connective tissue, are responsible for making collagen, which is the primary structural protein in connective tissues and what lends elasticity to your skin and strength to your hair. Good fats also help maintain a healthy pH balance and reduce levels of prostaglandins \u2014 lipids that cause acute inflammation and constrict blood vessels \u2014 in the skin, thereby lessening inflammation and keeping your complexion radiant and clear.Find it in: The Energizing Sunshine SkilletHistory Lesson: GreensScientific research indicates that the daily inclusion of greens in your diet can heal inflammation, encourage the growth of good bacteria, assist in crowding out parasites, improve irritable bowel syndrome symptoms and allow you to glow from the inside out.Greens are rich in the antioxidant plant pigments called carotenoids, which enhance immune response and protect skin cells against UV radiation, and help the liver enzymes that neutralize carcinogens and other toxins. Their important antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects reduce the risk of heart disease and block sunlight-induced inflammation in the skin \u2014 which leads to wrinkles and skin cancer. The Vitamin A in these leafy greens also helps normalize the production of oil, while Vitamin C, Calcium and several other phytochemical\u2019s help add fibre into the diet making it one of the most powerful superfoods to consume.Find it in: The Beauty Blend SaladThe Beauty of Bone BrothBone broth is great for the gut because its nutrient dense and contains gelatin, which restores the strength of the gut lining, reduces inflammation and supports immune system function. The collagen present in bone broth helps form elastin within the skin, which is responsible for maintaining a youthful appearance by helping reduce wrinkles and other signs of aging.Find it in: The Golden HourThis article is for informational and educational purposes only.

I\u2019m sitting on the carpeted floor of my apartment in oversized sweatpants, a mug of tea to my right, the cool blue sky out the window to my left.Calm mornings like this are relatively new to me. They\u2019re a trademark of the sober lifestyle I chose one year ago today, and they \u2014 like so many of my new routines and simple pleasures \u2014 are sacred to me. Sobriety has reshaped my life in ways I never could have predicted.This journey that I assumed would be difficult, isolating, and painful has been replete with silver linings. My five-year relationship with drinking was the origin of many traumatic memories, painful injuries, toxic relationships, and though I didn\u2019t realize it then, my deepest wellspring of shame.And so after five years of drinking, I made the difficult decision to quit.My decision was predicated on months of reading, journaling, and wondering \u2014 wondering if my drinking was \u201cbad enough\u201d to warrant sobriety and wondering how hard it would be to quit. I was nervous at how my life would change. My mind was occupied with everything I\u2019d miss as a sober person, and I struggled to imagine how a sober life could be satisfying and enlivening \u2014 an intoxicant all on its own.When the benefits of sobriety began appearing \u2014 subtly at first, then rapidly, like a breaking dam \u2014 I realized that my life had become far more interesting than it was before. I also realized that choosing sobriety was the first genuine act of self-care I\u2019d ever taken. In the past, I\u2019d worked hard to achieve: to impress, to succeed, to earn. But I\u2019d made many of those choices robotically, following a ladder of success that wasn\u2019t necessarily a ladder to real fulfillment and joy.Becoming sober was the first choice I ever made to prioritize my health, wellness, and spirit. That\u2019s why sobriety honestly feels like my greatest achievement. I\u2019m proud of it, right to my bones.But it hasn\u2019t been easy. Coincidentally, this past year has been my most challenging to date, overflowing with difficult transitions, shattering heartbreak, and black whirlpools of anxiety. It has been extraordinarily hard for me. However, difficulties notwithstanding \u2014 difficulties included \u2014 this has been the most rewarding year of my life so far. I feel more aligned with my authentic self than ever, and I attribute that process of alignment entirely to my decision to become sober.This is not a testament to the Sober Experience at large. It\u2019s my first-hand experience of the fact that nature abhors a vacuum, and when you remove alcohol, you also add the unexpected. For me, sobriety launched an avalanche of life-changing revelations.It opened my eyes to the many ways we use numbing agents to create barriers between ourselves and the raw, uncomfortable, potent experiences of living in this world.What began as a commitment to avoid hangovers became a commitment to getting in touch with my heart, a commitment to living in the present moment in spite of discomfort, and a commitment to experiences and people that make me feel fundamentally nourished and safe.The way I see it, we\u2019re not incentivized to kick an addiction until we begin to believe in a brighter alternative \u2014 an alternative that feels more inspiring and satisfying than the addiction. When I quit drinking, I knew that if I was going to permanently resist the buzz of booze, I needed a compelling alternative waiting in the wings.When I was drinking, my hangovers were consistent and totally debilitating; a drunken night meant a bedridden tomorrow. The more I drank, the warier I grew of my early-morning commitments. In retrospect, I\u2019m bummed to remember all of the college brunches I skipped, all of the mornings I could have spent soaking in the changing seasons.Now that I\u2019m hangover-free, I have my mornings back. And they\u2019re priceless. When I wake up, I get real joy out of seeing the sun spill onto my bed, brewing my coffee, and sitting down with my journal for an hour. This calm, quiet time was virtually non-existent in my drinking life. Now I begin every day with a quiet reflection that eases me into the day.When I was drinking, I didn\u2019t feel like I had the power to avoid danger. I never knew where the night would lead or what state I\u2019d be in the following morning. As a result, my life as a whole felt out of control; I didn\u2019t feel like I could trust myself to make healthy choices.Now that I\u2019m sober, I view my life as a jar. And I only fill that jar with exactly what I want. I only let in people and experiences that make me feel safe.Reclaiming control over my safety (to the extent that I am able) has been critical in restoring my self-love. Bars and clubs no longer feel fundamentally sinister, tainted with the ghosts of the reckless experiences I\u2019ve had there. In reclaiming my sense of safety, I\u2019ve also cultivated a deep sense of self-trust.When I quit drinking, my greatest concern was that my social life would suffer. I\u2019m surprised and happy to share that one year later, I have the most soulful circle of friends I\u2019ve ever had.Instead of wasting precious weekends having half-remembered chats with drinking friends, I now only hang with people I find genuinely fun and interesting. I\u2019ve discovered a community of spiritual seekers who are committed to living as presently as possible, and I can already tell that this community will be the foundation of lifelong friendships.Without alcohol as a social lubricant, I have a lower tolerance for crowded bars and eardrum-shattering music. Instead, I go on moonlit walks, make pumpkin soup, have potlucks with my friends, build bonfires, watch scary movie marathons, and go to Dharma talks.Sobriety has diversified my recreational outlets and my life is richer for it. In the spirit of living a less-numb life, I also began meditating and the rumors are true; it helps regulate my anxiety and gives me a chance to exist without attempting to maniacally control the course of my days. While meditating, I\u2019ve had some inexplicably profound moments \u2014 moments when I\u2019ve felt entirely peaceful, at home, like I could die tomorrow having experienced what makes life so precious.I\u2019ll keep this one simple: I\u2019m only intimate with people I want to be intimate with sober. It feels vulnerable to share this, but my story would be incomplete without it. This has been one of the most important pieces of my sobriety because it has enabled me to rediscover a gut-sense of safety, self-worth, and self-respect. It has also enabled me to experience the profound connectedness and beautiful vulnerability of sharing bodies with a partner and being fully present for every moment.I spent an average of $31.50 a week on booze (even that\u2019s low \u2014 I\u2019m frugal), which means I saved $1,606 this year. Now I have the budget for activities that feel good and are actually good for me, like getting massages, taking yoga classes, and going on Amazon book-buying splurges.Unsurprisingly, without alcohol, my body feels worlds healthier. I have more energy, my skin is clearer, my restless legs have all but disappeared, and I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a headache or felt nauseous.Without alcohol, I\u2019ve been forced to develop real coping skills to handle emotional difficulty. This development hasn\u2019t been fun, exactly, but it has been transformative. In sobriety, I went through a deeply painful breakup that put me through a physical, emotional, and spiritual wringer. It hurt more than anything I\u2019d ever felt before, and the hurt lasted longer than I thought hurt could last.And then \u2014 gratefully \u2014 I came out the other end, proving to myself that I was resilient and capable of moving through grief and pain. I\u2019m experiencing life in all its rawness and beauty. Like Mark Nepo, poet and spiritual thinker, so aptly says:\u201cFor only when we can outwait the dark will the sharpness of experience recede like a tide to reveal what has survived beneath it all. Often what seems tragic, if looked at long enough, reveals itself as part of a larger transformation.\u201dAs a sober person, I have more control over my reactivity. The witching hour is no longer a breeding ground for illogical arguments with drunken friends and strangers. When I do argue with others, I do so mindfully, consciously. My memories of disagreements are fully intact and I don\u2019t spend hours the following day guiltily wondering what I said or whether my drunkenness was to blame.My first New Year\u2019s Eve without a drink, I dreaded the moment I\u2019d be the only party-goer without a sunrise-yellow glass of champagne. My first vacation in the Caribbean without a legit Pi\u00f1a Colada felt lackluster \u2014 incomplete. I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I was missing out. But eventually I realized that what made special occasions special wasn\u2019t the romanticized booze in the glass, but the pomp and circumstance; the togetherness; the novelty of a celebratory day.Over time, I began to spend holidays, gatherings, and parties focusing on the interactions and traditions that made the day unique. Now, instead of having a vague, foggy recollection of the night before, I\u2019m present for special occasions and feel the warm, loving glow that comes from being in communion, and celebrating with, people I love.I miss drinking sometimes. When I go out dancing at the local bar on Thursday nights, I miss detoxing from the workweek with my hand around a Smuttynose. I miss knocking back whiskey shots with my friends at the Cape as we play guitar around a blazing bonfire.But it\u2019s an incomplete nostalgia, this craving for alcohol I feel from time to time. Because when I \u201cplay the movie to the end,\u201d as they say, the closing scenes are not so pretty. Whenever I catch myself in a boozy reverie, I gently remind myself to include the consequences.And when I compare the two \u2014 the tumultuous drinking days and my sober present \u2014 sobriety wins, hands down, every time.Written byWritten by","13137":"Normal people just don\u2019t understand depression.When they love you, they try to, and that means the world. As someone who grew up in a home where words like crazy and psycho were punch lines, and depression and therapy were all but untouchable, being around people who provide actual, real support makes all of the difference in the world.But when you sit down with somebody who\u2019s normal and try to explain the specifics of what\u2019s giving you trouble, it feels like I\u2019m speaking in a completely different language. There\u2019s this huge divide of understanding that becomes incredibly frustrating.In their language, it sounds like I\u2019m saying that I don\u2019t want to do something that\u2019s incredibly simple just because I don\u2019t want to; I\u2019m trying to use the same words to explain how what they perceive as a simple task is, in fact, something that\u2019s immensely difficult and draining.Trying to communicate is do, but there\u2019s something in this fundamental divide that makes it feel almost futile. There\u2019s no way for me to explain what\u2019s going on without sounding like a fundamentally lazy and worthless person; there\u2019s no way for them to offer suggestions or help. Even with good intentions on both sides, there\u2019s a gap.I\u2019ve spent a lot of time in my head trying to develop a metaphor for how I feel.One of the most well-known metaphors is that of \u201cspoons\u201d \u2014 but even outside of the Spoonie community, there aren\u2019t a lot of people who really understand what that\u2019s all about. It ends up sounding like one of those new weird newfangled labels that \u201cnormal\u201d people roll their eyes at.So I wrack myself for a metaphor.The best one that I have now is that I am a cell phone, where there\u2019s either something wrong with the charging port or the battery, that doesn\u2019t let me recharge normally.I picture normal people as being like your average cell phone \u2014 you can plug it in and use it and it\u2019ll still charge fairly well. If you leave it on, but don\u2019t use it, it\u2019ll charge it faster. If you turn it off, it\u2019ll charge even faster, and be ready to go.I\u2019m more like a damaged phone that can\u2019t hold on to a charge at all. If you plug me in and keep using me, the battery is still going to keep going down, albeit more slowly than if I wasn\u2019t plugged in. If you turn me completely off, I\u2019ll recharge more quickly, but that doesn\u2019t undo the brokenness: as long as I\u2019m gone, the battery life will hemorrhage away.If your phone was like that, how would you use it differently? (and don\u2019t say that you would replace it \u2014 well, people like me, we\u2019re used to being replaced, but still). How would having that defective phone change the way you use your phone?For me, it means you don\u2019t pull out your phone for every little thing. It means that you\u2019ve got to budget your app use.There are some background apps that I can\u2019t turn off, no matter how much I want to. The anxiety, the depression, the worry, the constant fear of running out of money, the constant fear of getting older and not having any kind of life worth living or safety plan, they\u2019re there. If the phone is on, they\u2019re running; they\u2019re taking their toll on the battery.So every time I do something, I have to judge: what kind of toll is this going to have on the battery? Is this going to cost me more energy than I currently have? Is using this app, is doing this thing, worth the energy cost? Is it going to leave me feeling hollow, exhausted, worthless?Every phone call, every text, every notification, every app, every little element of life has its own cost. And I have to decide which ones I\u2019m going to bother with.And how do you save that energy? You find that the safest thing to do is to make yourself perfectly numb. Emotional Novocain. Find someway to numb yourself and let the time pass. You keep the phone plugged in, but you never check it. Never use it. Never try to do anything.Eventually, the phone will stop working. Eventually, the battery will refuse to hold a charge, or something will short, and the entire thing will crap out on you. But the goal is to keep the phone alive and working for as long as possible.So what if you can\u2019t use it for anything worth a damn?This metaphor is imperfect. Painfully imperfect, deficient in so many ways. It has so many holes in it. So many flaws. So many nuances that it doesn\u2019t cover.I just want people to understand. There\u2019s a part of me that thinks that, if I could get people to understand this depression, this monster, this mess, this chronic exhaustion, this defeat, this hopelessness, this fatigue that never ends, that never gets better, that just keeps stretching out forever and ever and ever and ever, I\u2019d\u2019ve done something worthwhile with my life.And, perhaps, if I can get them to understand, they will forgive me for my brokenness. Forgive me for the multiple, myriad ways that I have failed them. Not because I wanted to, not because I didn\u2019t care, but because when they needed me, I couldn\u2019t hold a charge.Written byWritten by","13151":"Content note: descriptions of mental illness.A while back, I went through a really hard time in my life. I felt isolated from my friends, who were pulling away from me; I was in a long-distance relationship with a partner who was terrible at communication; I was under the tremendous amount of pressure of finishing exams at an elite university.I wasn\u2019t at my best. I was a burden on one of my friends, who wasn\u2019t really prepared to be my therapist, but who did her best. I lashed out at my partner and was quick to anger at the smallest things he did wrong. I chose to stay away from the people I\u2019d formed the strongest relationships with, choosing to believe they found me intolerable. I stopped finding joy and comfort in the things I used to love.I drank more than I should, I slept less than I should, I alternated between running obsessively and eating unhealthily.In short, my mental health was shot. I was spiraling, quickly and uncontrollably, and nobody knew how to help me.The worst part? Some of them tried.I think, looking back, that a lot of people knew I was struggling. One of my friends, to whom I confessed my feelings of paranoia and inadequacy, would try to comfort me by telling me that what I was saying was foolish. Of course, my friends didn\u2019t secretly hate me. Of course, there wasn\u2019t a conspiracy to exclude me from social events.It didn\u2019t help.In the depths of my mind, all that convinced me of was that she was in on it, that she resented me, that she wanted to trick me, too. Telling me that I was being silly or foolish or just wrong was unhelpful.At best, all it would do was cement my belief that I was being weak by letting myself believe these silly things. At worst, it deepened my downwards spiral without helping at all.Frankly, I was not stronger than that. I suffered a lot from something that was mostly out of my control. And what galled me the most was the implication that I was weak, somehow, for letting myself fall prey to these thoughts, these feelings.When I was able to switch \u201con,\u201d I could act like my normal, vivacious, bright and bubbly self. When I could find the energy to bring myself up, I laughed, smiled, joked and bantered with the best of them.So when I let the facade slide, it concerned those who were present to see it happen. And I think they thought, if I could just hold on for a bit longer, keep the illusion real for a few moments or hours or days more, then I\u2019d be OK forever.And their solution? Buck up. Stop giving in to the monster under the bed, and simply find the strength to perform \u201chappy\u201d all the time. They couldn\u2019t understand how sometimes I could and sometimes I couldn\u2019t, and they were uncomfortable with the idea.File this in with suggesting exercise and smiling more.I\u2019ve read all the same articles you have, how sunshine and fresh air and exercise and endorphins can make you feel better. And sometimes, I could bring myself to do those things. But most times, I couldn\u2019t.It was inconceivable to some of my friends that I would choose to sit inside in my room, not talk to anyone, and spend my evening scrolling through Twitter in the dark until it was time to go to sleep. People could not understand why I wouldn\u2019t do the things that would make me better.To them, I was an irresponsible mentally unwell person. A good depressive would have taken care of themselves. A bad one, like me, clearly didn\u2019t care about improving and just wanted to continue wallowing in self-pity for as long as possible.That was the implication when I tried to explain that sometimes I could not bring myself to get outside, that forcing myself to smile when I felt like crying was not a feasible answer.This, to me, is synonymous with \u201cthink positive!\u201dImagine that you\u2019re at the bottom of a very deep, very dark pool of water. You know, theoretically, that there\u2019s a surface. You know, theoretically, that with enough effort and work you might get there one day.Now imagine someone just says that one day, you\u2019ll get there, with no allusion to the monumental effort it would take. There\u2019s no reference to the hardship you\u2019re suffering now. Wouldn\u2019t it still feel hopeless? Wouldn\u2019t it still feel as though it wasn\u2019t true?The fact was, way too many people tried to comfort me, or snap me out of it. And honestly, there was no comforting me. There was no right thing that would magically make me OK again.When I revealed I was having a hard time, they thought their duty was to cheer me up. And it sucked when they tried and inevitably failed.What was worse, was that some people took it really personally when their foolproof cheer-up plans didn\u2019t work on me and reverted back to implying it was my fault for not pulling myself together (with their conveniently-offered help).The best thing you can say is actually nothing at all. Instead, listen. Be there when they need you, not when they ask, because by the time they ask, they will have needed you for a long, long time.Be honest and tell them to go get professional help, if it\u2019s beyond you. Tell them they\u2019re not weak. Remind them that mental illness needs to be looked after by professionals, like any other.And, because every person is different and has individual needs, ask them what they need from you. Go out and offer yourself, anything you can do. If it\u2019s to not mention work, or to not ask \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d or to stop making jokes about anything, don\u2019t ask why.My bad mental health didn\u2019t look like pictures of #depression. I was angry, bewildered, confused, and unstable more than I was sad. The people I had counted on for years let me down in the end, because my mental health made them uncomfortable and they didn\u2019t know how to cope.To the people who are reading this, you probably have a friend or several who are struggling, whether they\u2019ve revealed it to you or not. Watch out for the signs, offer help where it\u2019s needed, and stop telling people to cheer up.Want my four-day email course to start making money on Medium?

I demur on this: one size \u2014 with a few personalized tweaks here and there \u2014 really does fit all. That may not be a popular stance, but I shall now set out the case for the defence.Throughout evolution many species of humans have roamed this globe, often coexisting. How strange it must have been, to occasionally encounter those \u201cothers.\u201d But today we are alone, the last remaining species belonging to the Homo genus, which emerged over two million years ago. Sapiens is literally the last Homo standing.When in 2003 the mapping of the human genome was completed, the heartening discovery was made that we are all related to each other. We modern humans can trace our origins to East Africa, our ancestral homeland. That is where Homo sapiens appeared, 200,000\u2013300,000 years ago. We began to move into Asia something like 50,000\u201380,000 years ago. Before you knew it, we were everywhere, and doing a remarkable job of adapting and surviving.The genes we carry today were determined in Africa. We are little changed since the end of the Paleolithic era, which represents 99.5% of human history. Our ancient genome has an average mutation rate of 0.5% per million years, meaning it \u201cstill resides for the greater part in the Paleolithic era.\u201dAnd so to food, and what to eat.In order to answer that, we need to understand the \u201cnutritional milieu\u201d in which the genetic make-up of H. sapiens was established.That is not to say that we should all be eating what is often referred to as the \u201cPaleo\u201d diet. Essentially, there is no such thing. Much of our success as a species can be ascribed to our adaptability to whatever environment we settled in as we migrated away from our original homeland. The menu varied wildly.The out-of-Africa exodus occurred primarily along coastlines and rivers, and from lake to lake across North Africa. Consequently, anatomically modern humans regularly consumed fish and shellfish, high in protein and providing the micronutrients that are crucial for brain growth and development, including the fatty acid DHA, iodine and vitamins D and B12.Meat was a dietary staple, especially for those who migrated further inland, providing high quality protein and fat, and highly bioavailable minerals, including iron and zinc. Skeletal analysis \u2014 the study of fossil isotopes \u2014 makes evident that \u201c..even very early hominids consumed a considerable proportion of meat in their diets.\u201dThe further north of the equator humans travelled, the less plant food was consumed, as it became less available.Whatever their environment, all wild animals eat in accordance with the practice of \u201coptimal foraging\u201d. Optimal foraging is a behaviour whereby energy (calories) obtained from food must be greater than the amount of energy expended procuring that food.Optimal foraging is about efficiency. You can\u2019t spend all day, and all your energy, gathering a few leafy greens and berries when you have a hungry tribe back at camp to feed. Even today, hunter-gatherers show a strong preference for animal-based foods over plant-based foods, even when living in vegetation-rich environments.That would also explain the attraction of junk food: lots of filling calories for little expenditure. It fits the paradigm of modern optimal foraging perfectly.In 1987, scientist and author Jared Diamond published his now famous article in Discover magazine, entitled The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race. He was talking about the first Agricultural Revolution that began around 10,000 years ago, when sapiens transitioned from a hunter-gathering to a settled, farming lifestyle. In his article he states:\u201cIn particular, recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of agriculture, supposedly our most decisive step toward a better life, was in many ways a catastrophe from which we have never recovered.\u201dAgriculture changed the course of history, arguably more than any other human-driven event. The Neolithic era was characterised by a (gradual) switch from a highly varied, meat-based diet to a monotonous, cereal-based diet. A typical farmer\u2019s diet in Neolithic Europe consisted mostly of bread made from wheat or other grains like rye and barley, supplemented with peas and lentils, milk and cheese, some occasional meat, and seasonal fruits.The transition from a meat-based to a cereal-based diet resulted in numerous detrimental health effects, including reduction in stature, increase in infant mortality, reduction in lifespan, increase in iron deficiency anaemia, dental decay and bone mineral disorders, including osteomalacia.Much-reduced protein consumption was a major feature of the Neolithic and contributed to a process called gracilization (thinning) of the skeleton. Pre-agricultural people had much greater bone density than we do today.The Agricultural Revolution was one thing. Then came the Industrial Revolution, thousands of years later, but just seven or eight generations ago.The Industrial Revolution gave rise to a completely new source of human nutrition: the processed food industry.Since the start of the twentieth century, sugar consumption has rocketed, as has vegetable oil consumption, having largely replaced the animal fats traditionally used as a cooking medium. These novel vegetable oils are ubiquitous in processed foods. They are rich in omega-6 fatty acids that compete with, and displace, omega-3 fats (DHA) in the brain. Fish is the major source of DHA, and fish consumption has plummeted to levels well below the recommended amount in both the UK and the US.As this extraordinary nutrition transition permeated the twentieth century, so too did its running mate, the disease transition.Until the early 20th century, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis were the main cause of death following the post Neolithic era. By the mid 20th century, chronic diseases (diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cancer) had emerged as the number one threat to global health. Mental illnesses have increased in line with physical chronic diseases since 1960.There has also been a transition in the advice we are expected to follow. Instead of consuming the diet that humans ate throughout evolution, experts now tell us to avoid or cut down on meat and saturated fats such as butter, and switch to those new, refined vegetable oils and cereal grains.The 2017 U.S. Department of Agriculture report, US Trends in Food Availability, reveals that Americans have complied well with official dietary guidelines. Between 1970 and 2014, red meat consumption decreased by 28%, with overall saturated fat consumption down 27%. At the same time, vegetable cooking oil consumption rose by a staggering 248%. Consumption of grains, in the form of wheat flour, rice, corn, oats and barley, increased by 28%. Americans still consume 83% more than the recommended limit of 12.5 teaspoons of sugar per day.Along with chronic diseases, something else is starting to surface, something less visible but arguably more sinister. The human brain is shrinking, as confirmed by a body of research that has been accumulating since 1988. This shrinkage \u2014 atrophy \u2014 began during the Epipaleolithic period, which was the transitional period between hunter-gathering and agriculture, and remains an ongoing phenomenon. Over the last 20,000 years, average brain size has decreased by 10%. What\u2019s even more alarming is that the last 4,000\u20136,000 years have witnessed an acceleration of this atrophy.Various theories have been proposed to explain this startling development, but no one cause has been established. I would hazard a guess that diet is involved.If we assume that our current dietary habits are killing us, it surely makes scientific sense to take a close look at the overall health and diets of modern tribal peoples whose lifestyles remain largely uninfluenced by the western world.Their way of life is under threat, which means we are all under threat. According to Survival International, the global organization that advocates on behalf of tribal peoples, \u201c\u2026tribal peoples are better at looking after their environment than anyone else.\u201d\u201cUncontacted peoples are supreme conservationists with the lightest footprint on our planet, and they protect some of the world\u2019s last and most biodiverse forests. They have developed extraordinary skills and have unrivalled knowledge of their universe.\u201d (Fiona Watson, Survival International)We can learn from tribal peoples, but we need to be quick; most today are in transition between their traditional lifestyles and modern living.Hair and blood analyses have shown that before the 1960s, the nutritional status of various tribal peoples (the !Kung, the Aka of the Central African Republic, aboriginal Australians and the northern European Sami) were within healthy ranges.Approximately 15 years later, following settlement, these people had started to experience high rates of iron deficiency anaemia. Post-transition deficiencies in folate, iron, vitamins A, E and B12 were also observed, alongside an increase in diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular risk and cancer.The nutrition transition phenomenon works in reverse. A paper published in 2009 in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition detailed a small study that investigated the effect of a diet, similar to that consumed by preagricultural hunter-gatherers, on sedentary, slight overweight adult Americans. After following the diet for just ten days, all the volunteers experienced dramatic improvements in health markers, including \u201csignificant reductions\u201d in blood pressure, improved arterial flexibility, improved insulin sensitivity, and lower blood fat levels. The diet consisted of lean meats, vegetables, fruits and nuts, and excluded cereals, dairy and legumes.\u201cConsiderable evidence suggests that many common diseases can be prevented by hunter-gatherer diets.\u201d (Lindeberg 2009)In 1985, anthropologists S Boyd Eaton and Melvin J Konner proposed their \u201cdiscordance hypothesis\u201d, which states that the human genome is determined by the conditions of the Paleolithic era, and that changes have occurred too rapidly for us to adapt, resulting in a mismatch that leads to chronic disease.\u201cThe physical activity, sleep, sun exposure, and dietary needs of every living organism (including humans) are genetically determined. This is why it is being increasingly recognized in the scientific literature, especially after Eaton and Konner\u2019s seminal publication in 1985, that the profound changes in diet and lifestyle that occurred after the Neolithic Revolution (and more so after the Industrial Revolution and the Modern Age) are too recent on an evolutionary time scale for the human genome to have fully adapted.\u201d (Carrera Bastos et al)There is no one diet that characterises pre-agricultural humans, who ate from a fabulously broad menu, according to geographical location. However, there were commonalities. These include:\u00b7High wild meat\/fish intake with a preference for fatty prey\u00b7 Rare consumption of cereal grains\u00b7 No added sugar\u00b7 No refined vegetable oils\u00b7 Extensive range of wild plant foods, where available.We cannot go back to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle \u2014 there are way too many of us, and in any case we lack the skills to do so. And who would choose to? But if some cataclysmic event (which may be coming) left us with no choice, we in the post-industrial world would not survive for long. We really do need to learn some ancient skills from tribal peoples.The catch-22 dilemma is that neither can we continue to consume a diet that is making us sick, shrinking our brains and shortening our lives. We need to eat in a way that most closely resembles the diet on which we evolved. And is realistic.There are several popular diets that fit this paradigm: the ketogenic diet, the Paleo diet, the Atkins diet, the ancestral diet, the low GI (glycaemic index) diet. Perhaps you could add a few more. Like the pre-agricultural diet of humans living all around the globe, these diets have their differences and their similarities. Paleo adherents don\u2019t eat dairy foods, because they are a product of agriculture, and a recent addition to the human diet. Ketogenic fans love dairy foods, because they are so full of saturated fat.But whatever their differences, all these diets are based on a low carbohydrate, high fat and\/or protein way of eating, without sugary snacks and other processed \u201cfood\u201d. And they are all as close as we can realistically get to the pre-agricultural diets of our ancestors, the one to which we are genetically adapted.We Homo sapiens all require exactly the same nutrients, the same ones we\u2019ve always needed. How much depends on age, level of physical activity, exposure to sunlight, geographical location, and so on. Some people have allergies or sensitivities to certain foods that they need to avoid. But nobody needs sugar, cereal grasses, vegetable oils et al.As members of the Homo sapiens species, we all thrive on the same range of foods. You could call it the human diet.Our technologically-driven, industry-centric lifestyles have left the vast majority of the global population so disconnected from the natural world that we can no longer see or understand our place within it. We live and think outside our natural context, and even accept absurd claims, such as fake meat substitutes, assembled in laboratories and factories, being healthier than the real thing. We choose foods that are nutrient-poor, and then buy factory-produced supplements to compensate for the shortfall.You can change your diet as often as you like, and your food-based ideology. But you cannot change human evolutionary biology. One, broad-ranging size really does fit all.Written byWritten by","13254":"The liver is the largest and one of the most important organs in the body. A few of its main functions are (a) Metabolic \u2014 glucose homeostasis, (b) Synthetic \u2014 interconversion of nutrients, binding protein for iron, copper and vitamin A, \u00a9 Storage \u2014 of vitamins and minerals, glycogen, and lipids, (d) Catabolic \u2014 detoxification, phagocytosis [bacterial metabolism], hormones, synthesis of blood components, (e) Excretory \u2014 bile production (Regan, J., et al. 2011) (Marieb, E.N. 2012).One of the roles of the liver is detoxification. Substances ingested or produced by the body (a by-product of metabolism) will eventually get filtered through the liver. There are two phases of detoxification; Phase I and Phase II.In Phase I the body draws in stored fat-soluble toxins from the body\u2019s tissues. These toxins enter the body (via food \u2014 mouth \u2014 the nose or the skin) and if allowed to pass the barrier of the intestine make their way into our bloodstream. They are the last thing you would ever want to be floating around in the cardiovascular system, therefore they have stocked away in fat, nerves, brain and kidney tissues etc. until they can be properly and safely disposed of.Phase II takes these toxins and prepares them for their exit from the body; a water molecule is added to each fat-soluble chemical allowing them to depart the body safely.Phase IDetoxifies drugs such as; codeine, warfarin, prednisone, steroids and alcohol. In order for these toxins to be cleared out the following nutrients are required; copper, magnesium, zinc, vitamin C, molybdenum, antioxidants & bioflavonoids.Foods and other things that turn on Phase 1 (Activators)Broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, caraway, dill seeds, oranges, tangerines, vitamin B1, niacin, vitamin C, charbroiled meats, alcohol, nicotine, some drugs, chemicals, dioxin, pesticides.Foods and other things that turn off Phase 1 (Inhibitors)Drugs including antihistamines, stomach acid blockers, ketoconazole, naringenin (from grapefruit juice), turmeric, green tea, red chilli pepper, clove oil, onions (quercetin), calendula, milk thistle, ageing, hypothyroid, toxins from inappropriate intestinal bacteria.The liver must function in a balance if Phase 1 is functioning either to quickly or too slowly its detox potential will not be there and instead of filtering chemicals out of the body they will be re-imbed into the body\u2019s cells. To assess is Phase 1 is functioning optimally try a caffeine clearance test.Phase IIPhase II is the second part of Liver detoxification. Detoxifies drugs such as; acetaminophen, nicotine, caffeine, pesticides, epoxides, aspirin and benzoates. In order for these toxins to be cleared out the following nutrients are required; glutathione, vitamin B6, glycine, SAMe, methyl groups, molybdenum, cysteine, acetyl CoA and others.Foods and other things that turn on Phase 2 (Activators)Brassica family foods, limonene (found in the peel of citrus fruits, as well as herbs dill and caraway), glycine, methyl donators, taurine and fish oils, birth control pill and some drugs.Foods and other things that turn off Phase 2 (Inhibitorsos)A deficiency of glutathione, folic acid, Vitamin B1. B2, B5 and B12, selenium or zinc. A diet low in protein, aspirin,The liver will do its best to break down toxic substances into less toxic forms that can be easily eliminated from the body, however for those that cannot be they are stored in the liver and in other tissues throughout the body. If one of the phases of detoxification is working either too quickly or too slowly due to deficiencies in nutrients, an imbalanced diet or a high intake of medication many of the toxins that enter the body will not be cleaned out properly.If Phase I is moving too quickly and Phase II is working too slowly or as it should, it will not be able to keep up with the demand of Phase I and some toxins may be let into the body, the same can occur if Phase II is working faster than Phase I, as it may not process chemicals as effectively. To learn how to tell if one of your liver detox Phases is out of balance, to a Caffeine Clearance Test.It is said that life depends upon the liver! Your liver does many functions like storing nutrients, cleansing the blood and managing the cholesterol. This makes it very important for the overall health of the body. Fortunately, there are some foods for healthy liver which will help you keep it fit. These foods should help the liver in the detoxification process and should be rich in antioxidants.Include foods which have ample amount of magnesium, folate, iron, flavonoids, vitamins etc. These will help the liver in detoxification. Any deficiency in the nutrients will slow down the process. Some foods that promote a healthy liver are dark leafy greens and bitters. Antioxidants will help in stopping tissue damage and will assist the liver in detoxification. Some recommended sources of antioxidants are cabbage, black raspberries, turmeric and spirulina.An unhealthy liver can lead to fatigue, headaches, allergies, bad breath, skin problems and weight gain. Therefore, take care of it by having foods for healthy liver and following a healthy lifestyle. Below is a list of foods that aid in improving liver health and function.Some common cruciferous vegetables are broccoli, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, cabbage etc. They are strong detoxifiers of our liver. These vegetables contain certain chemicals which neutralize toxins. They also help in the production of enzymes needed for detoxification.Beetroot should be included in the diet for a healthy liver. It has blood-purifying properties to clean the blood. Beets can also absorb heavy metals from the blood.Garlic has allicin which is needed for detoxification by the liver. It helps the liver to get rid of the mercury, estrogen and food additives.Apple has pectin which binds itself to the heavy metal and helps in their excretion. This reduces the burden on the liver.Lemon juice provides a large quantity of vitamin C and vitamin C is a very important nutrient which strengthens the liver. Vitamin C is known for its antioxidant property which deals with a variety of effects. Lemon juice or vitamin C helps the liver filter out the free radicals which flow in your bloodstream. Apart from improving the immune system, lemon juice also helps your digestive system to digest the nutrients your body receives. Being from the citrus family, Lemons are very effective when it comes to stabilizing the digestive system and also the blood flow. It does not allow indigestible particles to enter the bloodstream. It acts as a filtration system in our body and removes all the toxins which will give your liver some time from the process of filtration function. This will give liver time to rebuild itself and become more efficient. Another major function of the liver is producing bile flow. By increasing the bile flow, the cleansing of the liver is more effective. The bile juice removes unwanted substances from the body and takes them out. When the filtration is taken care of by the lemon juice, the liver gets more time to produce more bile flow. This, in turn, improves the cleansing system of the liver.Artichoke increases the bile production. Bile removes the toxins and harmful micro-organisms from the body through healthy bowel movement.Anti-oxidants protect the liver from the free radicals which are produced during the detoxification. These free radicals are harmful to the body. Some suggested fruits are prunes, blueberries, plums, oranges, pears, cantaloupes etc.The bitterness present in the leafy greens helps in the stimulation of bile in the liver. Some bitter salad greens are chicory, dandelion, endive etc. All the above-given foods should be a part of a diet for a healthy liver.Most of us are aware of the adverse effects of tobacco on the liver. It has been discovered that tobacco can induce specific cytochrome P450 enzymes in the human liver, and enhance the chances of smokers to the harmful hepatotoxic effects of some medications, including acetaminophen. Also, smoking tobacco can lower the liver\u2019s ability and function to detoxify dangerous compounds. It has been also discovered that smoking can affect the drug dose required to treat a specific liver disease. To make the matter worse, smoking can worsen the condition of alcoholic liver disease. Read on to know more about the adverse effects of tobacco on the liver.Smoking tobacco can severely affect the function of your liver. The various toxins and harmful chemicals found in the tobacco cause scarring and chronic inflammation in the liver. These conditions, in turn, enhance your chances of suffering liver damage including ailments like liver fibroids, liver cancer and Hepatitis B and C. To make the condition worse, smoking cigarettes severally affects the way the liver processes and metabolizes medications as well as alcohol. This can increase the risk of alcoholism. Also, it can increase one\u2019s overall alcohol and drug tolerance levels.Your liver actually functions as a natural filter. The sole purpose of the liver is to prevent any toxic substance from entering the bloodstream. Additionally, the liver aids in metabolizing carbohydrates and sugars. Also, it regulates the bile flow. Bile helps in the process of digestion. So, you must know the importance of liver as one can\u2019t survive without it. Once the liver is agitated, then your immune system automatically weakens and you become more susceptible to infections and diseases. One of the harmful toxins found in tobacco, N-Nitrosodiethylamine, can lead to the development of liver tumours. One more toxin, N-Nitrosopyrrolidine, can lead to liver cancer. Hence, it is very important to know about the effects of tobacco on the liver to help you to quit smoking for a good health.

I wake up earlier than I used to, immediately put on my shoes and head out the door to get some fresh air on a stroll around the neighborhood. Although it\u2019s a small daily habit, here are a few of the major impacts it has had on my life so far\u2026A morning walk is the best way to wake your brain up for the day, because the sun\u2019s daylight enters your eyes and communicates to your brain that it\u2019s time to stop sleeping. But there are even more positive benefits from moderate sunlight exposure. Sunlight signals serotonin production in the brain, which raises your mood. It also helps your body absorb vitamin D, which is responsible for many important functions in your body and boosts your immune system. Research studies have even correlated walking with increased creative thinking and improved memory.So, instead of going through my morning routine still groggy and half-asleep, now I come home after walking and feel more energized and ready for the day. A walk also gives me time to organize my thoughts and formulate a plan of attack for the day\u2019s work. When I return home, I feel more prepared and less stressed about tackling all of the day\u2019s tasks. I even enjoy my morning routine more, simply because I\u2019m more awake and feel more in control of my day.I\u2019m thirty years old and consider myself a mostly fit person, but this year I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and have been dealing with debilitating pain and discomfort ever since. I used to work out daily, but as I discovered with my diagnosis, most forms of exercise actually cause stress and inflammation in the body, which is not good for arthritis. Walking, however, is easy on the body and still offers multiple health benefits. In fact, researchers have found that moderate walking offers the same health benefits as vigorous running \u2014improves endurance and circulation, prevents weight gain, and lowers the risk of stroke, chronic disease and cancer \u2014 but is much easier on the joints.After my daily walk, my joints not only feel better but my body also feels stronger. I\u2019ve also noticed an improvement in digestion, because walking boosts my metabolism before I eat my usual breakfast. And these effects last all day long, because I experience less pain and fatigue now throughout the day.This is the most important benefit to a daily walk outside. I started this habit because of what I read about the power of \u201csisu\u201d as part of the Finnish lifestyle. Of course, there are many health benefits to spending time out in nature, because we human beings simply belong there \u2014 breathing fresh air, feeling the natural temperature, and dealing with the elements. But even more importantly, in the modern era, humans spend far too much time in artificial environments, which not only destroys our health, but also our spirit. Truthfully, I started going on morning walks to replace my old habit of waking up and instantly checking my phone. I have to say that going on walks is much more soul-satisfying. The morning walk is now my sacred quiet time before the hustle and bustle of the day begins. I have time to reflect on life and check in with myself, which also nourishes the soul.I would argue that walking outside every day even makes me feel more alive. Instead of just driving by my surroundings on my way to work, walking gives me time to look around and appreciate the natural environment. Since I\u2019ve started this habit, I\u2019ve gotten to witness the change from winter to spring and now summer. I paid more attention to the trees and flowers blooming and to the birds emerging from hibernation and chirping their morning songs. I also notice the people who are already awake and outdoors with me\u2014the commuters and the other walkers, runners and bikers \u2014 which makes me feel more connected to my community and feel like I\u2019m a part of something bigger. Some days, my husband even joins me and taking morning walks together has strengthened our relationship. We get to connect with each other more meaningfully before we both head off to work and we both enjoy the same overall positive health benefits throughout the day.Needless to say, something as small as a daily morning walk has profoundly enhanced my life. Now, I encourage you to try this daily habit for yourself. Even if you only have a few minutes to walk outside every morning, you can experience these amazing benefits too.Written byWritten by","13338":"When we view our lives as a whole, single days don\u2019t seem all that important. We\u2019ll always have tomorrow \u2014 what\u2019s so special about today?It\u2019s a valid question. After all, life is full of second chances, new dawns, fresh starts. It seems perfectly reasonable to delay our hopes and dreams for just another day, write that article tomorrow or sleep in until the afternoon.But in our procrastinating efforts, we\u2019re missing one crucial detail. Life is just a long string of todays. Each day matters as much as the next \u2014 even this one.As James T. McCay put it,\u201cTomorrow you promise yourself will be different, yet tomorrow is too often a repetition of today.\u201dIf tomorrow is, indeed, too often a repetition of today, it follows that we should learn how to make today as great as it can be \u2014 to prime our minds for maximum performance, happiness and progress. But how?It all starts with simple steps that contribute to improve our overall wellbeing; habits that become our way of life and improve our state of mind. Here are six to get you started:Walking has long been used as a remedy for stress, and it\u2019s also great for peace of mind, productivity and inspiration. In the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, \u2018all truly great thoughts are conceived while walking\u2019.Make it a daily habit to head out into nature, take a break from the busyness of day-to-day living and let your creativity flow. Reset your clock both mentally and physicallyWhether you\u2019re bored, tired, stressed, sad or just need a change of scenery \u2014 go for a walk and you\u2019ll feel much better for it. It\u2019s easy exercise. Just move.We all have temptations and urges: to stay in bed, eat junk food, cancel our meetings. Succumbing to these only makes us more likely to give into similar temptations throughout the rest of our day. After all, the opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the movie.When you resist temptation once, you change your mindset to one that pushes you to get more done. You become part of a chain reaction of accomplishments, fuelled by you.Instead of giving into false desires and delaying your progress until tomorrow, just do what you need to do and filter out any temptations. Trust your gut. Say no to that slice of cake and put down your phone instead of scrolling. You\u2019ll thank yourself for it.Every single day. Just read. It doesn\u2019t matter what, who, where \u2014 even just a few pages of reading each day provides infinite benefits. Read philosophy, fiction, romance. Anything.There are millions of books in existence, each one an embodiment of somebody else\u2019s life and experiences \u2014 their lifelong wisdom imparted into small, easily-digestible stories.Even books about subjects you care little for, be they finances or physics, will serve to broaden your mind and enlighten you to new perspectives. And if you don\u2019t have time to read, make time. Spend less time scrolling through social media or watching TV and use those extra thirty minutes to read.Amidst the chaos of day-to-day living, how often do take the time simply to be still? When do we ever press the pause button on our to-do list and take five minutes just to breathe?If you\u2019re anything like me, very rarely is probably the answer. But working really hard and never stopping to rest only makes us feel more stressed and less productive in the long run.So once every day, try and find ways to unplug yourself. Put down your phone, get away from the noise and just be. Let your thoughts come and go, listen to the sounds around you and settle into this moment. You\u2019ll feel much better for it.At the end of every day, take some time to reflect. Did you complete all of the tasks you\u2019d planned to? Do you wish you\u2019d behaved differently at any moment?Don\u2019t judge your actions. Just observe, checking in with yourself and making sure you\u2019re on the right track. And if you\u2019re not, you can tweak things a little when you wake up the next morning.Reviewing isn\u2019t about being critical or beating yourself up. It\u2019s about having a conversation with yourself and making a progress report to ensure that your actions align with your values, beliefs and goals.Neglecting sleep in favour of hard work is a habit that always seems to be romanticized. \u2018I\u2019ll sleep when I\u2019m dead,\u2019 say the hardcore hustlers across social media, gloating about the fact that they hardly sleep so that they can get more work completed.But the thing is, without sleep, we\u2019re nothing. We can\u2019t function. Our bodies fall ill. Our concentration falters.Neglecting rest for a few hours may indeed allow us to get more done in the short-term, but it\u2019ll catch up with us before long. In the words of Tom Roth,\u2018Sleep is an investment in the energy you need to be effective tomorrow.\u2019It is the foundation of all of the above habits and by far the most important on this list. Sleep is what keeps us alive, and it\u2019s crucial to success in any area. Simply making sure that you\u2019re sleeping enough and at sensible times will improve the quality of every day that you have.I\u2019m Adrian. If you\u2019d like, I can send free daily tips about succeeding as a creative (and staying sane along the way) right to your inbox in bitesize chunks.Just follow this link.Written byWritten by","13368":"Yesterday evening I had a free couple of hours. Earlier, I\u2019d planned on using the time to get ahead of my writing, maybe work on my newsletter, schedule lots of Instagram posts, and go for a run. Ideally, I\u2019d be in bed by 10 pm with a soothing cup of peppermint tea, reading a novel or self-help book and not looking at my phone because I know blue screens before bed can interrupt my sleep patterns, likely to make me less productive tomorrow.This was the plan.But I\u2019d had a hard day. Things had gone wrong at work, clients had complained, my bike chain had snapped, I\u2019d snapped at my colleague because I was annoyed about my bike and work.So instead, when I got home, I ordered a pizza, got out my phone to browse Twitter, and put RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race on my laptop. I watched for four hours straight.I went to bed, having accomplished none of the things I wanted to. In fact, I\u2019d done all the things you aren\u2019t supposed to do \u2014 bringing my work home by ranting at my partner about it; eating junk food; skipping exercise to watch TV; staring mindlessly at multiple screens; staying up late instead of going to bed early. I drank red wine instead of herbal tea, and I did not read my self-help book.I expected to feel guilty for giving in to my baser instincts, like some kind of animal who doesn\u2019t know how to maximize productivity. I was prepared to feel ashamed, sad, downhearted and like a failure.But you know what? It was nice. It was better than nice, actually, it was amazing. It felt so good to take off the burden of expectations for myself and just let myself have one unproductive evening. My wine tasted better than the herbal tea I should have drunk, watching TV was more fun than scheduling Instagram posts, and I don\u2019t actually like running, no matter how many times I claim the endorphins get me high.Everyone has a side hustle these days. Literally everyone. Side gigs which can be performed any time that you\u2019re not occupied with your actual, main, wage-paying job.And what\u2019s more, is most of these gigs have a performance which is visibly measurable. I constantly check my readership stats on my blog. I can track my income on my phone. My Instagram brain is never switched off because I\u2019m always ready to take that perfect soon-to-be-viral photo.The outcome of this is that we expect ourselves to be productive nonstop. We\u2019re able to produce stuff nonstop, and we have the tools to measure how much other people like your stuff. There\u2019s never a good excuse to switch off because every moment spent relaxing is actually a moment you\u2019re losing potential income, visibility, readership, fans.Not only that, but we\u2019re told by Buzzfeed and self-help books and Gary Vaynerchuk that in order to be \u201csuccessful,\u201d in order to reach that unattainable summit which so few people seem to achieve, we can\u2019t really have time off.If we do take time off, it has to be carefully scheduled and managed in order to maximize our efficiency for when we\u2019re switched back \u201con.\u201d Even our downtime has to be optimized for peak productivity.Breaks aren\u2019t really breaks, they\u2019re orchestrated pauses that help you get back up to maximum efficiency. Newsflash to everyone: that\u2019s not a break.Personally speaking, I struggle to switch off. It\u2019s because I know that every second I\u2019m not writing my blog, or monitoring my Instagram account, or organizing my meals, or doing any of the other thousand tasks I do to keep on top of adulting, I\u2019m missing out.If I don\u2019t pick out my outfit the night before, it means I\u2019ll rush through my morning routine, giving me a bad start to my day. Unproductive.If I don\u2019t post to Instagram, I\u2019ll miss out on followers and exposure. Unproductive.If I don\u2019t write down ideas that occur to me for blog posts, I\u2019ll struggle to come up with original content and fall behind. Unproductive.It\u2019s like a never-ending song in my head telling me to get my act together all the time. If I stand still for even a second, if I don\u2019t create or produce or plan, I\u2019m falling behind.I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a good way to live, and I realized last night, it\u2019s how I\u2019ve been living for a long time. When I started working on my side hustles, it felt like every unoptimized second of my life would potentially cost me money, fame, exposure. Every unproductive afternoon would be punished somehow.So this is my startling realization: I like being unproductive. I like it, not because it relaxes me and preps me for productivity tomorrow, but precisely because it is expectation-free.So many blog posts advocate \u201cmindful resting\u201d or \u201cactive relaxation\u201d only as a means by which to gain further productivity after the break.I say no \u2014 enjoy inactivity and laziness and unproductiveness for their own sakes, not for how much they\u2019ll make you produce tomorrow.When I dream of being \u201csuccessful,\u201d which to me is a vague idea of not really worrying about anything, I don\u2019t see myself spending every second of that happy future working diligently to maximize my output. I don\u2019t believe that my best, happiest self is one that\u2019s constantly grinding.\u201cSuccessful\u201d Zulie has a house in the mountains, perhaps raising a small flock of chickens. She likes to cook extravagant meals, and she frequently gives in to bursts of whimsy. She\u2019s successful in that she spends a lot of time doing nothing valuable in particular and not feeling guilty about it.That\u2019s where I want to be.Yesterday evening was the first time in a long time I took time off. I came home and made a choice not to do anything remotely useful. I don\u2019t know if it means I\u2019m going to be better tomorrow, and I don\u2019t particularly care.I\u2019m sure that going to bed after staring at a TV for hours, not resolving my emotions about work, eating junk food, and not setting myself up to have a stress-free morning is not good. It\u2019s not productive.But I refuse to feel guilty about it. I will not be ashamed of being unproductive. I will actively schedule more inactivities for myself, not because they\u2019ll make me better, but because my best life is one that isn\u2019t streamlined for optimization \u2014 it\u2019s one where I relax every once in a while.Success, to me, can\u2019t mean an arbitrary amount of income, or certain number of followers, or getting a morning routine ironed out flawlessly, because at that point I\u2019m just aiming to become a machine. No, I think success lies in unproductivity. It lies in the ability to do nothing, and not give a damn.Get my 4-day email course on how to start making money on Medium.Written byWritten by","13387":"N.b. This was meant to be funny. I think it got a little too salty somewhere along the way. Or maybe that\u2019s just me. \u2014 ZxObviously, I think this is a tending-toward-infinity thing.As in, I am \u2014 shall we say \u2014 at the bottom of the bell curve when it comes to traditional Western masculine attractiveness standards. Meaning, I need a infinite amount of beauty sleep. Like, yesterday.Either I need to find a genie in a bottle, or I need to get started on my beauty sleep. I imagine that you don\u2019t start earning beauty sleep until you pay back your sleep debt, so I\u2019m in bed for a good few decades. It\u2019s time for me to start climbing up from that -3-sigma.It should only take about a decade of sleep or so to get into that +2\/+3-sigma range.

Talk about passive income.Sarah Dessen is one of the reigning queens of Contemporary Young Adult fiction. She\u2019s been doing it longer than most everybody else in the genre, does it better than everyone else.She has probably already written the book that I\u2019m thinking up right now. And, frankly, she\u2019s better equipped to be writing it than I am. If she writes it, it will probably be published. If I write it, chances are that I won\u2019t be good enough to get represented, let alone publish it.So, the obvious thing to do is to stop writing, and to send all of my ideas Sarah\u2019s way. At least then, there\u2019s a chance I can see that story and those characters on a bookshelf someday.No matter what you write or what you do, there\u2019s probably a Sarah Dessen in the field. You can stop. You can relax. You can rest easy. They did it before you. They did it better than you. They\u2019ll keep on doing it until the bitter end.Today, I woke up with the thought: Adulthood: where every positive accomplishment is really just a Russian nesting doll full of new shit to worry about.Short, and pithy enough for a tweet. Which, as of this writing, has not only not gone viral, but doesn\u2019t have a single like or retweet.Don\u2019t worry, some other asshole will post the exact same thing in a week or two, and get a few hundred thousand interactions on it.Because why do I need luck or money or online fame when I can just be saddled down with the eternal anxiety of worrying about money.Just for an example, the car. Having a car is supposed to make your life better. It\u2019s supposed to open up your horizons and make your life easier. Get you to and from work. Make it so you can make more money.That is, until you realize, you have to dump thousands of dollars into it every year. The gas you realize, of course.But also the thousands of dollars in car insurance, just so you have a piece of paper to show to the cop if you get pulled over. (Having insurance did jack-fuck-all for me when I was in a car accident). And hundreds of dollars a year in paying the government for a sticker to put on your license plate, so you don\u2019t get pulled over by the police. And oil changes, which are apparently a thing you\u2019re supposed to get on a regular basis, and new tires and a AAA card, and the new snow tires you need for driving the rural Pennsylvania switchbacks and the windshield wiper stopped working on one side, which\u2019ll be a few hundred dollars to look at, and then probably a few thousand more to fix, and . . . and . . . and . . .The worries with adulthood never seem to end. Even the good things are fraught with their own complications. And, as much as getting published seems like a dream, you just know it\u2019s going to come with its own mountain of shit to be anxious about.And, yeah, chances are that I\u2019m not going to stop. Or, at least, I\u2019m not stopping today. Some days, that\u2019s about as far as I can commit: I am not going to quit today.Because I\u2019m never going to be beautiful, Sarah Dessen is never going to write my stories, and the anxiety is not going to go away.You don\u2019t have to be happy about it. You\u2019re not always going to be fulfilled. This shit\u2019s not always going to give you the warm and tinglies.Today, it sucks.Tomorrow and Saturday, I\u2019m going to be in New York City, so things probably won\u2019t suck.Next week, once the adrenaline and joy wear off, and the deep physical pain of dragging my large ass though that city sets in, and the creative well of energy dries up, it\u2019ll probably suck again.But you either keep going, or you don\u2019t.There\u2019s a phrase from Tolkien\u2019s poem Mythopoeia that sticks in my head at moments like this:Blessed are the men of Noah\u2019s race that buildtheir little arks, though frail and poorly filled,and steer through winds contrary towards a wraith,a rumour of a harbour guessed by faithMost days, I don\u2019t have faith in God. Hell, most days I don\u2019t have any faith in myself. I\u2019m pretty sure that all of this hard work I put in is going to be all for nothing.I have nothing else to fall back on. No other laurels, no other legacy, no other way for the world to remember me. Just these words that keep failing to do anything.I don\u2019t know how I keep going.

Both are within our grasp, and both begin with us making subtle shifts in our habits and perspective.In the wise words of the Dalai Lama,\u2018Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions\u2019If that\u2019s the case, which actions can we take to secure a lifetime of peace and joy? Where do we begin? These are, indeed, difficult questions to answer. Thankfully, Japanese culture and philosophy provide us with a lot to learn.In essence, the Japanese rely not on big achievements and expensive possessions for happiness, but on finding joy in the simple.Instead of going out of your way to seek the extraordinary, what if you could instead live in a more carefree and peaceful way by making subtle changes to your regular everyday life?That\u2019s what this article is all about. Simple living.There\u2019s something magical about the early morning \u2014 that short period of time during which the entire world seems to be sleeping and we\u2019re the only person on the planet. And yet, as wonderful as it is, how often do we actually rise to embrace the morning air?The same process repeats itself every single day, waiting to be witnessed. The sun rises, light returns and, before long, the worker bees return to their many duties. The world awakens. Morning is the only time of day when we can truly experience these changes.More, when we wake early to embrace the morning air, we inadvertently hone another important skill: mindfulness. Simply by taking a moment to put down all distractions, take a deep breath and reconnect with the world around us, we practice being in the here and now.After all, much of our worries arise when we fail to be truly present. When we get caught up in the past and the future.It\u2019s exactly as Amit Ray said,\u2018Looking at beauty in the world is the first step of purifying the mind.\u2019Waking early might not sound like such a grand change to make, but this isn\u2019t about making grand changes. It\u2019s about connecting small adjustments to create an overall spectacle of peace.So let\u2019s begin our journey towards happiness by making time to savour the most peaceful time of the day\u2014 the early morning.Often the cause of our misery is that we feel as though we\u2019re lacking something, be it a new car, promotion or loving spouse. But before we begin craving more, doesn\u2019t it make sense to first part with the things we don\u2019t need?The practice of decluttering is a fundamental part of simple living. Japanese author Marie Kondo popularized this idea with her bestselling book \u2018The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up\u2019. In it, she writes the following:\u2018The process of assessing how you feel about the things you own, identifying those that have fulfilled their purpose, expressing your gratitude, and bidding them farewell, is really about examining your inner self, a rite of passage to a new life.\u2019The first step to a simple and peaceful life is to remove from it the things that make us feel stressed. It\u2019s hard to truly relax when you\u2019re surrounded by things you don\u2019t need.Living simply isn\u2019t just about discarding material possessions, though. It\u2019s also about letting go of physical and mental burdens.It\u2019s amazing how refreshing a good cry can be. In the same way, it\u2019s incredibly freeing to tell a person how we truly feel about something or confront a problem that\u2019s been weighing us down for a long time. That\u2019s what letting go is all about.The act of discarding and detaching from mental and physical burdens is, of course, more difficult than it sounds. It can be very hard to lose people we hold dear to us. But how long can we go on for, perpetuating unhealthy relationships and situations?If we want to improve the way things are, to live with a lighter heart and freedom to be at peace, we must start by discarding \u2014 even if it is difficult. The moment we begin to detach, we allow a new feeling of abundance into our lives. Then and only then can be truly be free.When we believe in ourselves, we unlock a vast array of possibilities. We allow ourselves to reach our full potential.Another common tenet of Zen living is this:\u2018All things come from nothing.\u2019We\u2019re all born completely naked. No clothes, hair, possessions, relationships. We started from nothing, and from that, we built up all of the things that we now have.There are infinite capabilities within all of us. Inside nothingness, there is infinite potential. Even in our darkest times, even if we\u2019re starting from rock bottom or if we stand to lose everything, sometimes that can be a good thing. We have a lot to gain.Of course, it\u2019s easy to sit here and say that we have potential. But how do we actually unleash it? How do we make the most of our capabilities?It all starts with actively boosting your belief in yourself. To unleash more of your potential. To do more. If you\u2019re a writer, write more and prove your abilities to yourself. If you paint, paint masterpieces. Prove to yourself that you\u2019re capable of great things.Life doesn\u2019t always plan out as we hope it will. Sometimes our greatest efforts go unrewarded. Regardless, it\u2019s important to try to believe in yourself and do your best \u2014 even if rewards don\u2019t always show. Don\u2019t fear moving forward.As humans, we only ever live in this moment \u2014 in the here and now. No matter how much we think about and contemplate the past and the future, really, all we ever have is the present.In order to truly be at peace, we must train our mind to be present in this very instant. Mindfulness is a fundamental element of Zen living. Actually being mindful, however, is often trickier than it sounds.One of the simplest ways to train yourself to live mindfully is to begin with the breath. As author Shunmy\u014d Masuno puts it:\u2018We inhale, and then we exhale. The moment we inhale is the present, but once we exhale, it has already become the past.\u2019Our breathing is like an anchor. In moments during which we feel anxious or afraid, worried about the past or future, we can reconnect to the present by focusing on our breath.By repeating this practice, eventually, mindful living becomes our default. We live permanently in the now. After all, what is most important is this day, this hour and this moment. Nothing else needs to concern us.I run a daily newsletter The Daily Grind where I send out tips to creatives and entrepreneurs about success, wellness and honing their craft.If that sounds like you, follow this link to sign up.Written byWritten by","13710":"Today I woke up at the ungodly hour of 6 AM.As the kind of person that regularly goes to bed around 2\u20134 AM, and regularly doesn\u2019t wake up until somewhere between 9 AM and Noon, this is literally my idea of a nightmare.Compounded is the fact that I couldn\u2019t eat anything since Midnight, since I was scheduled for an 8 AM ultrasound.Seriously: The only thing worse than having to watch the sunrise was having to watch it on an empty stomach. I couldn\u2019t even have anything to drink. Not even lame, boring, water.Arrrrrrrgh.Thankfully, there wasn\u2019t a very long line of people in the hospital\u2019s imaging department. I was able to go in, get my abdomen mauled by a madman with a wand and ice-cold gel, and get out without too much trouble. (No, I\u2019m not pregnant, thank you for asking.)But then I was faced with a whole, entire morning, almost four hours where I should have been blissfully sleeping, but wasn\u2019t.Some of that time was spent at WalMart, picking up prescriptions and getting my glasses replaced \u2014 no more duct tape and one arm broken off. But even after I got home it was like \u2014 okay, I\u2019ve done everything for today, and it\u2019s still two hours before I\u2019d even wake up.What the hell, right?I like sleep. I like sleep a lot, even if I don\u2019t sleep all that well. And what\u2019s more, I\u2019m a definite night owl. I do some good work at night.But there\u2019s something industrious-sounding about being a morning person. Rising with the Sun, accomplishing things while the rest of the world sleeps. You start your day with getting stuff done.I think morning people just have better PR. It shouldn\u2019t matter how my sixteen hours of daily consciousness and work sync up with the rise and fall of some ball of hot gas.But still, it kinda does. At least, in the minds of other people.Ideal!Zach is definitely a morning person. Real!Zach is not.

And, honestly, it\u2019s not all that surprising.And that\u2019s when it all kind of hit me. Every lab test I\u2019ve had in the last few years flashed in my mind \u2014 My fasting glucose and A1c have in fact been relatively high consistently (102 mg\/dl \u2192 anything over 100 mg\/dl is standard pre-diabetic \/ diabetic, and 5.4% A1c \u2192 5.7% and up is pre-diabetic \/ diabetic) \u2014 but every other doctor shrugged it off because I don\u2019t \u201clook diabetic\u201d, and I\u2019m the \u201cimage of health\u201d. In fact, they told me \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201dAnd that\u2019s what I believed too. I told myself I was invincible and doing everything right. This stuff happens to other people, not me.When I took stock over what was actually happening versus the story I had in my mind \u2014 here\u2019s what was going on:We\u2019re working our butts off to build Rupa. I\u2019m not sleeping much (5\u20136 hours \/ night), I stopped going to acupuncture, I almost always convince myself I\u2019m too busy to meditate, and I\u2019m too exhausted to workout anymore.It\u2019s a good day if the only thing I stress eat is an excessive amount of the peanut butter pretzels on the snack shelf at the office. And maybe a bite or two of the leftover birthday cake (it\u2019s always someone\u2019s birthday, even though I still justify it as a \u201cspecial occasion\u201d in my head\u2026). This is a good day.And I call myself \u201chealthy\u201d.So now I am eyeballs deep into research on how lifestyle affects metabolic health, on how stress can trigger this, and how my genes might play a role.

The jury is still out, and I don\u2019t have concrete answers.But waiting around to get an \u201cofficial diagnosis\u201d is the antithesis of what we\u2019re building at Rupa \u2014 so I\u2019m taking action.Get a variety of opinions \u2014 conventional and alternative. Be smart, do the research, and use Rupa as a resource of course. :)Take your health in your hands \u2014 use experts as guidance rather than irrefutable truth.We cannot blame diabetes on any single factor. The disease process is actually driven by a complex network of diet and lifestyle factors, oxidative stress, and genetics.Within this network, we can only work on the things within our control, like nutrition, sleep, stress, exercise, etc.The first thing I do when I wake up is drink warm lemon water and eat a handful of blueberries. This is controversial (under the \u201celiminate sugar, fruit is sugar\u201d perspective). However, I eat almost only berries which have a lower glycemic index, are high in antioxidants, and reduce inflammation. And honestly, it just makes cutting out processed sugar totally do-able.Oh, and no fake sugars either (stevia, etc.) They may play tricks on our brain that make us crave even more sugar and junk foods.Vitamin D regulates inflammation and insulin sensitivity. Supplementing reduces inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetics.How much? The amount is controversial. Recommendations go from 400IU all the way to 10,000IU depending on many factors, however the current upper limit by the government is 2000IU. I\u2019m dark skinned, rarely get sun in San Francisco, and am low in Vitamin D, so I take more (and I work with a functional medicine doctor). Generally, if you\u2019re deficient, most functional or integrative medicine practitioners will recommend around 5000IU or more per day. (disclaimer: please do your research, talk to your doctor and healthcare partners, before blindly following anyone\u2019s \u2014 including my \u2014 recommendations!)Reishi and Ashwagandha have been touted for many benefits from cancer therapies to immune boosting to stress relievers and more. Honestly, there isn\u2019t enough research out there to be definitive about most of this. But what I do know, is that when I take a dropper of pure double extraction Reishi and an Ashwagandha supplement, I sleep way, WAY better. Plus, it\u2019s not melatonin (which is actually a hormone and shouldn\u2019t be taken long term) or sleeping pills, so I feel much better about taking them on a frequent basis.I\u2019m SUPER bullish on breathwork \u2014 oxygen saturation, cortisol lowering, mind clearing\u2026so, so many benefits. More than anything, I just feel instantly better afterwards. There\u2019s many types of breathwork out there, and I\u2019ve tried quite a few of them. I like these two because they achieve different results for me: 4\u20137\u20138 gets me out of my sympathetic (fight or flight) and into my parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous system in 90 seconds. I use this during the day whenever I feel anxiety creeping up. Just 1 round of Wim Hof in the morning does many things for me, but basically saturates my body with oxygen \u2014 which is an incredible high feeling and leaves me happy and clear headed.There\u2019s so much more, but I\u2019ll leave you with this for now!

And 32,000 standardized scientific muffins.It all adds up to PREDICT 1 \u2014 the biggest nutritional study of its kind.Led by ZOE\u2019s scientific founder and Professor at King\u2019s College London, Tim Spector \u2014 together with researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) \u2014 PREDICT 1 measured how blood levels of markers such as sugar, insulin and fat change in response to specific meals.The team also gathered data on activity, sleep, mood, hunger and gut bacteria (microbiome) in more than a thousand participants in the US and UK, mostly pairs of twins.The biggest finding is that everyone has their own unique response to food \u2014 even identical twins. This means that everyone is different and there is no one right way to eat.Why are we going to the trouble of running such a huge research project?It\u2019s all part of our mission to solve a seemingly simple but surprisingly hard question: what should I eat to be healthier?Sound interesting? Sign up to our early access mailing list to be the first to know how you can find the foods your body loves.Not only is it the largest study of its kind ever undertaken, what makes PREDICT 1 really special is how we used new technologies \u2014 like stick-on glucose monitors, at-home blood collection, food logging apps and machine learning \u2014 to measure, understand and predict what happens within the body when someone eats a meal (nutritional response).In total, we captured millions of individual datapoints from more than a thousand participants as they munched their way through 32,000 standardized test muffins and a hundred thousand regular meals.All this data gives us a vastly more detailed picture of individual nutritional responses to food than has ever been captured before. For example, we now have what is probably the largest database of blood fat and glucose responses in the world.We were expecting to see differences in personal nutritional responses. However, we were surprised to discover such a wide variation in responses to the same foods, even between identical twins who share all their genes and much of their environment.Strikingly, we also discovered that identical twins shared just 37% of their gut microbes, only slightly higher than the 35% shared between two unrelated people.The message is clear: when it comes to something as personal as food, we\u2019re all different and there is no one right way to eat.We\u2019re now focused on taking this data and training our increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict how someone will respond to any meal.And we\u2019re working with Professors Christopher Gardner at Stanford University and Andrew T. Chan at MGH to recruit participants for PREDICT 2 \u2014 an expanded, home-based study of 1,000 people across the US.Find out how you can join our studies or sign up for early access to our consumer product at joinZOE.com and follow us on Instagram & TwitterThe PREDICT 1 results were presented by Tim Spector MD FRCP FRSB (Professor, King\u2019s College London, UK) and Sarah Berry Ph.D (Senior Lecturer, King\u2019s College London) and Paul Franks Ph.D. (Professor, Lund University, Sweden) at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and American Society for Nutrition (ASN) meetings in San Francisco and Baltimore on 10th\/11th June 2019.

And that\u2019s not spiritual quackery. It\u2019s not hyperbole. It\u2019s the practical truth. All that\u2019s required is a modicum of practice and discipline, which I\u2019ll get to.But first, what I mean by agony is suffering caused by either physical or emotional pain, which covers the whole gamut. Physical pain is breaking your leg or getting a headache. Emotional pain occurs when your girlfriend breaks up with you.In both cases, there are two kinds of pain \u2014 primary and secondary. The primary pain of having a headache is that you feel actual pain in your head and it hurts. The secondary pain is what you ADD on top of the primary pain and is emotional in nature. \u201cThis headache is never going to go away. Why does this always happen to me? My friends never get headaches. I\u2019m so unlucky in life\u2026\u201d When your girlfriend breaks up with you, the primary pain comes from the sadness that you won\u2019t be seeing her as much anymore and the feeling of rejection.The secondary pain is when you go down the rumination rabbit hole: \u201cOf course she broke up with me. I\u2019m worthless. I\u2019ll never end up with anybody because let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m a loser.\u201d OR \u201cX is the most vile, awful woman who\u2019s ever lived. I absolutely despise her.\u201d In other words, secondary pain is about flipping out over primary pain. What most people don\u2019t realize is that secondary pain causes as much or more suffering as the primary pain it\u2019s responding to.Primary pain is an inevitable and necessary part of life. Pure and simple. It\u2019s part of being human. Loved ones will die, bones will be broken and relationships will end. One of the basic tenets of Buddhism is to accept the fact that there is suffering in life.The key is eliminating secondary painThe key to living a peaceful, fulfilling life is learning how to RESPOND to primary pain. In other words, to learn how to eliminate, or vastly reduce, secondary pain, aka flipping out pain. How to do this? That\u2019s the crux of this piece so dial in.I\u2019ll explain with an example from my own life. First, a short history. I grew up in Newport Beach, California, left in 1982 to go to college back East, worked in politics in Washington, DC, for 15 years, then worked as a television writer in LA\/Hollywood for 15 years. A year ago my wife and I moved our family from Los Angeles to Newport Beach, a town I hadn\u2019t lived in since 1982. The schools are great, I have a brother and two sisters living here and the only reason we lived in LA was because of the Hollywood writing thing and I\u2019d decided to move on from that. So we moved in June of last year.And for the first six weeks or so I felt\u2026well, weird. I\u2019d moved home. It was mind-blowing. And not in a good way. I was driving down streets I drove down in high school. I was assistant coaching my daughter\u2019s soccer team at the junior high school I attended, walking past the gym where I played on the school basketball and volleyball teams. We held our soccer practices on a field around which was the track where I tied a school record in the \u00be mile run\u2026in 1978! It all made me feel anxious and panicky. What if this move was a huge mistake? What if I completely freaked out and we had to skedaddle?After a few weeks of this it occurred to me that I could put my meditation and mindfulness training to use. (I\u2019ve been meditating regularly the past six years.) What I did was any time that anxious feeling arose inside I\u2019d get myself to do two things. First, I\u2019d get myself to acknowledge that I was feeling anxious. Second, I would get myself to say, \u201cOkay. You\u2019ve got that anxious feeling about moving to Newport. That\u2019s it. You\u2019re feeling it. It doesn\u2019t feel good. But it\u2019s there. Don\u2019t resist it. Just feel it and leave it alone.\u201dAcknowledge your primary pain, don\u2019t engage with itThat last part is critical. Leave it alone. Because what I just outlined is the same model as the primary, secondary pain above. The primary pain was the emotional weirdness I felt from moving back to my hometown. Much of that is fairly normal. But the secondary pain is what I was adding on to it those first few weeks. I\u2019d always prided myself on leaving the Newport Beach cocoon and heading East for college and then work in DC. And I\u2019m thinking, \u201cYou were a worldly guy for decades and now you\u2019re moving home. What are you doing with your life? What happened to you?\u201dI knew on some level that that thinking was off. That there\u2019s nothing inherently bad about moving back to the town of your childhood. Bottom line is I got myself to acknowledge that this anxious feeling was there, BUT, critically, I didn\u2019t allow myself to engage with that feeling. I didn\u2019t let myself wrestle with it and flip out over it. Doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t have the feeling (the primary pain) for a while. But by not engaging with it, what I did was allow this emotional \u201ccloud\u201d to pass. And pass it did. A year later I feel great about Newport Beach and couldn\u2019t be happier that we moved here.Allow the cloud to pass over youThis cloud analogy is a powerful one. Because the primary pain in our lives is that cloud and that cloud is going to rain on us. A death. A relationship gone south, etc. But what we do when we add that secondary pain on top of it, by engaging with it and tussling with it and arguing with it, is strengthen that cloud and allow it to remain over our heads and rain on us far longer than if we\u2019d just acknowledged it, felt its pain, and let it pass over us.Fine, that\u2019s all well and good, but if I\u2019m you I want some specifics on how to actually win the battle against secondary pain. The fact is that there is no five-step program for dealing with this. It really all comes down to doing one thing: making yourself aware of the primary pain and stopping yourself from going down the \u201cflip out\u201d rabbit hole. \u201cI have a headache. It hurts. I don\u2019t like it. And that\u2019s it.\u201d \u201cMy boyfriend broke up with me and I feel absolutely awful. I really love him and being with him and this is incredibly painful.\u201d And leave it at that. FEEL the primary pain, but don\u2019t flip out and let it become a big story of your past and your future.In practical terms, what would it take for you to be successful at conquering your secondary pain? Two things: commitment and discipline. And not that much of either. The commitment is just resolving to yourself that you\u2019re going to become aware when you start heaping secondary pain on top of the primary pain. That\u2019s all it is. Committing yourself to becoming aware.The discipline comes into play once you\u2019ve become aware of the situation. Because that is when you\u2019re going to have to stop yourself from doing what you\u2019ve been doing your whole life \u2014 flipping out over your primary pain. You just have to get good at saying to yourself, \u201cNo. This goes no further than the actual pain I\u2019m experiencing here. Not\u2026going\u2026to happen.\u201d Just cut it off at the pass.And how do you get good at this? The same way you got good at tennis, playing the piano or learning to speak Spanish \u2014 you PRACTICE. It may not happen overnight, but it really isn\u2019t that hard. Honestly, this is one of those rare scenarios in life where there is a whole lot of gain for not that much pain.Meditation will help you succeedWhat is the best way to enhance your chances of success on this? Develop a meditation practice. Why? Because one of the most important things meditation does is strengthen what I\u2019ll call your awareness muscle. All meditation is is sitting quietly and following something happening in the present moment, like your breath. Then, when your mind wanders, and it will, you simply become aware that that has happened and bring your attention back to your breath. That\u2019s all it is. With the strengthened awareness muscle that comes from meditation, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s much easier to become aware and catch yourself before flipping out and crawling down the rabbit hole of secondary pain.How do you get started with meditation? Contrary to what you may have heard, it\u2019s not that big a deal. Here\u2019s what you do. When I started meditating six years ago I created my own program. I made it simple, doable and designed it so that a regular person, like me, would be successful in developing a long-term practice. The program is eight-weeks and starts off with meditating for two minutes a day then building gradually from there. I strongly urge you to try it. It\u2019s free. You can access it at davidgerken.net.So do this! Eliminate your secondary pain. It\u2019s really not that hard and the benefits are enormous.Written byWritten by","13843":"Most of us are eating diets that are very different from what our earliest ancestors ate. But do we understand the long-term implications of these modern food choices? High protein, low carb diets are popular for weight loss, but there is increasing evidence that eating a lot of protein can be bad news for your gut health.When you eat protein, some can reach your large intestine without being fully digested. While your gut microbes prefer to eat carbs, they will start to eat that protein if you\u2019re on a low-carb diet. This is called \u201cprotein fermentation\u201c, and it can create potentially toxic by-products, gases and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA).Researchers have found that eating fibre that you can\u2019t digest can help maintain a healthy level of carb fermentation. By making sure your gut bacteria have carbs to ferment, you reduce the release of potentially harmful protein fermentation by-products.There are two types of dietary proteins: plant and animal. For example, peas, soy products and beans are all rich in plant proteins, while meat, cheese and eggs are high in animal proteins. In one study, a group of volunteers ate a diet high in animal proteins and fats, with almost no fibre. Another group ate plant-based products, with low protein and fat, but lots of fibre.Within one day, the volunteers on the animal-based diet had huge changes to the diversity and activity of their gut microbes. More specifically, this diet resulted in large amounts of bile-loving bugs like Alistipes, Bilophila and Bacteroides. These bugs can flourish in the presence of the bile, which is made by our bodies to break down fat from our diet. It\u2019s remarkable how quickly our gut microbes can adapt to what we eat. That can be both good and bad, depending on your diet! One of those microbes, Bilophila wadsworthia, is associated with increased inflammation. These bacteria produce hydrogen sulphide, which can be harmful to the intestinal environment. There\u2019s also evidence that high levels of B. wadsworthia may play a part in triggering gut disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Not only did the animal-based diet group end up with more harmful bacteria, they also had fewer good bugs, like Firmicutes. These carb-loving microbes play many essential roles for our health. For example, they make an important compound called butyrate. We use butyrate as an essential source of energy, and it also helps reduce inflammation and may also influence brain development and even behaviour.The plant-based diet group had more carb-loving bugs. As the microbes fermented the carbs, they created positive by-products. The human body can\u2019t make many of these compounds, like butyrate. You mainly get them through your diet, particularly by eating non-digestible carbs.Three days after the volunteers stopped eating these diets, their gut microbiomes returned to how they were before the study. These results show that eating a diet extremely high in animal protein may be harmful. The key to gut health is achieving balance. Despite the messaging of some popular diets, carbs aren\u2019t always bad and protein isn\u2019t always good. Finding a happy medium with both will help keep you and your microbiome healthy.FoodMarble AIRE is the world\u2019s first hydrogen breath tester. It is a pocket-sized breath analysis device.

And we all know that the food we choose have a big impact on our health.It also seems like everyone has an opinion on the best way to do it: low-carb, low-calorie, low fat, keto, paleo, high fiber, vegan, mindful eating\u2026 the list goes on.In a world of fad diets and conflicting advice, how do you know what\u2019s right for you?Here at ZOE, we believe that we are all unique and there is no one size fits all answer. To eat in a way that suits your body best, you need to understand how you work.Sound interesting? Sign up to our early access mailing list to be the first to know how you can find the foods your body loves.One key measure is nutritional responses to foods \u2014 how high the levels of molecules like fat, sugar (specifically glucose) and insulin rise in your blood after eating or drinking and how quickly they fall back to normal.Tracking these levels over time and plotting them on a graph gives us a nutritional response curve, which changes depending on the individual person, the food they\u2019ve eaten, the time of day, how active they\u2019ve been, any drugs they\u2019ve taken and even how much sleep they had the night before.We know that there is a close connection between nutritional responses, metabolism and health. For example, unhealthy blood sugar responses after eating have been linked to weight gain and conditions like diabetes, while persistent high levels of blood fat are linked to heart disease.Traditionally, doctors measure blood fat (triglycerides) and sugar (glucose) after fasting so they aren\u2019t affected by the food we eat. But the levels of these and other important molecules in the blood change throughout the day as we eat and drink.We typically spend more than 18 hours a day in what\u2019s known as a \u2018post-prandial\u2019 state, where blood fat and sugar levels are higher than those measured after fasting. This means that we\u2019re missing out on a lot of information about how our metabolism is really working.It\u2019s a little like deciding whether to buy a car in a parking lot, without actually taking it for a test drive. You can judge how it looks and kick the tires, but to really know how well it works you have to go for a ride.To find out what\u2019s going on under the hood, we\u2019re working in collaboration with scientists at some of the world\u2019s leading academic institutions including Massachusetts General Hospital, King\u2019s College London and Stanford University to monitor blood fat, sugar and insulin levels throughout the day in response to a range of meals and nutrients in thousands of people (with a little help from a lot of muffins\u2026)We also measure microbiome diversity, activity, sleep, hunger and mood. It all adds up to millions of measurements \u2014 the richest, largest dataset of its kind that has ever been gathered.We\u2019re feeding all this information into our hungry algorithm, which crunches the data and spits out predictions about how an individual will respond to any given meal. Right now, our predictions are a good match for what happens in real life, and they will only get better as our dataset grows.Next, we\u2019re developing a home-based test and app that will allow anyone to understand their nutritional responses and choose foods that optimize their metabolism for easier weight control and long-term health.We\u2019re not offering a fad diet or a list of impossible-to-follow rules.

Blue light is bad for your brain! Sleep is vital!The no-screens rule, as I\u2019ll call it, is driven by the idea that blue screens trick your brain into thinking it\u2019s daytime, so it doesn\u2019t wind down like it normally would at the onset of darkness. Even with screen filters, screens have been demonstrated to have negative effects on everything from sleep quality to alertness up to midday the next day.Honestly, the last few months, I\u2019d found I was tired at work. I really struggled to get up in the mornings. My appetite was weird. So, I decided to try the no-screens rule.In theory, the no-screens rule should have been easy to execute: all I needed to do was not look at any screens, be they computer, phone, tablet or television; resist the siren call of easy, immediate distraction; not fall prey to the allure of social media notifications.In practice, of course, I found it trickier.When I decided to make this change, one of the things I struggled with the most was that I was twitchy around bedtime. I did not adapt well to the no-screens rule; it felt like I was fighting myself to not hop on my laptop just quickly, or look at my Whatsapps just in case I\u2019d missed something.I desperately wanted to write a story, watch a quick episode of Buffy, check my Instagram account \u2014 I don\u2019t have notifications, so I check the app manually \u2014 or look at my emails.In essence, when I got bored going to sleep, my instinct was to soothe that urge by checking my phone.It was really, really hard to not do this. Especially for \u201cproductive\u201d things like checking emails, the temptation was incredibly difficult to resist, because I could almost always justify it in my mind.In the end, I had to leave all my devices in the living room and pile a bunch of books on my nightstand to provide something for my hand to grab when I instinctively reached over for distraction.Call it a crutch, call it a tool, but my phone was everything for me. Alarm to get up in the mornings, camera to photograph my cats being cute, ebook reader, recipe checker, flashlight. One hour before bed, I stopped all of it.In order to get accurate results, I was very strict. If I forgot to set my alarm on my phone, I got my boyfriend to do it for me. When I wanted to record my walk on MapMyRun, I had to upload it the next morning instead.Because my phone especially is practically an extension of my being, I felt like I lost out on a lot of functionality in my life. It was difficult to remember that there was an hour of my day that I wouldn\u2019t have access to it, and to either schedule tasks beforehand or do without them altogether.I started going for evening strolls, on my own, phone-less. I picked up painting again, which I\u2019d dropped for a few months. I started journaling a few minutes before bed. Most precious to me, I started to read again.In my teenage years I was an avid sci-fi\/fantasy reader, eating books up within days, if not hours. However, with the advent of Netflix, Instagram, and other easily-consumable entertainment, my reading time went way down. I knew it was happening, and I knew that I missed reading\u2026 but not enough to purposefully go back to it.But after the first few days of the no-screens rule, I found my old library card and checked out a ton of new books. I even discovered that I enjoy reading short stories as I searched for something quick and engaging to read in the hopes it would mimic Netflix, something I would never have known about myself if I\u2019d continued to use my phone just before bed.In short, when my normal distractions became unavailable to me, I rediscovered other things I used to love.Most people will be familiar with that sinking feeling when you contemplate waking up. It sucks to wake up. The only thing you want to do is go back to sleep, close your eyes, get a few more minutes of delicious, blessed unconsciousness in your warm bed.As a product of my no-screens rule, I started getting tired earlier. So I went to bed earlier, and when I went to bed, I was sleepier than normal. I don\u2019t have any actual data on my hours or quality of sleep, but I felt better. When 7 AM rolled around as it always does, I didn\u2019t spring out of bed, exactly, but it wasn\u2019t something I dreaded anymore. It was easier.Falling asleep was easier, too. I\u2019ve had some problems with mild insomnia, and until this month, my solution was to go online and read articles, or watch movies, or browse Twitter until I was sleepy. But now, I read books again. When I drifted off to sleep, I\u2019d be thinking about book plots, characters, and stories.I\u2019d actually expected to struggle more to get out of bed, because normally the first thing I do is look at my phone, hypothetically triggering blue light to wake me up. But either having to get out of bed to look at my phone, or the increased quality and quantity of sleep, or both, meant it was far easier than before.Back in December of last year, I made the then-radical choice to turn off my notifications. For everything. While it meant I missed the odd message from my friends and family, and I started having to check my socials manually, it also meant my phone become a more useful tool for me rather than something that would distract me. My general anxiety around performance on social media went way down. I didn\u2019t compare myself as often, and I stayed off my phone more.Sleep is something we spend an awful lot of time doing, and according to research, not very well. We don\u2019t know all the ramifications and health effects good or bad sleep has on us, but what we do know is that it\u2019s important.The intersection of technology with our basic functions is an area that hasn\u2019t been thoroughly plumbed yet \u2014 but my experience tells me it\u2019s more important than we know.This experiment changed my perspective on what I truly need to get by with technology. I used to think not being instantly available to anyone who needed me was bad, but in fact, it\u2019s helped me. I used to think I couldn\u2019t possibly exist without my pre-bed screentime, but after this experiment, now I believe it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to permanently change my life for the better.Want my four-day email course on how to make money with Medium?Written byWritten by","13968":"What the past decade of glymphatic research tells us about sleep and its important implications for brain healthThe brain: whether you give it credit or not, the soft gelatinous mass floating in your skull is responsible for life as you know it. At this moment, your brain is simultaneously maintaining your breathing and heart rate, while turning these black squiggles on a screen into coherent words and thoughts.The brain is a workhorse and a hungry one at that. While accounting for approximately 2% of the average adult\u2019s weight, it accounts for 20% of its energy consumption, more than any other organ.Go ahead and give your brain a mental compliment and then think about how meta that was.Fascinated yet? You\u2019re not alone. Neuroscience research is booming. Growing interest and funding for neuroscience research has given rise to a burgeoning field of interdisciplinary neuroscience that ranges from clinical studies in neurodegenerative and behavioral disorders to basic science studies characterizing brain structure and function at the molecular level\u2013 and all this is for good reason.In 2014, just nine common neurological diseases (Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, chronic lower back pain, stroke, TBI, migraines, epilepsy, MS, TSCI, and Parkinson\u2019s) were estimated to cost the American people almost 800 billion dollars, a number that has only increased over time. And despite the abundance of sensationalist reporting that might suggest otherwise, there is currently no panacea for a sick brain.Yet the research does suggest that quality sleep, among other factors, generally improves brain health and we\u2019re only just starting to understand why.Sleep is quite mysterious. Even today, we aren\u2019t completely sure about the true evolutionary function of sleep. Yet surely, it must be important as most mammals die after more than a week of complete sleep-deprivation. So what is really going on behind the scenes?With the exception of a few brief exciting and oftentimes bizarre dreams in REM sleep, our experience of sleep seems rather boring. While Drake and friends may think they are \u2018out like a light\u2019 when they fall asleep, the light is, in fact, still very much on. The \u201csleeping\u201d brain is still firing, sending electrochemical signals and using lots of energy, particularly during REM sleep.Previously, sleep research relied heavily on measuring electrical activity on the surface of the brain using EEG or measuring blood flow using fMRI. These tools are popular because they are non-invasive, but they lack the detail that would come from looking at a brain sample after death.The advances in newer methods such as two-photon microscopy allow highly-penetrant, in-vivo imaging in a precise focal plane. In other words, you can look through the skull to observe microscopic brain structures in alive, sleeping subjects in real-time. How neat is that?These methods have allowed sleep researchers to make some truly breathtaking discoveries, but before you get woke to some to these rousing findings, let\u2019s take time to review some relevant Neurophysiology 101.In an elegantly-designed experiment published in 2012, scientists injected a fluorescent tracer into the CSF of mice to follow its flow. Interestingly, the tracer appeared to be following the network of arteries carrying fresh blood to the brain.However, the tracer wasn\u2019t in the arteries, just around them. What they eventually found was that the CSF was flowing in the space between the outer walls of the arteries and the surrounding glial cells. If you can imagine putting a smaller pipe into a larger pipe, allowing two distinct fluids to flow in parallel along the same network, you\u2019ve begun to understand periarterial flow.In addition to the pressure gradient that keeps the fluid moving, the pulses of blood in your arteries also help push the CSF along.This CSF moves into the water surrounding cells, or interstitial fluid, and washes over them, delivering nutrients and clearing away harmful cellular waste products. It then travels through perivenous spaces, which surround veins, to be dumped into lymphatic vessels where the waste is filtered out.This, in short, is the glymphatic (glial lymphatic) system and it acts as the brain\u2019s sewer system. Surprisingly, it was discovered just seven years ago by Dr. Maiken Nedergaard\u2019s group at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Perhaps the most interesting quirk about the glymphatic system is that it is only active during sleep. The perivascular tunnels are tightened during wakefulness, limiting CSF flow; this change is likely mediated by norepinephrine, a neuromodulator that is abundant only in wakefulness.Several studies have shown that as you sleep, the glymphatic system is clearing your brain of neurotoxic substances that have accumulated throughout the day, including amyloid-beta, the protein that forms the characteristic plaques in Alzheimer\u2019s. In a vicious cycle, impaired glymphatic function increases the accumulation of amyloid-beta, which in turn limits CSF influx through the glymphatic system.And indeed glymphatic efficiency is impaired in the brains of current models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and generalized aging, although the possibility of a causal relationship presents a less-clear, chicken-or-egg-first type of question.Fortunately, more people are coming around to the idea that sleep is not a luxury. There is strong evidence for how sleep affects learning, obesity, hypertension, insulin sensitivity, and you don\u2019t need a peer-reviewed article to tell you that sleep affects your mood.For many young people, not getting enough sleep is no longer a humblebrag for an industrious work ethic, but rather a mark of neglect for one\u2019s well-being. Yet, while surveys suggest that Americans are getting slightly more weekday sleep than in previous years, only 10% of respondents said they prioritize sleep over fitness, work, or their hobbies.Good hygiene comes in many different forms. Regularity in keeping your hair, teeth, sheets, and home clean are (hopefully) already part of your routine.It just might be time to add your brain to that list.Written byWritten by","14167":"Why do we keep doing this to ourselves \u2014 replacing naturally delicious foods like butter with synthetic, inferior substitutes in the misguided belief that they are better for us?Let us not mince words. Spreads and margarines are heinous crimes against all that is good and decent in this world. Even so, that hasn\u2019t stopped entire populations from making the switch from better-tasting butter.Margarine was invented in 1869 by a French food chemist called Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e9s in response to the offer of a prize from Louis Napoleon III to anyone who could make a cheap substitute for pricey butter to feed the lower classes and the armed forces. M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e9s\u2019s concoction was a far cry from margarine today, being made from beef suet, ground-up sheep\u2019s stomach and chopped cows\u2019 udder.Still, it was a lot more wholesome than the margarines and spreads on offer today.Once butter became cheaper, the marketing angle pursued by the purveyors of this mash-up changed from cheapness to healthiness. Margarine was blended with vegetable oils, and in what was considered a breakthrough at the time, but which we now know to be an unmitigated public health disaster, the hydrogenation of vegetable oils was pioneered. Monster margarine was spawned.It seemed a good idea at the time: vegetable oils could be made hard like butter just by adding hydrogen atoms, and to do so was cheaper than using beef suet. The partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils, a process that creates trans fatty acids, has serious implications for human health, in particular cardiovascular health, mainly because of the way trans fats increase platelet aggregation (clumping of proteins in blood). This can lead to clots. So dangerous are these trans fats that many countries have banned the use of hydrogenation and partial hydrogenation in food processing.A total ban came into effect in the US in 2018. In the EU, it\u2019s up to the individual country. The UK still has no such ban in place, even though:\u201cThe UK government is being urged to completely wipe out industrially-produced trans fats from the food chain after the World Health Organization warned they kill up to half a million people around the world every year.\u201d (Telegraph)Since the general public got wind of the harmful trans fats that are created during the hydrogenation process, most processed food manufacturers have voluntarily ended this practice. Instead, they use a process called interesterification, which involves the deployment of enzymes to treat vegetable oil at high temperatures to make it more solid.Is interesterification safe? We don\u2019t know, because few studies have investigated its safety, and those that have suggest that the process may have potentially adverse effects on fat metabolism and blood sugar control. So a possibly hazardous procedure is carried out on a staple food consumed by millions every day, and has never been adequately tested for safety.No, not really.Margarines and spreads are usually produced from omega-6 polyunsaturated oils (sunflower seed, soya bean, corn) but may also be made from monounsaturated oils such as olive oil.These once-natural oils are processed to within an inch of their lives, in a series of high temperature refinements, that involve degumming, bleaching and deodorisation.The effect of the deodorisation process is to create trans fatty acids, albeit in smaller amounts than the process of hydrogenation. That\u2019s right \u2014 those trans fatty acids we thought we had seen the back of have returned through the back door. Because these trans fats are produced only during the refinement of the oil, there is no legal requirement for them to appear on the list of ingredients.At this stage both the flavour and colour of margarine are somewhat unpalatable, so the product has to be \u2018corrected\u2019. Flavourings and colour are added, to make it look and taste more like butter. Vitamins A and D are added to compensate for the absence of nutrients and as a statutory requirement.Does the end-product even taste like butter? For the love of God, that is the least we should expect. But of course it doesn\u2019t. UK readers of a certain age may remember that in the 60s and 70s, television adverts featured housewives in a supermarket, uniformly astonished to discover that they couldn\u2019t tell the difference between Stork margarine and butter.Nobody was convinced. Yet instead of sliding into obscurity \u2014 a fate it surely deserved \u2014 margarine evolved into The Spread.A spread is a margarine spin-off, containing less fat and more water.The composition of margarine is defined by law under The Spreadable Fats (Marketing Standards) Regulations, 1995. Margarine must have a fat content of not less than 80 per cent but less than 90 per cent. A spread contains less fat, usually 25%-75%. In the absence of fat, it is bulked out with water. It\u2019s a watery vegetable oil, for which people happily pay a premium.The olive oil used in these spreads has undergone the same refinement process as other vegetable oils. It is a world apart from the cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil so beloved of the people of Mediterranean countries. What\u2019s more, these spreads are usually blended with other refined oils, such as sunflower and canola.Pure butter is an entirely natural product, and even more so when made from the milk of free-range, pasture-fed dairy cows. It is true that some natural foods, notably butter, contain some trans fatty acids, but these have different chemical structures to their industrially produced counterparts and are not alien to the human body. It is the artificial trans fats created during the hydrogenation and refinement processes that are no longer \u201cGenerally Recognized as Safe,\u201d by the US FDA.Made from soured, churned cream, butter contains health-promoting fatty acids, in particular butyric acid, from which butter takes its name. Butyric acid is also created via the fermentation of fibre by bacteria in the gut. It regulates colon immunity and reduces inflammation in the gut. It helps the friendly bacteria L. acidophilus and B. bifidum to stick to the digestive tract and resist harmful bugs that might attempt to take up residence. Butyric acid is known to block colon tumour cells and at the same time promote healthy colon cells.Butter is a rich source of another fatty acid called conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). CLA is known to slow down and even prevent tumour development, and is the only fatty acid acknowledged by the National Academy of Sciences in the US to show consistent anti-tumour properties, even at very low levels. Furthermore,\u201cCLA decreases body fat storage in animal models and promotes cardiovascular protection against atherosclerosis.\u201d (Eynard & Lopez)Butter is the gift that keeps on giving, clearly. It is also naturally rich in vitamin A, unlike spreads and margarine, which have to be artificially fortified with this vitamin.But, you\u2019re thinking, isn\u2019t butter full of saturated fat, and doesn\u2019t saturated fat kill off people in droves? For more information on this moot point, see my article How eating more fat can improve your memory.In the meantime, I recommend that you purchase a stoneware butter dish. Then you can dispense with the fridge on summer days and enjoy your own spreadable, heavenly-tasting, health-giving butter.Written byWritten by","14227":"\u201cYoga is the journey of the self, through the self, to the self.\u201d \u2014 The Bhagavad Gita.The secret of yoga isn\u2019t in the deepest backbend. It\u2019s not in the perfect downward dog. There\u2019s no secret in the longest-held \u201cohm.\u201d The secret of yoga is in the things you teach yourself through repeated visits to your mat. It\u2019s the practice of uncovering the wisdom of your soul.Here are a few lessons you can learn if you show up and listen closely.Sometimes your yoga teacher will go nuts. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to hold Chair pose until it becomes simply unreasonable. You\u2019ll breeze past \u201cthis has got to be over soon\u201d into demented joke territory.Pause. Grit your teeth. Remember that you carry within you an unshakable strength. You have titanium thighs. You can choose to stick it out, to marvel at your ability to stay upright.Whether it feels like it or not, you have a say in how you react to discomfort. Every. Time. But, simply put, pain hurts. It\u2019s easy to attach to our struggles. Yoga shows us the power of our minds. We can learn to see hardship as an opportunity to celebrate strength.Momentary discomforts and challenges on the yoga mat prepare you to respond with a more open heart to larger discomforts and challenges in your life off the mat.The prescription for resilience? Lean in when it hurts.I practiced yoga for years before I learned I should activate my thighs in Upward Dog. This took the brunt of the move off my upper body and spread it more evenly from head-to-toe. It was a game-changer in my form and my confidence.Years later, I learned to look slightly forward, rather than down, in Chaturanga. The shift in perspective lifted my shoulders and opened my heart \u2014 it infused the movement with an ease that had been patiently waiting for me to find it. I savored my tiny victory.Similarly, I\u2019ve taken to celebrating the small wins in life. Often, it\u2019s tackling the petty challenges anxiety creates (once, it took me two months to brave making coffee at a new job). Your small win might be petting a dog, pressing \u201csubmit,\u201d or taking a breath instead of lashing out. Whatever it is, it\u2019s your win. Celebrate it!These are the small adjustments that deepen the practice of living an empowered life. They are the simple, profound discoveries waiting for you to take notice.We are masters of comparison. It feels natural. Of course, the best gauge of our own success is the success of others. Right? Yoga offers up gentle lesson: if your eyes are on everyone else\u2019s headstands, you won\u2019t stay upright long in your own.Being the best yogi isn\u2019t important; showing up for your practice is. When you return to your mat over and over again, you start to discover what you\u2019re meant to discover \u2014 what your soul is hungry to teach you. It won\u2019t be the same as someone else\u2019s. And it probably won\u2019t be about touching your toes.Off the mat, you\u2019ll make mistakes. You\u2019ll care about something, and you\u2019ll fail. Or someone else will do it better.You\u2019ll still care.So, show up \u2014 again and again. You\u2019ll grow towards your unique purpose if you allow it.Focus inward, on your own goals, your own wins. Keep practicing.In yoga, backbends and heart-openers like Camel pose and Wheel pose require you to be entirely exposed, with your heart literally bared to the world. When you leave the pose your heart is racing. It\u2019s a primal thing.You\u2019ve allowed yourself to be vulnerable\u2026 and lived.The world has a lot of sharp edges. It can be hard to trust. Turning inward \u2014 curling away from what might hurt you \u2014 is a reasonable response. The problem is, protecting your heart from pain can also shield it from joy.So, on the yoga mat, we practice. We throw our heads back and leave our chests and necks unprotected in a room full of suspiciously zen strangers. And we live. We do it again. And we live some more.Then, somewhere down the line, life asks us to take a chance on something meaningful \u2014 and we\u2019re ready for action. We\u2019re afraid, but we act anyway.Truth: sometimes being vulnerable can hurt you, but you\u2019ll live. Showing up with an open heart is your only responsibility.Repeat after me: sometimes you struggle.Some days you can\u2019t touch your toes. Some days you can. Some days you\u2019re perfectly centered, made of natural grace. Some days your mind takes the wheel. Remember that embarrassing thing from sixth grade? Other days you\u2019re just wickedly clumsy.Your yoga practice doesn\u2019t look the same every day. It can\u2019t. You\u2019re a different person every time you step foot on your mat. You\u2019ve experienced different aches. You\u2019ve been nourished from different sources. With practice, you let go of what you think you should be capable of at any given moment.You just show up. You practice.Off the mat, some days you just need a break. This doesn\u2019t cancel out all the time you\u2019ve spent barreling towards glory. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. Learning to observe and honor where your body is at on the mat helps you be aware of, and gentle towards, the state of your soul. You learn to give yourself what you need without judgment. You learn to be a little kinder to you.Which leads me to the last, and most important, lesson of all:You got this.Written byWritten by","14286":"I live to perform for people.I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m an actor \u2014 though I\u2019d love to be. I\u2019m not a comedian or a radio personality. What I mean is that when I\u2019m with people, I\u2019m always playing a part.The role I play depends on the group I\u2019m with. Sometimes I\u2019m the uptight, organized know-it-all. Sometimes I\u2019m the extroverted, charming princess. Sometimes I\u2019m the class clown. The bigger the crowd, the bigger my performance.The people I\u2019m most myself with are those I\u2019ve known the longest. My family knows who I am, of course. My partner of six years knows me. My childhood friends see through me.But even with them, I find I am putting on not an act, but a performance. I\u2019m not changing who I am, deep down, but simply playing up the parts I think will get the best reaction, the biggest laughs. I love it, but it\u2019s exhausting and it leaves me with the unsettling feeling of not knowing myself. Not really. Not deep down.It\u2019s that melancholy feeling when a party ends, when my friends go home when I\u2019m alone with myself and my thoughts for the first time all day. I run to put on a podcast, a Netflix show, to talk to my partner \u2014 anything but confront the vast space in me that is filled with personality when other people are around.For me, it\u2019s a catch-22: to be liked by others, I feel I need to showcase the parts of myself which will be most appreciated. But to love myself, I feel as though I shouldn\u2019t need to put on this show for others. Surely if I were just myself, people would still like me?Surely I would still like myself?It\u2019s spawned a few identity crises: who am I when I\u2019m not with people? Who am I when I\u2019m not performing? Who is Zulie, and what is she like?So I did what I always like to do when I run into problems like these: I google them.Google told me that if I wanted to know who I was when I wasn\u2019t with others, I needed to take myself out. Get to know myself. Date myself casually, with no promises made. Make time for myself, with no interruptions or distractions.I spend time on my own fairly frequently \u2014 I commute half an hour each way to work on my bicycle; I do grocery shopping on my own. I go for walks when I need story inspiration. But it\u2019s rare that I don\u2019t take some kind of distraction with me, or that I\u2019m alone with no ulterior motive. I listen to podcasts or music when I work out or go shopping, and when I\u2019m going on story-walks, it\u2019s with a specific end in mind.But there\u2019s a difference between being on my own, and spending time in my own company. And I wanted to find out who I was when there was nobody else around.I took myself out to dinner. No phone. No friends. No plan. Just me, out on the town, eating some food.What would people think? What if I got bored? What if some dude tried to chat me up? How on earth would I cope on my own for an hour and a half?True to my promise, I walked the fifteen minutes to the restaurant I showed up exactly on time for my reservation at a fancy restaurant in town. I was dressed nicely, with my hair half-up. I clutched my bag as I anxiously waited for the waiter to take me to my table, and started scanning the menu as soon as I sat down. I chose my starter and entree and requested a glass of white wine \u2014 a rare indulgence for a perennial tap water drinker as myself.Honestly, it took me a while to relax and unwind, enjoying the atmosphere and rather than searching for a distraction. I spent the first fifteen minutes while I waited for my starter continually patting in my purse to check for my phone. But eventually, I let myself be distracted organically by doing what people have done since the dawn of time: people watch.There was a couple on a first date next to me. Nearby, a table full of raucous old ladies uproariously laughed. A young family sat behind me \u2014 their little girl ran up to my shiny bag and picked it up with both hands, eyes wide. I took mental notes on what I imagined their conversations were, picked up from overheard snippets.When my starter arrived (the best French onion soup I\u2019ve ever had), I fully committed myself to the food: I smelled it, inhaling the Frenchy, oniony aroma, nearly nourishing in and of itself. Each spoonful was a salty delight. I\u2019ve had French onion soup before, but never as my main occupation. In the past, I\u2019ve always been distracted \u2014 with my partner, phone, television, book. It was wonderful to discover that the flavors were so complex that they needed no accompaniment.I made my way through the next two courses, enjoying every mouthful, keeping an eye on the folks around me, and staying, despite myself, quite entertainedAll in all, it turns out I\u2019m pretty good company. I keep myself entertained with witty commentary on the world around me, even if I\u2019m the only one who laughs. I\u2019m kind to others who approach me, even if there\u2019s nobody to see it. And I have a genuine and abiding curiosity about the people whose lives I only tangentially touch. I want to know more about their story.It\u2019s a big question. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think ninety minutes of being alone would be enough to give me a definitive answer to that age-old question, frankly. But it was enough to have a break from the expectations of others, a break from jumping through the hoops I imagine they need to like me.It will take more than one dinner on my own to break the habits of a lifetime. But it\u2019s enough to take the first step \u2014 knowing a little bit more about myself outside of the context of others. I\u2019m a little more secure in spending time on my own, and a little less afraid of boredom.I\u2019m funny and intelligent and kind and forgiving. It matters less what other people think of me. And that\u2019s worth the price of a solo dinner.Want my free four-day email course on making money by writing on Medium?Written byWritten by","14328":"To date, it\u2019s been the most popular piece of content I\u2019ve written for Medium, or anyplace for that matter. It\u2019s gotten more interest than I had anticipated it would: there\u2019s a \u201ck\u201d on the end of the number of views.\u201cEating \u2018Healthy\u2019 Destroyed Me\u201d is a story that spans the majority of my life so far. From age thirteen to twenty-three I was a vegetarian, which was both a cover for and an encouragement of my eating disorder. I still ate food and I didn\u2019t binge it, but my diet became so restrictive that for years I wasn\u2019t consuming enough calories or micro nutrients. My body went into starvation mode. My health crumbled. Guided by wellness blogs, I obsessed over everything I put in my mouth. I loved food, I hated food, I was scared of food.I wrote that piece partly for myself, to review and hopefully close that chapter of my life. But it was also written to inform, to warn and to connect with other people.I am very grateful I seem to have succeeded in both of these goals, but particularly the latter. Many comments have been encouraging. My years of disordered eating were alienating and the resounding cheers of \u201cYou are not alone!\u201d that followed the publication of this piece were deeply comforting.But more than that I\u2019ve appreciated the anonymous views. My hope is that the people who need my piece will find it, so that they know they are not alone and things can change.However, the internet is not all nice. The majority of the feedback I received has been positive\u2026but some of it isn\u2019t. People are entitled to their opinion of my work. I\u2019ve no grudge against that. But it was the tone, intensity and uniformity of the dissenting views that stung. Then I noticed a pattern. It\u2019s been five months since I published \u201cEating \u2018Healthy\u2019 Destroyed Me\u201d and there seems to be a trend in what those who disagree with me have to say.The message seems to boil down to: You\u2019re doing it wrong. You didn\u2019t try hard enough. I know how you should be eating.Ironically (or perhaps not) those are the very sentiments that led me to the place of deprivation, starvation and depression.Perhaps I did not make it clear enough in my first article: I am doing the best that I have ever done in my entire life.The way I live now \u2014 as an omnivore with a deep appreciation for fruits, vegetables and whole foods \u2014 is working really well. My mind is the clearest it has ever been. I have muscle on my bones now, and for the first time in my life I can truly feel the potential for increased strength. Recently, I started running, which seemed like a fanciful aspiration before. Because of my increased energy, I am able to start investing more time in things I care about, like sustainable agriculture. Perhaps most importantly, food doesn\u2019t rule my life. Food is part of my life but I don\u2019t spend hours every day planning my next meal. When I go out with friends or my husband, I am able to be present with them, instead of fretting over the uncontrolled meal I\u2019m about to consume. When we go to friends\u2019 homes and they offer dessert, I eat it, I am thankful and feel no guilt.From everything I\u2019ve heard, food is supposed to be life-giving. It wasn\u2019t until I let go of my first dietary restriction \u2014 no meat \u2014 that I was able to begin to relate to food as a positive, restorative substance. And then it began to restore me.And all of them were pretty vicious.Several of the commentators promoted veganism specifically. I was briefly vegan, yes, and vegetarian for a longer period of time. And I gave it a solid go. I tracked my food, I supplemented with a B complex and carefully selected protein. For about a year, I worked hard to get enough plant-based protein in me, partly by way of a high quality vegan protein powder. Yet when I started eating meat again, that is when I finally began to thrive. This is clear if you read to the end of the article.But I was bombarded with information and links about why my omnivore diet was damaging on multiple fronts.And I don\u2019t disagree with all of it. Yet for the foreseeable future, I\u2019ll continue eating meat.I truly believe I need animal protein. Every human body functions differently. I\u2019ve tried living off of only plant-based protein. That led me to depression, fatigue and thoughts of suicide.So I\u2019ll be eating meat but my goal is to eventually be consuming only animal products that are in line with my ethics. I\u2019d like to be raising my own chickens and quail, and occasionally consuming rabbit raised and dispatched of with care by my younger brother. I\u2019m investigating local, ethical, grass-fed sources for some occasional beef and pork. I\u2019m learning about how to use the whole beast. I guess that means I may eventually try blood sausage or hog maw\u2026Vegans, I commend you. But for some reason my body can\u2019t handle that lifestyle.This could be genetic. My mother and her sister have a gene abnormality that I am still wrapping my head around, but it appears to effect how and even if the body can use folate and B vitamins. I\u2019m going to get tested soon.I\u2019m also trying to not strain my body; I want to care for it. I need enough energy to be able to exercise, not least of all because there\u2019s a strong, scary history of thyroid disease in my family. The only way to attempt to prevent this, I\u2019m told, is to stay fit. For me, animal protein has equaled energy, which has equaled more rigorous physical activity, which is equaling a better life.Interestingly, these missives have disappeared, but you can see screenshots of them below.The commentators in these situations aggressively and personally berated me. In no uncertain terms, they made it clear that they saw me as stupid and ignorant because I had had a difficult relationship with food and eating. One commentator focused on my age, another person attacked my mental abilities and essentially said I would forever be cursed.I\u2019m almost not sure where to begin.I didn\u2019t choose this story. I didn\u2019t choose my eating disorder and I didn\u2019t choose to be born in a time and place where women\u2019s bodies are frequently critiqued. When this started, I was a child. I was thirteen years old when I became a vegetarian, and even younger when the seeds of these struggles were sown (which is clear if you read the article thoroughly). The adults in my life did not assist me in a relevant way. As I\u2019ve matured, I\u2019ve sought help. It\u2019s worked. I\u2019m doing better. But I am human; I constantly dance with imperfection.The above comments hurt but I can take it.What worries me is that those commentators truly believe the things they say and they are out in the world, making their voices heard in little and perhaps large ways. Are they, right now, shaming someone \u2014 a sibling, a grandchild, a stranger \u2014 for having conflicted feelings about food and\/or their body? I know the power of one comment, one dirty look. It can shake you to your core. One comment can cause a world of harm.All I have to say to these commentators: Please, don\u2019t criticize what you can\u2019t understand.But I refuse to shame people with diets and lives different from my own. Are your vitals good? Do you feel content and well? Can you function daily? Are you being a good human to your fellow humans? Are you doing what you are capable of doing to care for planet Earth and all its inhabitance? Yes? Good. Carry on!There is no One Right Way. There are 7.6 million different human bodies, all with unique needs and ways of operating. There is one thing that is the same for all of them though: they are all deserving of kindness, care and health, in whatever form that takes.Written byWritten by","14352":"I used to be very overweight, and the extra weight did terrible things to my self-confidence.

Cutting out my favorite foods just made me feel guilty, and I would feel terrible about myself when I thought about enjoying ice cream or a cookie. \u201cSuperfoods\u201d didn\u2019t help either because I didn\u2019t really like the taste of goji berries or bee pollen \u2014 to me, these ingredients were difficult to obtain and difficult to use. So it should be of no surprise that after each new tactic, I would just quickly return to my unhealthy food choices, and I would go years without any progress on my health goals. I almost believed it would never happen for me.So it was surprising when the first time I made any actual progress on my goals, I was probably eating the most I had ever been. I was back in Japan during the summer, staying with my grandmother. I didn\u2019t have access to my usual \u201chealthy\u201d snacks or diet meals, and instead was eating whatever my grandmother served me. She loved loved loved to feed us, and would always bring home new ingredients she found at the market, cook with it, and serve it to us. Grilled kabocha and green pepper with sesame salt, Japanese yam with sesame-soy dipping sauce, steamed spinach with dried katsuo in a ponzu sauce \u2014 every night it was something new and delicious.I would finish every meal very full and very satisfied, so it came as a big surprise to me when I found that I had dropped some weight during the summer. My clothes felt a looser, my stomach was a little less rounder. What happened? There was no counting calories, no measuring of macros. I ate what I wanted and when I wanted \u2014 what were these strange foods my grandmother was feeding me? Was she secretly sneaking superfoods into my meals? No, not exactly.I was eating more, but I was eating whole, nutrient-dense, plant-based foods. I realized that the better way to focus on eating healthily is not being worried about what we should be cutting out of our diet, but really what we should be adding in. And not just adding in sprinkles of magic bullet superfoods, but adding in whole, nutrient dense, filling, and tasty vegetables \u2014 and a lot of it!Coming home, I decided that I would continue to incorporate a lot of vegetables into my diet, and I would eat as much of it as I wanted to. I would eat it without worrying about carbs, about whether it was raw, steamed, baked or pan-fried, or if it was in a sauce or a side dish. The goal was just to eat more vegetables, until I felt full, nourished, and satisfied.But I\u2019m not my grandmother, and I don\u2019t know how to cook with 200 different kinds of vegetables and make them taste amazing like she can. So instead of trying to figure out how to work with so many new and different ingredients, I decided that I would focus on eating more of one kind of vegetable, one that I really enjoyed eating, and just add it to everything. I\u2019d toss it in pasta, fried rice, salads, ramen, sandwiches, rice balls, or eat it plain. Instead of over-eating, I learned to feel satiated by relying on eating more of this vegetable. Nutrient-dense, filling, delicious, and helped me lose weight \u2014 Edamame became my superfood.I really love edamame. I still add it to many of my dishes if I get the chance. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s in rice, noodles, or bread, Japanese or Western food, hot or cold. Here are a few ways I add edamame into my diet:Edamame is an excellent source of soy protein, plant fiber, antioxidants, folate, and vitamin K. Its health benefits include the potential to help lower cholesterol, stabilize blood sugar, and reduce the risk of heart disease. It can help to boost your metabolism, transform your skin, and improve your mood. On more practical terms, it\u2019s also amazing because it fills me up, I feel good when I eat it, and it\u2019s delicious.And it\u2019s not that I eat a ridiculous amount of edamame because it\u2019s an actual \u201csuperfood\u201d. You should not be surprised to also find out that edamame is not the only food to have these health benefits \u2014 if you Google other green vegetables like broccoli, spinach, peas, kale, or brussel sprouts, these vegetables will also include similar health benefits.For me, real superfoods should be 2 things:Both points are equally important, that it is healthy but also delicious, because food is a source of love, culture, and community. To contribute to a healthier well-being, it must be nutritious, but also delicious so we can incorporate into our lives in such a way that it brings us joy. I\u2019m forever grateful to have reached a point where my relationship with food now encompasses this. While eating 200 different kinds of vegetables, prepared in 1000 different ways, is not really practical for most of us, we can achieve a healthier and more balanced diet by simply adding more whole foods that we enjoy, to the meals that we already know and love.For those who have a difficult relationship with eating healthily, instead of trying to cut down your pasta or bread intake, consider adding or doubling the amount of broccoli you put in the sauce. Or maybe you want to add some more peas. Or spinach. Or mushrooms. Or peppers. Or tomatoes. Instead of being concerned with eating less, cutting out your favorite foods, or eating the healthiest ingredients prepared in the healthiest way possible, discover what whole foods you enjoy, what ingredients taste good, and eat more of it. Eat well, feel full, and love the food you put into your body!If you\u2019re still convinced no such ingredient exists for you, send me an email at kokumura@kakikata.space and I will give you tips on how to cook vegetables so they taste so delicious you\u2019ll want to prepare it again and again.If this article was any use to you, please leave a comment or email me at kokumura@kakikata.space!

Unless you want to pay the bill!\u201dOn the parental side of things, it is nearly impossible to sit there and listen as hundreds of dollars go down the drain, literally. However, the shower is a place which is crucial to mental health, especially among teenagers, and limiting the time spent there is largely counter-intuitive.From my own experience(and likely yours as well), I have dealt with a myriad of problems and situations in the shower. That ranges from acting out an interaction with a teacher or a boss to planning that next joke to say when hanging around friends. On a more serious note, shower time is a time for reflection, and is a brilliant way to reduce stress and anxiety levels after a day of going non-stop at school or work. The physical nature of shower or bath is scientifically proven to reduce tension and relax one\u2019s body and mind \u2014 and the extent of this is not to be underestimated, primarily among financially worried parents.From my own perspective, it appears that limiting a child\u2019s time in the shower might actually be less financially(and emotionally) viable than letting shower sessions run their own course. Less time to recover mentally and physically only means more susceptibility to illness and disease, especially among young children and teenagers. Even if one has an extensive medical insurance plan, those co-pays do add up.Also, \u201cinvestment\u201d into a child\u2019s shower time can also prevent much larger issues down the line. An inability for adolescents to learn how to manage certain mental health problems could lead to years of high costs for therapy, and beyond the financial burden of this, could be a drag on a family or simply inhibit the child\u2019s success or happiness later in life. Mental health issues are scarily on the rise among teenagers- 1 in 5 face a serious disorder- not to mention the majority who cope with still-significant forms of anxiety, depression, or other conditions.Showers also pose an opportunity for growth and learning in the field of creativity, as that period of tranquility welcomes fresh thoughts and new takes on certain challenges one may have. From personal experience, the majority of my ideas for articles have come to mind in the shower(this one as well), and shower time usually gives me that extra bit of calmness to finish an assignment or project which my mind had bailed out on as my anxiety levels rose. In other words, the shower actually helps kids do their homework, and shouldn\u2019t be deemed merely a waste of money.On a broader note, giving free range to children to manage their own shower time(or other basic things like laundry, cooking, or cleaning) grants kids the chance to learn how to use their time wisely and also to understand basic necessities. Maybe kids might start to appreciate all that money you spend on water bills without you screaming it at them, or begin to become more independent at a younger age in taking care of themselves(as scary as this may seem).So, to all the parents out there, let your kids take that extra five minutes \u2014 it is far more important than you think.Written byWritten by","14580":"So it wasn\u2019t enough to notice the fine lines, crows feet, and your sagging jawline in the mirror every morning.

But what precisely are the effects of these measures, and what do we do next?What Is Leaky Gut?The digestive system consists of many organs, including the large and small intestines, which collectively break down food, absorb nutrients and water, and remove waste products. \u201cLeaky gut\u201d describes a malfunctioning of the intestinal wall, which normally provides an essential barrier between your gut and the rest of your body to prevent harmful substances from entering your body.The intestinal wall contains small gaps, called tight junctions, which allow water and nutrients to pass through while blocking the passage of unwanted materials. When the single-cell mucosal lining of the intestine is irritated, these tight junctions loosen, causing a breakdown of the mucosal surface of the small intestine. This makes the intestine hyper-permeable, so it allows unwanted microbes and substances \u2014 such as bacteria, toxins, partially digested food, and allergens \u2014 to pass into the bloodstream.Leaky gut syndrome is a serious condition linked to various health problems, including autoimmune diseases, autism, migraines, food sensitivities, skin conditions, thyroid disease, chronic fatigue, and brain fog.What Causes Leaky Gut?Anything that can alter intestinal permeability can lead to leaky gut. One is a protein called zonulin. When zonulin is produced, it causes the tight junctions of the gut wall to open. Two factors that trigger the release of zonulin are bacterial imbalance in the intestines (called dysbiosis), and gluten.Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye that can stimulate the overproduction of zonulin, thus contributing to intestinal permeability. Even individuals who do not have celiac disease \u2014 an immune reaction to eating gluten \u2014 can be susceptible to gluten-induced inflammation and the resulting leaky gut.Other common causes of leaky gut are:Conditions Underlying Leaky Gut SyndromeDysbiosis is a key condition underlying leaky gut. Dysbiosis refers to imbalance in the bacteria within the body, most often the gastrointestinal tract. It\u2019s important to understand that dysbiosis is not so much about the microbes themselves but about their harmful effects when they\u2019re out of balance. Any instability in your gut flora can compromise your body\u2019s natural defense mechanisms against disease. The more dysbiosis you have, and the longer you have it, the greater the likelihood that it will lead to increased intestinal permeability and systemic issues.Dysbiosis can arise from any of the following:Consequences of Leaky GutWhen toxins and harmful microbes are released into our bloodstream, they trigger inflammation and stimulate an immune reaction. As they spread, they can damage cells throughout the body, impairing the functioning of our vital organs, including the brain. If a leaky gut is not healed, continuous inflammation results throughout the body, often leading to the development of secondary inflammatory conditions in various organ systems.Common consequences of leaky gut include the following:CognitiveDigestiveSystemicA Special Note on Autoimmune ConsequencesThe immune system exists to prevent infection from dominating and destroying the body. When a leaky gut allows bacteria, large food particles, environmental debris, and other unfamiliar materials into the bloodstream, the immune system goes into action, causing serious inflammatory activity. This can have negative consequences for various tissues, such as the joints, brain, thyroid, skin, and the gut lining itself. One very serious consequence is autoimmunity \u2014 when the body\u2019s own defense system turns against it.Leaky gut has been linked to several autoimmune-based diseases, including:Leaky Gut Healing Protocol: The 5R ProgramIn functional medicine, we use the \u201c5R\u201d program. When applied to leaky gut, the 5R approach can lead to dramatic improvements, repairing the gut and sometimes leading to complete healing of other chronic conditions caused by leaky gut.The 1st R: RemoveRemove stressors that irritate the intestinal tract and trigger an immune response, causing inflammation and increasing the levels of pro-inflammatory and pathogenic bacteria. Reduce or eliminate:The 2nd R: ReplaceReplace your digestive secretions. This means adding back essentials such as digestive enzymes, hydrochloric acid, and bile acids. These are required for proper digestion but can be compromised by medications, diet, diseases, aging, and other factors. Eating anti-inflammatory foods such as leafy greens, turmeric, and ginger will also help reintroduce healthy and diverse bacteria into your gut, replacing pathogenic bacteria. These foods contain polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, and antioxidant properties and provide neurological and cardiovascular protection. Polyphenols reduce the risk of disease in the intestine and increase the abundance and diversity of gut bacteria, helping prevent and treat gastrointestinal (GI) disorders.The following foods are easy to digest and can help replace your digestive secretions as well as repair the intestinal lining:Bone broth contains the amino acids proline and glycine, which are essential building blocks for repairing damaged intestinal lining. Bone broth also contains collagen, which helps form connective tissue and seals the mucosal lining of the GI tract, improving nutrient absorption. Supplementing your diet with collagen or gelatin is important because these can help boost your gastric juices and aid in restoring the integrity and health of your mucosal lining. Drink 8\u201316 ounces of bone broth daily.Collagen can also be obtained through plants. Vitamins A and C work together to produce collagen in the body, so foods rich in these nutrients will naturally boost your collagen levels. Some of the most concentrated sources for both vitamin A and vitamin C are berries, citrus fruits, carrots, kale, mushrooms, and spinach.Coconut products are beneficial for healing your gut. The medium-chain fatty acids in coconut are easier to digest than other fats. Coconut kefir is especially helpful, as it also contains probiotics that support your digestive system.Cultured raw dairy products, such as kefir, contain probiotics to encourage the growth of healthy gut bacteria, and short-chain fatty acids, which can help heal the gut.Fermented vegetables contain organic acids and probiotics which grow and flourish in the body to help support the gut. Sauerkraut and kimchi are excellent sources.Fiber-rich foods support heathy digestion by regulating sugar absorption, promoting intestinal motility, cleaning the colon, and ensuring regular, healthy bowel movements.Fruits low in sugar, such as berries, contain antioxidants such as flavonoids and essential vitamin C, which are an easily digested form of fibre which helps to repair the digestive system. Consume 1\u20132 servings daily, preferably in the morning.Ginger reduces intestinal gas and inflammation and soothes the intestinal tract while promoting motility and increasing bile production.Healthy fats in moderation promote gut healing \u2014 for example, egg yolks, avocado, ghee, and coconut oil are all easy on the gut and help it repair.Omega-3 fats benefit a damaged gut and can be found in grass-fed beef, chia seeds, brussel sprouts, organic chicken, wild-caught alaskan salmon, seaweed and algae.Warming foods \u2014 for example, cooking soft-cooked vegetables in chicken broth \u2014 provide your gut bacteria with the prebiotic fibre they need to grow and do their jobs. Cooking and pureeing vegetables breaks them down, making them easier to digest.The 3rd R: ReinoculateProbiotics are beneficial bacteria found in the gut. Probiotics in the form of foods and supplements are often needed to help reestablish a balanced gut flora, also called the microbiome. This is called reinoculation.Recommended probiotic strains include:These strains have been shown to help modulate the immune system, ameliorate autoimmune conditions, and counteract gut infections. Aim to ingest 100 billion CFU (colony forming units) a day.Fermented foods \u2014 such as yogurt, miso, kimchi, and sauerkraut \u2014 are good sources of probiotics. But if you have SIBO or candida overgrowth, avoid these.You can also help beneficial bacteria flourish by consuming foods high in prebiotics, which are the foods that beneficial gut bacteria eat. Prebiotics are available in many foods containing a fiber called inulin, including artichokes, chicory, garlic, leeks, and onions. Another good prebiotic source is a supplement called \u201cfructo-oligosaccharide\u201d or FOS.The 4th R: RepairOne consequence of a malfunctioning gut is malnutrition, because key nutrients are not being absorbed in sufficient quantities. These include zinc, omega-3 supplements such as fish oil and the antioxidant vitamins A, C, D3, E, and K3. Using food and supplements to boost your intake of these nutrients is essential for gut repair.The most beneficial substances for repairing a leaky gut are: probiotics (described above), digestive enzymes, glutathione, l-glutamine, licorice root, and marshmallow root.Glutathione is an antioxidant that protects cells against inflammation, supports immunity, and assists with the regeneration of the gut lining and the blood\u2013brain barrier. It is also referred to as the master detoxifier, because all toxins stick onto glutathione, which then carries them into the bile, then the stool and out of your body. Chronic stress depletes glutathione. Glutathione-boosting foods include asparagus, avocado, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, garlic, kale, onions, and parsley. Liposomal Glutathione supplement is available in liquid form.Digestive enzymes ensure that foods are fully digested, decreasing the chance of partially digested foods particles and proteins damaging your gut wall. They are found naturally in the GI tract and are produced by good gut bacteria. Several factors can deplete your digestive enzymes, including digestive disease, liver disease, and the aging process. Ensuring you have enough can reduce gut inflammation and heal leaky gut. Take 1\u20132 capsules of enzymes at the beginning of each meal.L-glutamine is an essential amino acid. It acts as a protector, coating cell walls and repelling irritants. It is also the preferred food of some of the beneficial gut bacteria and is necessary for the growth and repair of your intestinal lining. Glutamine is one of the most versatile and abundant amino acids in the body. Research indicates that glutamine is vital for the production of white blood cells, which fight disease, and of molecules that aid with cell communication during an immune response and initiate cell movement to sites of trauma, infection, and inflammation. Glutamine supplements have been found to reduce the symptoms of intestinal hyper-permeability. Caution: some individuals do not metabolize l-glutamine well, so supplements can lead to elevated neuronal glutamine levels, which can damage or kill nerve and brain cells.Licorice root helps improve acid production in the stomach and supports the body\u2019s natural processes for maintaining the mucosal lining of the stomach and duodenum. This herb is beneficial if your leaky gut is caused by emotional stress because it can help improve the way you produce and metabolize the steroid cortisol. Clinical studies show that the rhizomes and roots of licorice have several healing effects, including anti-cancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as cardioprotective, neuroprotective, gastroprotective, and immunomodulatory effects. It can be taken as a tea or supplement. Caution: Licorice can cause edema and hypertension when taken in very large quantities.Slippery elm soothes the gut and throat, reduces acid reflux, and supports peristalsis throughout the digestive tract. It contains mucilage, which turns into a thick, slippery gel when wet. This helps to soothe and coat the digestive tract.Marshmallow root has antioxidant and antihistamine properties. It also forms a protective layer around GI cell junctions, making it an excellent addition for healing leaky gut. Marshmallow root coats the stomach and esophageal lining with protective mucilage. It also soothes inflamed intestines and supports the elimination of waste. Marshmallow root can be taken in powder, tea, or capsule form.The 5th R: RebalanceLifestyle choices play crucial roles in maintaining a healthy gut. Diet, alcohol, drugs, environmental factors, stress, sleep, and exercise all affect the health of the GI tract. When you have leaky gut syndrome, rebalancing all of these factors is important for healing. In addition to the dietary guidelines provided earlier in this article, implement the following to get yourself back in balance:Reduce stress: Chronic stress has been shown to harm beneficial gut bacteria. Negative changes in gut bacteria affect the brain, resulting in anxiety and depression. So it\u2019s important to engage in activities that put our minds at ease. Practicing meditation or yoga is one way to reduce stress and calm the fight-or-flight response, which prompts the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that disturb your microbiome. Also soothing are healing baths with magnesium flakes or Epsom salts. When stress levels are low, the microbiome can efficiently create anti-inflammatory compounds to heal a leaky gut.Sleep more: Lack of sleep can cause poor distribution of healthy gut bacteria, possibly resulting in increased intestinal permeability. Sleep deprivation also increases the production of inflammatory substances secreted by the immune system. Getting enough sleep decreases and prevents inflammation, halting the development of leaky gut as well as gastroesophageal reflux, IBS, liver disorders, and colorectal cancer.Exercise regularly: Physical activity enhances immune function and lowers cortisol levels, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Exercise can also increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, which are essential for healing leaky gut, maintaining a healthy microbiome and achieving overall well-being.This article is for informational and educational purposes only.

Most of us know it\u2019s healthy, so we suffer through it like we do any other chore. But we don\u2019t enjoy it. We grind our way through it,Evolutionarily, we depended on being able to run, lift, and swim. You\u2019d think we should love it, the way we do eating a good meal, or spending time with loved ones, both of which confer an evolutionary advantage.So why don\u2019t we?Physically, our bodies are loaded with features that make us good at running. We have heads that stay still when we run, short toes that need less energy to stabilize, the Achilles tendon built to store and release energy as we run.However, there\u2019s selection pressure against what our brains deem to be unnecessary exercise. When calories are scarce, like they were for the majority of our evolutionary history, anyone burning additional body mass was at a disadvantage. Cave-age folks who loved running for fun would spend unnecessary calories, making them less likely to survive and pass on their genes to the next generation.\u201cSome hunter-gatherers had diets of about 2,200 calories a day. When your energy intake is that low, you can\u2019t afford to go for a jog just for fun.\u201c \u2014 Daniel Lieberman, evolutionary biologist of Harvard.So our bodies are perfect for it, but we still hate running. Even though running\u2019s good for us, even though we know exercise makes us healthier, our brains have a hard time understanding And there\u2019s no way to force yourself to like it. Or so I used to think.This morning, I popped in my headphones, hopped into my running shoes, and jogged out the door. I could have taken the bus, but I was excited to go for my morning run to work and excited for the next episode of my latest podcast.This is coming from someone who has never liked to voluntarily exercise. But there I was, ponytail swinging and legs pumping, getting some morning fresh air and loving it.This is my experience with what scientists call temptation bundling: pairing a \u201cwant\u201d behavior with a \u201cshould\u201d behavior. In this case, the \u201cwant\u201d is to listen to my podcast. The \u201cshould\u201d is the running.Why this immediate reward work to encourage us to make healthier choices?By rewarding a delayed gratification activity such as going to the gym, healthy eating, or even doing taxes, with an immediate gratification \u201cguilty pleasure,\u201d which can be binging a trashy Netflix show, or a funny podcast, our brains learn to associate the immediate pleasure with the behavior we should be doing.For me, I found that listening to a story-based podcast, like My Dad Wrote a Porno, or a really gripping audiobook, like The Hunger Games or Gone Girlwhile running tricked my brain into thinking that by doing the exercise, I would get an immediate, stimulating reward.For yourself, think about what your \u201cshould\u201d behaviors are. Do you want to get better at saving money? Maybe you want to commit to cleaning the house for half an hour each day.Then pick what your \u201cwant\u201d behaviors. Is it drinking a really nice beverage? Do you love getting pedicures?The last step is to simply do them at the same time. Listen to your podcast while you clean the house. Drink an expensive glass of Chardonnay as you file your tax return.Personally, I found that wasn\u2019t enough \u2014 I had to restrict my access to the \u201cguilty pleasure.\u201d I only listen to that particularly funny podcast when I jog in to work \u2014 any other time, I listen to motivational, self-improvement podcasts like Optimal Living Daily.Researchers found that people were actually willing to pay to restrict their access to their guilty pleasure, in order to reward themselves for going to the gym, for example.Maybe there\u2019s a future gym which lets you borrow an iPod, pre-loaded with the best page-turners of the year \u2014 but only as long as you show up to exercise.Ultimately, temptation bundling immediately rewards our brain for doing activities we normally don\u2019t enjoy doing, but that gives us long term benefits. All we needed was a push in the right direction.Written byWritten by","14704":"When we first met our seniors at MICA, most of them told us the same thing- \u201cThis college will change you\u201d.This beautiful red-bricked campus which harbors the dreams and aspirations of many, throws the toughest of challenges at you, and you are left with no choice but to take up the gauntlet.

What\u2019s interesting is that around 98% of people reported having had at least one sexual fantasy, and that included asexuals (more than half of whom say they masturbate at least monthly).It turns out there are certain things that we tend to conjure in our imaginations more often than others. In his research on common sexual fantasies, Dr. Lehmiller found that seven things in particular kept coming up. So what are we all dirty daydreaming about?1. Multipartner sex.Yep, it appears as though the majority of us have at least entertained the idea of threesomes. For people in relationships, this fantasy usually involves their significant other (though not always). Interestingly, heterosexual-identifying men tend to prefer their imagined threesomes to be with two women, while heterosexual-identifying women generally didn\u2019t have a preference for which genders they were getting it on with.2. Power, control, and rough sex.Power dynamics aren\u2019t just about stroking the ego-they also make for some scintillating bedroom play while stroking, ahem, other things. Rough sex and BDSM involving spanking, hot wax, restraints, biting and other dominant\/submissive acts rated highly among research participants.3. Changing things up.Most of us like at least a little bit of variety in our lives. And it can help reignite a spark when sex in a long-term relationship becomes a little boring. Perhaps that\u2019s why so many people like to fantasize having sex with someone different, having sex in an unusual place, or even just having sex in a position you\u2019ve never tried before.4. Taboo or forbidden circumstances.Rulebreaking\u2014and the risk of getting caught\u2014is usually a bit of a thrill, no matter the context. And the adrenaline rush that comes with it can also heighten a sexual encounter significantly. But since there\u2019s of the risk of, you know, being arrested for things like public sex, it\u2019s understandable that people like to act out their desires for it in their fantasies. Preferred locales for such illicit encounters include parks, offices, beaches and elevators.5. Open relationships.Similar to the penchant for threesomes, a lot of people like to entertain the idea of opening up their relationship to include new partners\u2014with their significant other\u2019s permission, of course. (If you\u2019re considering making your fantasy a reality, our guide on how to have an open relationship may come in handy.) Other people favor the idea of being able to watch their partner have sex with someone else.6. Passion and romance.Turns out that sexual fantasies don\u2019t always need to be dirty. In fact, a lot of people simply fantasize about having meaningful sex that makes them feel desired (and good in bed). In some cases, people will also use the fantasy to \u2018improve\u2019 aspects of their body or sexual performance that they\u2019re not happy within real life.7. Same-sex encounters, gender-bending and erotic flexibility.As society in general becomes more aware of the fact that both gender and sexuality are nuanced spectrums, people are becoming more comfortable exploring their own sexuality. Heterosexual-identifying women in particular revealed that they often fantasize about sex with other women, and at least a quarter of heterosexual-identifying men surveyed said they fantasize about sex with other men or with a transgender woman.In his research, Dr. Lehmiller also discovered some pretty interesting facts about the intricacies of sexual fantasies and how they vary according to gender and sexual preference.Men, for example, are more likely to have fantasies that are quite explicit and involve multiple partners. What\u2019s more, they tend to focus on specific body parts-both their own, and those of their partner(s)-rather than merely on a sexual act. Overall, their imagined sexual escapades were mostly anchored in the physical.Women, on the other hand, are more inclined to focus on more emotional or romantic details like scene setting-like a beautiful beach, a moonlit evening, or a picturesque forest. Often there\u2019s also more of a build-up in their fantasies, like eyes meeting across the room, strolling along that beach, or getting caught in a rainstorm together. This is in line with the fact that women often need foreplay to help prepare their minds and bodies for the actual act of intercourse. These differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s fantasies seemed to be true regardless of sexual orientation.Another interesting insight? Women fantasize most frequently during ovulation, but their fantasies are often different during that time because it changes what women find attractive. Dr. Lehmiller also found that, for all genders, the content of our sexual fantasies tends to vary depending on our psychological state at the time. For example, when we are feeling insecure, our fantasies may involve circumstances that boost self-esteem, such as a narrative around independence or being sexually irresistible.Read more of Dr. Lehmiller\u2019s research on sexual fantasies.Originally published at getmaude.com.Written byWritten by","14877":"Everyone\u2019s story to sobriety is different. Some people got there because of severe, life threatening consequences. Some people got there after watching a family member suffer. Some people got there because of a medical diagnosis or a change in lifestyle. And some people (me) got there by accident.For the months leading up to my last drink I knew things weren\u2019t going well. My anxiety was at an all time high and I felt pretty awful. My hangovers were lasting longer and the symptoms were getting worse but I wasn\u2019t exactly sure that I was going to stop drinking. I knew something needed to change, but what?What is an alcoholic? How many drinks per week do you have to be an alcoholic? What is the criteria for AA? AA meetings nearby? Treatment for anxiety and alcohol? AA for women? Women who are alcoholics? Alcoholics who are high functioning? Alcoholics who don\u2019t think they are alcoholics? People who drink too much but who aren\u2019t alcoholics? People who would like to stop drinking? Celebrities that don\u2019t drink? How to become a mormon? Other religions that don\u2019t drink?I mean the list was insane, long, and led me nowhere. When I read the criteria for alcoholics I just didn\u2019t fit in. No, I hadn\u2019t lost my job. No, no one has told me I have a drinking problem. No, I have never stolen anything. No, I haven\u2019t put myself or my children in danger. No, I don\u2019t have a history of DUI or any kind of crime. No, I don\u2019t secretly hide my drinking. None of the criteria described me.It was maddening. I actually wanted the diagnosis. I prayed that one of those searches would list of the problems I was having. Alcoholism is a medical diagnosis. It is fixable. There are programs. There is help. Please, just someone tell me that yes, I am an alcoholic.The magic eight ball says, decidedly so.So I didn\u2019t go to AA. I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged. I didn\u2019t feel \u201calcoholic enough\u201d and I definitely bought into the stereotype of who I thought would be there. I believed that I couldn\u2019t just show up with my skinny jeans, fresh highlights, and my anxiety amongst people with \u201creal problems.\u201d What would they think of me?I was in denial. I had real problems and drinking was definitely one of them. AA could have given me the support that I needed. I was wrong about the people there and I already know (from years as a therapist) that there is nothing is more powerful at making and sustaining change than accountability, ongoing support, and encouragement from those who have gone before you.We are a society that is great at treating your problems but not so great at helping you before your problems become problems. In other words, if you have an obvious mental breakdown or get close to an overdose you can easily find people who are telling their story or offering up suggestions for help. But if you are somewhere between someone who is \u201cdoing great\u201d and someone who \u201cdrinks a little too much and has a lot of anxiety afterward\u201d good luck. Wellness services are just harder to come by, more difficult to find, and complicated to pay for.But here\u2019s the thing-we make things complicated. We get hyper focused on a diagnosis, label, a name. Then we filter through our memories to find descriptions that fit those labels. And when they don\u2019t match or add up we feel stuck. Those images, memories, and stereotypes aren\u2019t always true. They are the blockbuster version of problems and they hold us back. We have to let go of what we think an alcoholic looks like, or what depression looks like, or what anxiety looks like so we can stop hiding behind the label.I finally decided to give up on the stereotype and learn more. I held my own \u201cmeetings\u201d in my room with my books and with my online people that I didn\u2019t have to talk to or interact with. I read and read and read and I learned about the effects of alcohol. I learned that alcohol is a poisonous chemical that is meant to be addictive.And, finally, I learned the most important thing of all. Drinking somehow became the main focus on my life. I woke up with a mild hangover and by noon I was looking forward to \u201chappy hour.\u201d And with all of that going on there just wasn\u2019t much time for anything else. No time for reading, growing, writing, dreaming, meeting goals, no time for anything. It\u2019s impossible to fully experience life if you\u2019re just buying time until the next time you can escape.\u201cYou Can\u2019t Selectively Numb Emotions. When you Numb the Dark You Numb the Light.\u201d-Bre\u0144e BrownIf you\u2019re searching for the \u201ccriteria\u201d or the answer to what\u2019s \u201cwrong with you\u201d and you\u2019re not finding it just don\u2019t give up. Ditch the ideas that you have around how you should be responding to your life and instead focus on how you are actually responding to your life. Then open your mind and show up wherever you think you don\u2019t belong. You might be surprised at who will open the door to help you.And when you\u2019re feeling better don\u2019t forget to turn around and tell your story. We need to hear the stories of people who ended up in darkness without some big plot or twist to the story. We need those stories of people who had it pretty good but ended up depressed or anxious or addicted or struggling anyway. Your story matters and someone out there needs to hear it.Originally published at https:\/\/www.spaliveaf.com on August 20, 2019.Written byWritten by","14915":"Saggy boobs are the benchmarks for rest spots.

Trappings of foiled plots to exercise injustice become disposable scraps that slide off with the ease that defies gravity of youth.Gray strands shuffle out of place with vengeance of when darker, shiner particles easily parted to balance smooth profile in the sun with jealous stares. Ridges peek up like a game of chase, that runs into detours of body marks that pummel buttocks and sides of fleshy handles. Once muscled bundles split into deposits that move around in search of final resting place.Mirrors laugh back at sullen stares in the bright morning light, that never bows to the hovering clouds of halo that follows everywhere. There are breaks of gratitude when cracks smoothen with slabs of odorless products, disappearing with wipes. Dye jobs to rob away the hue of cemented graves no longer work hard enough. High-priced machines feel the results of labor while body and spirit aimlessly trudge through air to recover what has gone missing.When you look deeper, the eyes have it.The entryway to beyond the wilting frame of used up decades is carried in the vision of remembrance and the transfer of emotions to somewhere.The eyes have it.Written byWritten by","15143":"Do you feel bloated and nauseous some of the time, or even worse, all of the time? If you have a \u201cfood baby\u201d after your meals along with abdominal pain and fatigue, then you want to read this. You might have SIBO.What is SIBO?Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is a serious condition that occurs when there is an abnormally high amount of bacteria in the small intestine. SIBO is generally not caused by a single type of bacteria but rather an overgrowth of the various types of bacteria that should normally be found much lower down, in the colon. We have good bacteria in our small intestine (the upper gut), but too much of it can throw our microbiome out of balance.The small intestine is the longest section of the digestive tract. This is where food intermingles with digestive juices, and nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. When bacteria belonging in another part of the gut starts to grow there, it causes a bloated belly, acid reflux, cramping, gas, and diarrhea or constipation.It can also lead to poor digestion, causing nutritional deficiencies due to insufficient absorption of essential vitamins and minerals. In particular, the bacteria will take up certain B vitamins, such as B12, before our own cells have a chance to absorb these important nutrients. They may also consume some of the amino acids that make up the proteins we\u2019ve ingested, which can lead to both mild protein deficiency and an increase in ammonia production. To make matters even worse, the bacteria can also decrease fat absorption through their effect on bile acids, leading to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins such as A and D. Chronic deficiencies of essential nutrients can hinder vital processes, such as neurotransmitter synthesis, cell wall repair, liver detoxification, and production of glutathione, the body\u2019s master antioxidant. Consequences include fatigue, weakness, and even damage to the central nervous system.SIBO harms the intestinal mucosa \u2014 the innermost layer of cells lining the digestive tract. This damage can lead to a condition called \u201cleaky gut,\u201d where the intestinal barrier becomes permeable and allows large protein molecules to escape into the bloodstream. This is known to have a number of potential complications, including immune reactions that cause food allergies, generalized inflammation, sensitivities, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and autoimmune diseases.Symptoms of SIBOBloating after eating carbohydrates or a high-fiber meal is the number one symptom of SIBO. This happens because bacteria metabolize the carbs and fiber and produce gases, one of which is called methane. Why is methane harmful? Because it shuts off the synthesis of a chemical called serotonin. In a healthy body, the vast majority of serotonin is produced in the gut. However, with an inflammatory condition like SIBO, the gut instead makes other chemicals, called kynurenic and quinolinic acid. These cause bloating, nausea, constipation, depression, and brain fog and can interfere with sleep. Some people also develop acid reflux, excessive flatulence, fatigue, body\/joint pain, food intolerances (e.g., to gluten), and chronic illnesses such as fibromyalgia.Causes of SIBOSIBO is caused by or associated with a wide array of conditions. These include but aren\u2019t limited to: a weakened immune system, abdominal surgery, celiac disease, chronic pancreatitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, diverticulosis, endometriosis, IBS, intestinal lymphoma, low gut motility, low thyroid function (hypothyroid or Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis), scleroderma, and ulcerative colitis.Another underlying cause of SIBO symptoms is blind loop syndrome. This occurs when the small intestine actually forms a small loop, causing food to bypass parts of the digestive tract. It also slows down the passage of food and waste products, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. Aging is a further risk factor for developing small intestine bacterial overgrowth, because as we age, we produce lower levels of stomach acid which can cause poor motility.Various medications are also associated with an increased risk for developing SIBO, such as narcotic pain medications, steroids, and immunosuppressant drugs. Proton pump inhibitors, taken for conditions such as acid reflux, heartburn, GERD, LPR, ulcers, gastritis and Helicobacter pylori, are also problematic, as they inhibit gastric acid secretions. Gastric acid in the stomach kills many bacteria before they can pass through to the rest of the gut. Low stomach acid levels can raise gastric pH, leading to bacterial overgrowth.Damage to the small intestine caused by inflammation \u2014 for example, from food sensitivities, medications, toxins, and chronic stress \u2014 can reduce the production of digestive enzymes. The overgrowth of bacteria that leads to SIBO can also cause digestive enzyme deficiency, resulting in a never-ending cycle of poor digestive function.Low thyroid function (hypothyroidism) can affect all cells of the body, including the cells of the GI tract, by reducing activity within the GI tract, slowing the migrating motor complex that triggers peristalsis, which leads to low motility that can encourage bacterial overgrowth. Oxidative damage caused by high blood sugar in diabetes can also damage the nerves that regulate and control intestinal motility.Abdominal adhesions, otherwise known as scar tissue, arise from chronic inflammation (as in IBS or Crohn\u2019s disease), infection, or surgery. Scarring can create an obstruction or distortion of the intestines, and again can damage the nerves in the GI tract.Chronic stress is a risk factor for SIBO. When the body enters the fight-or-flight state, gastric function is altered. Notably, stress appears to be a contributing factor in virtually all SIBO cases.Symptoms of depressed immunity have been associated with increased risk for bacterial overgrowth. Immunoglobulins secreted in a healthy individual prevent bacterial proliferation. When the immune system is depressed, it produces fewer immunoglobulins, creating favorable conditions for SIBO.Excess estrogens can inhibit the excretion of bile salts from the liver into the intestines. Bile salts have antimicrobial activity, so a deficiency in them can increase the risk of SIBO. Estrogen also delays gastric emptying and motility, making SIBO more likely.The body has several different ways of preventing SIBO. These include gastric acid secretion to maintain an acidic environment, waves of bowel wall muscular activity, immunoglobulins in the intestinal fluid, and a valve that normally allows the flow of contents into the large bowel but prevents them from refluxing back into the small bowel.The causes of SIBO are usually complex and are likely to affect more than one of these protective mechanisms. Predisposing factors are likely to be present before the onset of SIBO and set the stage for the condition to take hold. So by simply treating the bacterial overgrowth directly, we might not address factors that will encourage SIBO to return at the first opportunity. In other words, the underlying cause(s) of SIBO must be resolved, or there is a high chance of recurrence.SIBO has primarily been observed in people with chronic gut issues, and with neurological disorders or diabetes, which can lead to dysfunction in the nerves that line the gut. However, it is now also being seen in seemingly healthy people. It\u2019s not clear whether this is due to better diagnostic testing or other reasons, such as high-carb diets. We do know that diet can disrupt the healthy balance of gut bacteria. The main culprits here are sugars, carbohydrates, and alcohol. We\u2019ll talk more about these a bit later.DiagnosisTo diagnose SIBO, a functional medicine doctor will use a lactulose breath test, which measures the methane and hydrogen gases released by bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine. This can determine whether you have those bacteria growing in the wrong place.To prepare for the test, you will strictly avoid carbohydrates (breads, pasta, rice, cakes, etc.) for 1\u20132 days and fast overnight before the test. At the doctor\u2019s office, you will ingest a lactulose or glucose solution which acts as a substrate for bacterial fermentation. You\u2019ll then breathe into a small balloon, and the doctor will measure the levels of hydrogen and methane in your breath over a period of time with successive sample collections. These measurements are then analyzed by the lab against a baseline test to determine the likelihood of SIBO.Treatment OptionsSIBO is a chronic condition that can be successfully treated, but doing so takes patience, perseverance, and a change in diet. The best long-term results involve treating the root cause(s) of SIBO. Let\u2019s take a look at the various options.Eradicate the bacterial overgrowth. A functional medicine doctor may prescribe antibiotics and\/or herbal antimicrobials, along with other supplements such as fiber or probiotics. Multiple rounds of treatment may be necessary.Rifaximin (brand name Xifaxan) is the most studied antibiotic for SIBO and may be the preferred option because it stays local to the small intestine and doesn\u2019t disrupt the good bacteria in the colon. However, it does kill the healthy bacteria in the small intestine. Xifaxan maybe be used for hydrogen-dominant SIBO. An antibiotic called neomycin (brand name Neo-rx) may be used for methane-dominant SIBO.Your doctor may prescribe an elemental diet. This is a physician-monitored liquid diet that has been shown to normalize breath tests. This may be an appropriate approach for those allergic to antibiotics or for those who don\u2019t respond to antibiotic treatment. Work with your doctor before starting this diet, and follow their instructions.Note that nutritional support is required for those with nutrient deficiencies, malnutrition and weight loss, so your doctor may advise you to take supplements. It\u2019s important to follow the doctor\u2019s directions.Restore good bacteria. Restoring good bacteria is essential for achieving normal digestion and nutrient absorption, and boosting your immune system. This must be done carefully, as not all probiotics are appropriate for people recovering from SIBO. In fact, certain probiotics, the ones that contain lactobacillus and\/or bifidobacterium strains, can exacerbate your symptoms because they will support the bacteria that aren\u2019t supposed to be in your small intestine. Soil-based probiotics will not exacerbate your symptoms and will still provide all the benefits of a probiotic.There are a few SIBO diets that may help. It\u2019s important to note that these are not long-term diets. They are tools used to help manage symptoms, identify food sensitivities\/intolerances, and help the digestive system heal. Once your symptoms have improved, you can carefully and systematically reintroduce previously restricted foods.The low FODMAP diet. FODMAP is an acronym standing for \u201cFermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols.\u201d This is the least restrictive diet in that it allows certain vegetables, fruits, nuts, grains, legumes, low-lactose and dairy. It is advisable to follow a low FODMAP elimination diet for 30 days.The GAPS diet. GAPS stands for \u201cGut And Psychology Syndrome.\u201d This diet was developed by Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride for clients suffering from neurological and GI disorders. The GAPS diet restricts all commercial dairy products, as well as grains, starchy vegetables, processed foods, and refined carbohydrates. There is a strict introductory phase, followed by the full GAPS diet, then a food reintroduction phase. This diet helps to repair leaky gut syndrome by providing supportive nutrients and re-inoculating the gut with healthy probiotic-enriched foods.The Paleo diet. This well-known diet restricts grains, legumes, dairy, sugar, processed foods, and alcohol.The SIBO protocol: The 5R ProgramThe 5R Program will help you eradicate SIBO, restore a balanced microbiome, and maintain that balance to prevent future bacterial overgrowth.The 1st R: RemoveRemove stressors that irritate the intestinal tract and trigger an immune response, causing inflammation and increasing the levels of pro-inflammatory and pathogenic bacteria. Eliminate:\u2022 alcohol\u2022 artificial sweeteners\u2022 gluten\u2022 lectins\u2022 non-organic dairy products\u2022 refined and hydrogenated oils (e.g., canola)\u2022 refined grains\u2022 processed or genetically modified foods\u2022 sugar\u2022 yeast\u2022 initially for the first four weeks steer clear of fermented foods, which feed good bacteria and yeast.The 2nd R: ReplaceReplace your digestive secretions. This means adding back essentials such as digestive enzymes, hydrochloric acid, and bile acids. These are required for proper digestion but can be compromised by medications, diet, diseases, aging, and other factors.Eating anti-inflammatory foods such as leafy greens, turmeric, and ginger will also help reintroduce healthy and diverse bacteria into your gut, replacing pathogenic bacteria. These foods contain polyphenols, which have anti-inflammatory, anti-aging, and antioxidant properties and provide neurological and cardiovascular protection. Polyphenols reduce the risk of disease in the intestine and increase the abundance and diversity of gut bacteria, helping prevent and treat gastrointestinal (GI) disorders.The 3rd R: ReinoculateProbiotics in the form of foods and supplements are often needed to help reestablish a balanced gut flora. This is called reinoculation. As mentioned earlier, use soil-based probiotics, and aim to ingest 100 billion CFU (colony forming units) a day. Recommended probiotic strains include:- Bacillus clausii- Bacillus coagulans- Bacillus subtilis- Saccharomyces boulardiiYou can also help beneficial bacteria flourish by consuming foods high in prebiotics, which are the foods that beneficial gut bacteria eat. These are found in foods with soluble fiber, such as artichokes, beets, carrots, garlic, jicama, leeks, onions, radishes, and fermented foods.The 4th R: RepairOne consequence of SIBO is malnutrition, so it\u2019s important to recover key nutrients so your GI tract has the ability to repair itself. These nutrients include zinc and the antioxidant vitamins A, C, D3, E, and K3. Using food and supplements to boost your intake of these nutrients is essential for recovering from SIBO.The most beneficial substances are probiotics (described above), aloe vera, collagen, digestive enzymes, glutathione, iron, l-glutamine, licorice root, marshmallow root, omega-3 fish oils, and zinc. Consuming bone broth is also a great way to starve out undesirable bacteria, while providing nutrients such as proline and glycine to heal the gut membrane.The 5th R: RebalanceLifestyle choices play crucial roles in maintaining a healthy gut. Diet, alcohol, drugs, environmental factors, stress, sleep, and exercise all affect the health of the GI tract. When you have SIBO, rebalancing all of these factors is important for healing. In addition to the dietary guidelines provided earlier in this article, implement the following to get yourself back in balance:Sun Exposure: Regular sun exposure enhances the healing process through the assimilation of biophotons and also provides vitamin D3 nutrients, which is essential to optimize in order to heal effectively.Reduce stress: Chronic stress has been shown to harm beneficial gut bacteria. Negative changes in gut bacteria affect the brain, resulting in anxiety and depression. So it\u2019s important to engage in activities that put our minds at ease. Practicing meditation or yoga is one way to reduce stress and calm the fight-or-flight response, which prompts the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that disturb your microbiome.Sleep more: Lack of sleep can cause poor distribution of healthy gut bacteria. Sleep deprivation also increases the production of inflammatory substances secreted by the immune system. Getting enough sleep decreases and prevents inflammation, halting the development of various GI disorders and other diseases, including SIBO, as well as colorectal cancer, gastroesophageal reflux, IBS, leaky gut, and liver disorders.Exercise regularly: Physical activity enhances immune function and lowers cortisol levels, reducing stress, anxiety, and depression. Exercise can also reduce inflammation in the body, increase the production of short-chain fatty acids, which are essential for healing a damaged GI tract, maintaining a healthy microbiome, and achieving overall well-being.This article is for informational and educational purposes only.

That on its own wasn\u2019t news; we\u2019re all hosts to a wide and rich variety of parasites.What makes this one special is that scientists discovered that, when this tiny little parasite was present in rats, those rats became far less afraid of the smell of cat urine than normal.Weird, right?It turned out T. gondii was manipulating them. It changed their behavior, to make it more likely for them to be eaten by cats, which is the next species of host for T. gondii, and the only host in which the parasite can naturally reproduce.Mind alteration in animals infected by parasites is a relatively new field of study. That being said, it\u2019s been demonstrated to be a relatively common adaptation: parasites with more than one host need a way to go between the hosts. And what easier way than to just take control of your host by changing their behavior mentally?The concern began when people realized that a parasite that could alter rodent behavior? Maybe it could change human behavior, too.A rash of studies came out showing that people infected with the parasite (up to 84% of the human population in some countries) experienced significant changes in behavior. Infection with T. gondii was linked to everything from entrepreneurship to the sex ratio to bad driving. Not only that, but there were differences in how men and women were perceived to show the effects. To sum it up in one especially demonstrative 2006 headline, \u201cParasite makes men dumb, women sexy.\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t just that. According to some studies, men were more likely to be impulsive and jealous when infected. Women were more likely to be more warm-hearted, moralistic, concerned with their image.In terms of popular science, these studies were like gold. A parasite caused by cat ownership that changed men and women in different ways by controlling their brain? A scientific study that backed up the Crazy Cat Lady stereotype? People ate it up. Not only that, but some men, in particular, started looking for ways to infect the women in their lives, intentionally, to reap these alleged positive characteristics.One recent study published, the most comprehensive to date, found absolutely no correlation between toxoplasmosis in humans and weird behavior.They note:It has been observed that the \u2018hotter\u2019 the topic and as more studies are reported and accumulate, replication becomes more difficult [49]. If we accept that the findings reported in the present article represent scenario two, then views of the link between T. gondii and aberrant behavior may need to be tempered accordingly.What this means is that people got way too excited about the possibilities of turning their girlfriends into sexually adventurous, warm-hearted T. gondii hosts and bought into the myth.The only definitive link between toxoplasmosis and humans is the fact that if you become infected with this parasite when you\u2019re pregnant, you\u2019re at a much higher risk of a complicated pregnancy. There\u2019s been some research on incidence of this parasite in causing schizophrenia, but that too is inconclusive as of yet.It can also cause blindness and death in immuno-compromised sections of the population, meaning people who are already unhealthy. Of course, that\u2019s not as fun a headline as \u201cParasite makes men dumb, women sexy,\u201d so that sort of scientific finding is not as highly popularized.What a lot of the population doesn\u2019t normally realize is that if something is true in mice, or flies, or any other lab organism, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be true in humans. The biological mechanisms governing our systems are vastly different in complicated ways. Sometimes they\u2019re similar, but far more often, more testing and experimentation needs to be done before we know if the same thing will happen to humans as happens to any lab organism.The problem is that doesn\u2019t translate neatly to exciting, click-baity headlines.It is very true that rats, when exposed to this parasite, significantly alter their behavior in a way that makes them more likely to get eaten by cats. But that makes sense \u2014 the parasite wants to get back into its primary host, the cat, which is the only place it can reproduce, making more of itself to pass on to more rats and cats in an endless cycle.Humans, however, are rarely eaten by cats, so we\u2019re kind of a dead-end for the parasite. The same mechanisms the parasite would have evolved to make them good at manipulating rats won\u2019t be very effective in humans, because the parasite has no need for that kind of manipulation.Frankly, people wanted to buy into the crazy cat lady hype. They wanted to believe that a parasite infecting an estimated 30\u201350% of the global human population was able to make people more likely to become entrepreneurs.People are successful in their relationships and in their businesses for a variety of complex reasons. It\u2019s in our nature to want to boil down these sorts of things to a single factor, which is what makes this myth so attractive to us. But, for now, it\u2019s just that \u2014 a myth.As a cat-owner with two degrees in biology, there were large parts of me that wanted this to be true, too \u2014 it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s fun! But the science never lies.It\u2019s possible I\u2019m wrong and there is a direct link between infection and behavioral changes in humans. But I\u2019m inclined to believe, like K. Sugden, that people want it to be true too much for the current studies to be believable. More studies, with better science, controlling for additional factors, need to be done to show behavioral changes. Until then? I\u2019ll be hanging out with my cats.Written byWritten by","15161":"dClinic is a Singaporean based organisation created by experts in Clinical, Wellness and Blockchain, who have come together from across the globe to bring a new wave of Vitality and care to consumers and care professionals.Our team individually and together have many years of experience in Blockchain, healthcare and wellness, and seeing the crisis of healthcare around the world, know that unless something is done differently, the huge spend will continue, patient outcomes will be secondary and the overall result will be much of the same.As the name suggests, we are a clinic of sorts.

Her recent book, ADDICTION BY DESIGN: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas (Princeton University Press 2012), draws on extended research among compulsive gamblers and the designers of the slot machines they play to explore the relationship between technology design and the experience of addiction. Her next book, KEEPING TRACK, concerns the rise of digital self-tracking technologies and the new modes of introspection and self-governance they engender\u201d.This anthropologist has taken an interest in Quantified Self (Fitbit, Apple Watch etc\u2026) and especially in technologies that not only produce new information about oneself, but also promise to help users to change their addictive or compulsive behaviours.I logically looked at his study, taking a certain distance, to find out how far new technologies could go in terms of addictive, compulsive or anxious behaviour. Of course, we must not take our eyes off the fact that as I write, applied research is constantly evolving very rapidly to meet our needs\u2026.for consumption.These behavioral technologies are multiplying, like:However, it is obvious that people do not want more data, they only want objects that help them, that transform them.The challenge is no longer so much self-knowledge, as in the early days of Quantified Self, but rather a technology that takes care of you.By expanding its market, is \u201cself-measurement\u201d on the way to becoming \u201cself-infantilization\u201d?In fact, devices that collect data on our behaviours are not enough to encourage their users to change their habits.We need \u201cguru objects\u201d and not just objects that measure everything about us. New objects are helping us every day to take care of ourselves, to allow us to get to know ourselves better and to follow our health more closely.If health, well-being and beauty are linked, we must find solutions to compensate for the bad waves coming from our environment. Objects allow us to track, inform and combat these various types of pollution (noise, sun, light, air, etc.) :To get to know each other from the inside, we also return to an ultra-connected world that is not always reliable, but it seems useful for some people at first sight or reassuring\u2026But \u201cA technology that is static, that is passive, does not persist and does not engage you\u201d says Professor Nick van Terheyden, Leader in Digital Healthcare and Innovation and former Chief Medical Officer for Dell. This specialist calls back most users abandon their connected objects after a few weeks of use.Natascha Sch\u00fcll\u2019s interest in self-measurement technologies seems to be a reaction to her research on addiction design, as a way to regain power over oneself, in relation to those companies that design objects to manipulate people.Natascha Sch\u00fcll uses a Lumo, a device that aims to correct your postures by vibrating when you stand badly (others are being prepared, such as BetterBack).This would seem to relieve her of the burden of remembering to stand up straight all day. It would be a way to empower technology to tell you who you are to help you live the way you want to live.On this point and coming back from afar, having tried all the means at my disposal to relieve violent chronic pain, a simple \u201cBackalast posture garment\u201d used a few hours a day for a few months, you simply learn again how to behave at a desk, during a sports session or sitting with your laptop on your couch.Without using the latest state-of-the-art technology, which is only a crutch (or even a gadget) and not a solution to your back pain, you will simply have learned to adopt the right posture habits at a lower cost. Of course, each case is to be put into perspective, each one is different.But for this anthropologist, not all self-measurement devices are the same. For example, Muse, a band that monitors brain waves to help people understand their state of mind by playing different sounds depending on whether they are distracted or calm.She describes the moments she spends with Muse as moments of connected meditation assisted by technology, which helps to regain or keep her calm.However, this crossover between self-measurement and behavioural technologies poses new challenges.First of all, it should be noted that these attractive devices in the \u201cWellness\u201d category have never been medically validated. Then as a British Medical Journal article worried: this self-monitoring also generates anxiety in those who use them \u2014 unless that anxiety is a consequence of that use.Behind this criticism of wellness applications, we always notice the same observation: they are ultimately of little use to people!A study on applications for keeping a diary of caloric intake in your diet showed that only 3% of those who download an application of this type use it for more than a week.The researchers who conducted this study show that the social nature of these applications, rather than encouraging people to their nutritional efforts, tends to discourage them when progress is not forthcoming, which is the case for most users.Many of them have difficulty determining precisely their caloric intake via these applications: the quantities we ingest are not precise, the list of ingredients in what we cook too\u2026This means that many people have to underestimate or overestimate their caloric intake, which also encourages abandonment.This is the case for many other applications, such as those that encourage people to record the number of cigarettes they smoke to help them quit.Worse still, since it is easier to obtain nutritional information from industrial foods, it can even encourage the use of less healthy food. Another problem is the difficulty in informing its application when you are in society.These are all stress-generating problems that ultimately hinder the achievement of goals and motivation.He believes that when you start doing marketing studies and pre-sales strategies before you even design a \u201cWellness\u201d or other product, you shouldn\u2019t expect a miracle product that after a few uses erases your concerns. Starting with scientific research, obtaining tangible results and finding variable applications on the market seems far more logical to me!For my part, I grieved my physical and sporting capacities of the past and for the rest I discovered after 8 long years how I could live with them and for a while limit them by a very demanding, benevolent and adapted sporting discipline. And it is on this path of life that I became acquainted with mindfulness meditation, which intuitively after years of daily practice, and not after a few sessions, has made me so much stronger and more open mentally but also physically. I don\u2019t like to reveal myself by nature but for a good cause: beware of dream sellers!!Everything has a price to pay: courage sometimes, endurance, persistence and a little hope of getting through it\u2026This is exactly what the researcher Candice Lanius tells us, in a more personal style, in an article on the hidden anxieties of self-measurement .For her, the use of self-monitoring technologies creates anxiety about data capture. Tracing and self-documentation technologies create discouraging experiences, especially when the user is confronted with things that are difficult to quantify.This researcher has downloaded several self-measurement applications.She used Soleus, an application to measure her movements, MyFitnessPal to measure her diet and calories, MyMinutes , an application to measure the time spent on her various projects\u2026But once the enthusiasm for novelty had passed, she realized how much self-care had an impact on her life.First, it takes time to inform these different applications. She would spend up to 20 minutes a day informing MyMinutes. On her food application, she spent a lot of time entering the nutritional information of the foods she was buying (even though the application has thousands of foods already filled in). For foodstuffs that are not clearly proportioned, this Professor bought a scale and measured the ingredients before cooking them!In short, the time spent recording your data quickly became time consuming and boring. As soon as she entered \u201cpoor\u201d, incomplete or missed data, she became worried.To make a long story short:Her GPS watch had trouble maintaining its signal, so she avoided running through the woods. She stopped eating the brownies prepared by her friends. As for the activity tracker, it quickly stopped, because filling it interfered with its pause times. Her feeling was clear:\u201c My anxiety was the result of not being able to reliably capture my data while feeling compelled to do so. Without reliable and complete measurements, how could I become the ideal version of myself? \u201d \u2014 Dr. Candice LaniusTo fight against this anxiety, the response of the suppliers of these Wellness technologies most often consists in developing more suitable or even more numerous sensors to quantify the data as accurately as possible.If tomorrow objects succeed in developing ever finer and more precise measurements, they will not succeed in removing the anguish that self-measurement and self-control seek to fill: that is, to become this unattainable ideal model of oneself!Being a sportswoman myself, I wondered about the accuracy of the sensors inserted in these devices supposed to be as close as possible to our physiological data (heart rate, average speed with or without difference in altitude during a run), state of calm found and advanced during guided meditative practices, muscle mass rate on a connected balance etc\u2026.Despite all the very successful marketing of these new technologies, even renowned brands have failed as in this study by giving irrelevant data.I wanted to underline once again this mass consumption that pushes us to buy again and again without thinking or taking time to have a critical look at these \u201cWellness\u201d technologies that does not bring us anything good (I am obviously not talking about those who are beyond our reach and dedicated to professional athletes) except rapid fatigue and sometimes a feeling of anxiety (especially in weight loss procedures).So be careful, find out about old and new methods that have proven their worth without especially resorting to a trend that does not only want you good!Thank you for the time you have devoted to reading this article, hoping that it will have brought you a little something. Feel free to leave me your constructive comments or feedback, which makes the subject even more lively thanks to you, Dear reader.I also thank you for the evaluation (claps) you have given to this article, which allows me to look even further into my writing endeavours ;-)Written byWritten by","15224":"Here\u2019s the thing nobody tells you when your loved ones are struggling: you\u2019re going to struggle, too. You\u2019re going to make wrong steps and bad choices, all in pursuit of helping the people you love. It won\u2019t leave you unscarred, unscathed. You\u2019ll bear the physical and mental marks for a long time.Humans are creatures of connection, of intimacy. What happens to one person in your network will reverberate across with surprising ramifications. Your emotions will move in directions you don\u2019t expect. Your heart will be tried in ways you couldn\u2019t have anticipated. And you will do everything wrong.When she came to me, crying, blood on her arms, so unhappy with herself and the world that she wanted to leave, I did not draw up boundaries. I threw myself wholeheartedly into trying to save her.I spent nights with her, went to the doctor with her, cried with her and struggled with her. I researched movies it would be safe for us to watch. I dropped other plans, other friends, in order to help her.When she stopped eating, stopped feeling that she deserved the nutrients that would sustain her, I felt echoes of it in my soul, too. I was violently reminded of when I hated myself enough to hate food, and I would be lying if I said it didn\u2019t affect me. There were days I pushed food away and went on long, empty runs, dragged down again into that dark place I\u2019d escaped from once. But I ignored the warning bells and dived in deeper.It is remarkably easy to preach self-love and self-care while forgetting to do it yourself. It\u2019s easy because it feels selfish to care for yourself when you\u2019re trying to care for others, too. It feels morally wrong to put yourself first when people who need you have a greater claim on your time. You\u2019ll find it simple to forget those airline warnings and fix others\u2019 air masks before you fix your own.I railed at my parents who told me to get out, that they just didn\u2019t understand, that I couldn\u2019t abandon her. I loved here and I had to save her. I had to save her, and to take a step away would be to give up on her and I just wouldn\u2019t do it. When she jumped into the freezing river one night because nobody picked up the phone at three in the morning, and finally dragged her cold, dripping wet self to a friend\u2019s house, still shivering hours later when I finally saw her, I felt horribly guilty that I\u2019d been freely sleeping while she\u2019d been suffering. I did not deserve to sleep when she felt she didn\u2019t deserve to live.I did not sleep enough, did not eat enough and did not talk enough. And it was too easy to do because I was trying desperately to help someone who had it worse.The first time I started crying unexpectedly and without warning at something trivial, tremors shaking my body, someone asked me if I was OK. I\u2019d dropped an ice cream cone, after all, not been mortally wounded.I did not reveal I\u2019d been supporting someone suicidal. I laughed through my tears instead and said it must be because my period was coming. It didn\u2019t even occur to me that I was affected deeply, because I was so out of the habit of putting my own needs first, of considering my own mental state.When, in my peer support group, we discussed supporting suicidal friends, I had to leave the room because my emotions were welling up in me so fiercely. I remember staring at the floor, trying to keep it all in. I needed to be strong.Our group leader came out after a few minutes and sat on the ground with me. She asked me what was wrong. And as she asked, I couldn\u2019t do anything but cry.She asked me how she could help, and once again I felt guilty that I was getting help offered, that I was the one with resources and a support network when one of my friends wanted to kill herself. I did not feel I deserved it.When she told me she didn\u2019t want a doctor, didn\u2019t want to go to a clinic, didn\u2019t want to be prescribed medication, I nodded and said I understood. I was her hero, I was the only one who could save her, and if she didn\u2019t want anyone else, I wouldn\u2019t push her there.How could a nameless stranger help her? How could someone do a better job than me, who knew her inside and out, who was familiar with her struggles? No matter how well trained or professional a doctor would be, how could they drop everything and put her first, as I had done?I felt like the only thing in the world standing between her life and her death. And I couldn\u2019t let go.Isolated, exhausted, struggling with my own revived demons, I collapsed mentally and physically. Out of sheer necessity for my own survival, I was pushed aside by other friends who were able to see what I couldn\u2019t, who were able to go where I wouldn\u2019t.She was referred to specialists. She lived. I lived. Despite doing everything wrong, despite going right down with her, everyone survived, and for that, I feel lucky.Nobody tells you that suicidal people are like sinking ships, that if you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll go down too. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re doing everything right, that you need to sacrifice yourself to save their lives, that you\u2019re the only one who can make a difference, and you\u2019ll be wrong.I needed to learn to let go, to do what I safely could and then step away.Written byWritten by","15312":"I didn\u2019t realize the can of worms I\u2019d be opening when, after getting back from a doctor\u2019s appointment, I posted on Twitter that I\u2019d lost 77 pounds in the last two months.You would think I\u2019d set off some kind of bomb. Usually, my Twitter is the kind of quiet, polite conversation that belongs to the terminally un-viral personalities like me. I\u2019m not witty, I\u2019m not popular, but, for a couple of hours after that, my notification were going off like I was some kind of grade-A Influencer.Apparently, 77 pounds is a lot of weight.And on one hand, I know that it is. I may have even had some pride about it. I mean, it\u2019s not like all of this weight loss was an accident, but I hadn\u2019t realized just how big and flashy that number was.I mean, I\u2019ve spent most of my life in and out of Weight Watchers meetings surrounded by people who were just 10 or 20 pounds away from their goal weight.Even if they\u2019re not, even if they are, say 50 pounds away from their goal weight, losing 77 pounds in two months is still an absurd amount. That\u2019s Biggest Loser type of numbers.But for me, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket.When I had my first weigh-in appointment with my bariatric surgeon, I weighed around 560 pounds. Two months later, I\u2019m down to 480ish.And there is a part of me that wants to be over the fucking moon, if only because I\u2019m finally below 500 pounds, for the first time in nearly half a decade.But on a more practical level, it\u2019s not like anything\u2019s really changed. Sure, I can walk a few more steps without being short of breath. And that\u2019s wonderful. I guess.But I still get short of breath really quickly. I still can\u2019t comfortably fit into most cars. There\u2019s still no chance of me ever being able to board a commercial airplane. I have to walk sideways down a bus aisle. I still draw looks and harassment. I can\u2019t even go to the gym without getting shit from the skinny hipsters.I lost a lot of weight, yes.But there is so much more to lose. Another 250 pounds, and I might feel like I\u2019m able to breathe again.I am a strong believer in Murphy\u2019s Law. If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.At both of my last weigh ins, I was deathly afraid. What was I going to do if the scale had gone up? Would I have died of embarrassment, that my fat ass had become even fatter?How would I explain it to the doctor, the nurse? Maybe I should have gone all Mockingjay and sewn a cyanide tab into the sleeve of my polo shirt. A little escape rope, if you will.If you walk into every situation expecting the worst, you will never be disappointed.And I know that, despite how the last two meetings have gone, I will go in dreading that I\u2019ve gained weight.I\u2019ve done a lot to change my habits. I\u2019m down to one meal a day. No carbs at all. Very little snacking.And, yet, I want to eat. All of the fucking time. I haven\u2019t developed that detachment from food that I imagine is the hallmark of being a healthy, skinny person.My mind is a continual stream of I want to fucking eat. I want to fucking eat. Carole is talking about cookies and cakes again. I want to fucking eat. I want to fucking eat. Why is Jon sharing a Facebook memory about Cheese Sticks? I want to fucking eat.Since cutting back on food, I\u2019ve felt kind of empty. Dejected. Almost detached from any sense of self.Food is comfort. Food is something to look forward to every day, when you might not have anything else to look forward to for a while. Food is peace.I guess my weight loss is evidence that I\u2019m doing good with controlling my eating.But the times that get stuck in my head are those where I\u2019m not doing good.Where I eat two bananas because I\u2019m just so fucking hungry in a way that a protein powder shake doesn\u2019t satisfy. When I open the cupboard or the fridge and just stare at all of the food.And, yes, the moments where I shouldn\u2019t eat that I actually do grab a snack. Some cottage cheese. Or cheese sticks. Or fruit.Because, if I was serious about this, I wouldn\u2019t eat.Only the one meal a day. And, if I was really serious, not even that. I\u2019d cut out everything. I\u2019d only drink water. I\u2019d stop messing up so much.I fail at that standard so much, that I can\u2019t honestly expect myself to have lost anything. And I\u2019m surprised when I have.I sure hope so.Written byWritten by","15352":"If we were asked what makes us conscious, emotions are undoubtedly on top of this list. Emotions are what drives an organism to action. They trigger automatic behaviors that have been adapted by evolution, aiding in survival. Without emotions, we wouldn\u2019t possess any will or rationale.In this digitally busy world, our fingers are scrolling more miles than our feet walk in a day. It seems that watching other people\u2019s lives is a regularly scheduled program. \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d is a go-to temporary relief for unhappiness. Passing time and finding distractions has never been easier. Pre-existing inner conflicts remain ignored. Meanwhile, we continue to allow our comparison-obsessed culture to erode our self-confidence and set unrealistic expectations.Our thinking is clouded, feelings are hurt, emotions are suppressed, direction is lost, thoughts are racing, and happiness is fleeting.Everyone\u2019s life goal should be maximizing their overall quality of self in order to give more and receive more. So, what is slowing us down? What is trapping people in this rollercoaster of mental struggles?For most of us, our brains are completely foreign to spending quality time with itself. We feed ourselves continuous external stimuli whether it be from music, television, phones, or laptops. This information-filled world keeps us so distracted. We don\u2019t prioritize slowing our racing thoughts to really listen, acknowledge, and resolve what\u2019s happening to us internally. In turn, our true nature \u2014 the one of peace, love, and kindness \u2014 becomes diluted by the illusions of the material world around us and the emotional world within us.We accumulate a lifetime of unresolved emotions that cause a cascade of self-destructive habitual tendencies such as self-doubt, shame, pride, fear, anxiety, anger, and more. The disposition for us to remain ignorant of the root cause enslaves us from living a fulfilling life.Circumstances don\u2019t confine us to mental deterioration, but our responses to these external stimuli do. Every person is capable of blossoming into a lotus from the mud. If the challenges of life don\u2019t occur, our insight lacks. When there is no mud, there is no lotus.We are often told to be happy, to think positive, to feel confident, to not overthink, and to let go of our troubles.However, society doesn\u2019t overtly teach us how to do any of these things.That is a high bar to meet without any help. These skills can not be learned by retweeting quotes. Like any acquired skill, practice is key. The practice of being present, the practice of observing ourselves without judgment, the practice of calming the brain, the practice of resolving our inner emotional conflicts, and the practice of increasing your self-awareness.The practice of meditation.Meditation increases a person\u2019s capacity to be aware of, control, express, and resolve his\/her emotions. Meditation teaches the skills needed to attain clarity and focus in thoughts and tranquility in emotions.Releasing Stored EmotionsWe have a database of information about all of our experiences embedded within us. It is who we are at the deepest level. Some memories are suppressed and some we continuously dissect and ruminate over. Our subconscious and conscious reactions to these experiences collectively shape our views and tendencies.Understanding this stream of reliable information and releasing the root emotions behind them is key to overcoming challenging emotions, limiting patterns, and achieving eternal happiness.Meditation is the process of peeling the layers of the emotional trauma, healing the negative energy blocks, and unveiling the true self. It is allocated time for introspection on inner conflicts, giving them a judgment-free platform to be addressed and healed with love energies. This results in the release of the inner conflict\u2019s strong grip on the host.A wandering mind is associated with being less happy, rumination, and worrying about the future and the past. Meditation teaches you how to quiet this monkey brain. A meditator\u2019s capacity to disengage from cognitive rumination is elevated through this practice of concentration, non-judgemental reflection, and increasing emotional awareness.Yale University conducted a study that concluded that meditation decreases activity in the default mode network (DMN), the part of the brain responsible for mind-wandering and self-referential thoughts. This implies that when the mind does start to wander, meditators are better at refocusing. They are also able to reduce the number of self-referential thoughts, in turn humbling the ego.Through this quicker recovery from a wandering mind, meditators build resilience to anxiety, depression, and stress, among many other mental challenges.A study at John Hopkins University found that meditation alleviates anxiety and depression to a similar degree as antidepressant drug therapy. Researcher Madhav Goyal and his team found that meditation had moderate evidence for improved anxiety, depression, and pain with an effect size of 0.3. Antidepressants also have an effect size of 0.3, which makes meditation a strong competitor with no negative side effects!Emotions are meant to be felt and released rather than stored and suppressed. Meditation teaches how to release emotional energy so that it may no longer weigh you down.Restructuring of the brainAs we lighten the soul of emotional baggage, inner self-talk becomes positive and constructive. Mood stabilizes and emotions become less heightened. The capacity of love increases and flows through all aspects of life.These changes in feelings, perceptions, and inner conflict resolution are not just subjective. They indeed correspond with structural changes in the brain, as detected by many studies. That\u2019s right, meditation literally restructures the brain!In a study conducted by researchers at Boston University and Massachusetts General Hospital, participant\u2019s brains were scanned using an fMRI brain before and after a series of meditation classes with astounding results. In just 8 weeks, there were far less \u201cdistress signal\u201d transmissions and the meditators \u201cfear center\u201d neural activity went silent. The amygdala \u4e00 part of the brain which plays a crucial role in fear responses, stress, and anxiety \u4e00 managed to physically shrink in size! The study also observed that low emotional reactivity from low amygdala responses persisted throughout the span of the meditator\u2019s life, even while the mediator was not actively meditating.This discovery has profound implications! Through the act of meditation, we can put the physical, mental, and emotional disabilities in the back seat and take charge of the highway towards holistic happiness.Cognitive ControlWhen a negative emotion arises in the consciousness, meditation teaches to simply observe, take note of its presence, and avoid self-identity with the emotion. For example, being aware that you are feeling an emotion of anger versus self-labeling with \u201cI am so angry right now\u201d.This change in thought process nurtures the realization that emotions are a temporary fleet. It aids the individual to disengage from negative emotions more quickly.Yale University study found that experienced meditators have stronger connections between specific brain regions that are implicated in self-monitoring and cognitive control. In other words, meditators can observe and control their emotions more effectively.Meditation increases one\u2019s non-judgemental awareness of a full range of emotions. The key step is to be mindful of but to never judge or react to your thoughts and feelings, and in this way creating a feeling of calmness.In fact, Harvard research has revealed that meditation increases cortical thickness in the hippocampus, part of the brain which regulates emotions and emotional responses. Follow-up research also found that meditation changes the brain regions associated with mood and arousal in a way that increases psychological well-being.The positive vibrations created during meditation compasses throughout the person\u2019s everyday life, spanning their focus and brain functioning.Call For ActionImagine the amount of suffering that can be avoided and the peace this movement can create if our society starts meditating.It all starts with you!Tesla once said, \u201cIf you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration\u201d. Meditation will shift your mind to see everything as energy. It will teach you how to understand, mold, and release energy.Guided meditations can help kick start your meditation journey. Reiki Raja Yoga meditation has empowered me with ancient yet scientific techniques practiced by yogis for thousands of years. It has allowed my little human brain to reach higher realms of awareness. I can better understand who I am, why I am, and what I am. The transformations that accompany this experience are too great not to be shared, thus, here I am.You can follow this link if you would like to try the Reiki Raja Yoga meditations that I began my journey with.With a definitive meditation path and practice, your ego will lessen, perception will widen, emotional awareness will increase, and reality will become immensely greater than just the self. Inner peace, lasting happiness, sharpened focus, positive relationships, and successful career will all be naturally cultivated in your life. Meditation is the missing puzzle piece to uplifting humanity as a whole one soul at a time.Your awakening is waiting for you.

Will the garden grow, will the rivers flow in the right direction, will the earth turn as it was taught, and if not how shall I correct it?\u201dMary Oliver wrote this one of her most famous poems.\u201cWas I right, was I wrong, will I be forgiven, can I do better? Is my eyesight fading or am I just imagining it, am I going to get rheumatism, lockjaw, dementia? Finally I saw that worrying had come to nothing. And gave it up. And took my old body and went out into the morning, and sang,\u201d she concluded.In a lot of ways, this mimics the addiction cycle.Something triggers you, you start the fear routine, and then you get the \u201chigh,\u201d or the reward, when you are able to find evidence to conclude that it was unfounded in the first place.This is not only unhealthy, it\u2019s also unhelpful.It means that most of your life is going to be spent sidetracked by a least likely outcome that\u2019s a product of sheer, irrational thinking \u2014 that is, unless you learn to correct it.In the same way that you should write down what you\u2019re grateful for each day to foster a sense of contentment, you should write down what you\u2019re worried about to foster a sense of rationality.Part of what makes worrying so addictive is the secretiveness of it all.You will probably feel very resistant toward the idea of writing down, specifically, what you\u2019re worried about, as though putting it on paper or a screen will make it more true. In other cases, it might be very humbling or humiliating. At last, you have to admit and fully come clean about the thing you are scared of. Doing this will not make it manifest faster, despite whatever your dark thoughts will tell you. Doing this will free you.Keep a log of everything you worry about throughout the day.In fact, try to trace back through the years of your life and write down everything you worried about that you can remember.It will not take very much time at all to discover that 99.999% of your fears were completely unfounded, wholly irrational, and not predictive of anything that was going to actually happen. They did nothing but distract you from your own life.If you do this daily, you\u2019ll change the way you perceive your worries. Like all of the ones that came before them, you\u2019ll realize they\u2019re nonsensical, and you\u2019ll laugh.You\u2019ll begin to see them for what they are, not what you believe they might be.People don\u2019t worry because they are gullible enough to think their illogical thoughts are true. They worry because it feels scary, and there\u2019s an instinctual part of the brain that associates worrying with feeling protected.In a sense, worrying can feel like preparing for the future. It can make you feel safe, seen, and taken care of.However, worrying is actually the worst way to protect yourself.#1 \u2014 Worrying distorts your reasoning skillsAnything you are scared of immediately becomes a thousand times more difficult to manage. So if there is something you are legitimately afraid could happen, worrying is weakening your ability to respond without panic, and actually make worse decisions.#2 \u2014 Worrying is an avoidance techniqueIt is less about the actual thing that scares you, and more about the control that comes with trying to navigate potential outcomes.#3 \u2014 Worrying becomes fear when it goes unaddressedWorrying that goes unchecked becomes fear. Worrying that is addressed becomes another weird thought that you can laugh off, because you know it\u2019s not true.#4 \u2014 Worrying is almost always irrationalThe thing you are consciously worried about is almost never the thing you are actually worried about. The reason why your worries are so often strange and \u201cleast likely\u201d scenarios is that you are projecting your need for comfort and control onto a situation that you know will most likely turn out fine in the end.#5 \u2014 Worrying is a habit you have to breakIf you worry constantly, you are putting yourself at a severe disadvantage when actual challenges present themselves in your life. It is very much like any other bad habit: it isn\u2019t just going to go away if you ignore it for long enough. Instead, you have to identify the impetus, and defy your urge to think back or ahead, and instead remain present with your actual discomfort, which is pushing your awareness to the past or future.Worrying is a life-long affliction that can be debilitating if it goes unchecked. Fortunately there are tools like these that can help us all be a little more free.Written byWritten by","15472":"HaikuEverything you doplants a seed that grows one way.Why not choose upward?Copyright \u00a9 2019 Bridget Webber.

A quick scroll through the website showed me that this professional\u2019s approach to mental health was to encourage people to manifest their destiny.For those of you who\u2019ve somehow managed to assiduously avoid all contact with self-improvement gurus, this means sending an intention out to the universe so it can take care of it for you.(Not to be confused with Manifest Destiny, a 19th century social theory that white settlers were destined to spread across the North American continent. Although perhaps not all that unrelated either\u2026)In fact, this life coach went on to give the encouraging \u2014 and I assume, incredibly scientific \u2014 statistic that it is only necessary to do 10% of work, and let the universe sort out the rest.I can understand the appeal of this line of thinking \u2014 I mean, who really wants to do more than 10% of work, anyway? But look! You can simply put your wish into the world, sit back and wait for it to deliver when you\u2019re ready to receive it. In the meantime, you can go and take a nap or whatever.As a belief, this is incredibly close to how I was taught at my Opus Dei Catholic School to ask God for the things you want. If you don\u2019t get them, it\u2019s because you\u2019re not praying hard enough. On the other hand, it could be because God know they\u2019re not what\u2019s best for you.My 12-year-old self questioned the flawed logic behind this: how were you supposed to know, for example, whether you needed to pray harder for something or stop praying for it altogether? (My 12-year-old self was sent out of class a lot.)I find it fascinating that we\u2019ve replaced the idea of \u201cgod\u201d with \u201cthe universe\u201d, but the wellness industry has still co-opted the language of religion. If you don\u2019t get what you ask for, it\u2019s because you\u2019re being impatient and ungrateful. Where God used to have a plan for us, now the universe does. Where we used to pray, now we manifest.Which would be all well and good, I suppose, if that could in any way be true for anyone except the world\u2019s most privileged. I\u2019ve had arguments with people who subscribe to the \u201cmanifest your destiny\u201d doctrine where they\u2019ve displayed a shocking lack of awareness about their own privilege. \u201cBut I\u2019m not rich!\u201d they protest, as they shell out $25 for brunch\u2014 ignoring the fact that they\u2019re born with an Australian passport and more than one option for how to spend their life.I\u2019ve engaged in nonsensical arguments about how an asylum seeker who flees war and ends up locked in a detention centre could possibly manifest their destiny. Did they not want it enough, despite literally risking life and limb to pursue their goal? Is being subjected to inhumane treatment the universe\u2019s \u201cplan\u201dfor them? Does the universe enlist Western governments to enact this cruel and senseless plan on its behalf?In which case, what on earth is the universe thinking?So many millions of people in the world are working as hard as they can (more than 10%!) just to survive and escape the terrible situations they find themselves in. When you talk about \u201cmanifesting your destiny\u201d, all you are manifesting is your own ignorance of how damn lucky you are to even think you have a destiny.Now pull your socks up, and do the other 90% of the work.Like my writing?

I\u2019d had chronic allergic rhinitis for years and no sense of smell. My hormones were also a nightmare.I also didn\u2019t know I was depressed. But the fact I spent 3 weeks of every month having mood swings and feeling low should\u2019ve been a clue.Not having a sense of smell in itself me miserable. It affected my taste and made life feel 2D. Aside from allergies, there was no apparent reason for my anosmia.On my last trip to the doctors, I\u2019d received the all-clear on an MRI head scan. As I explained how I was struggling, he suggested anti-depressants. It was the first time I\u2019d been offered them.But the stubborn part of me said no. I thought there must be something else I could try. I\u2019d seen a Nutritionalist a few months before and had a follow-up a few weeks later.So I left without a prescription.I\u2019d been to see a Nutritionalist following the encouragement of a friend.At my first appointment, I brought my food diary and explained my symptoms. We talked through my medical history and I brought up my teenage problem of thrush.She scribbled down Candida.I was definitely no stranger to Candida. I\u2019d suffered with thrush so badly in my teens, growing resistant over time to all the prescriptions. In the end my Mum had taken me to see a kinesiologist.At the time I was 14 and was advised to cut down sugar. But whilst I don\u2019t particularly recall changing my diet, over the following years it had mostly receded.Whilst the Nutritionalist didn\u2019t dwell too much on on Candida, my food diary \u2014 she noted \u2014 was seriously lacking in green veg and I was eating a fair amount of processed food.She suggested I incorporate more plants into my diet, recommended supplements for my hormones, and that was that.She\u2019d see me again in 6 months.The Nutritionalist follow up appointment drew near.Whilst I\u2019d made little effort on upgrading my diet, I was looking forward to at least getting her opinion on my mental health.The conversation with the doctor was playing on my mind \u2014 was I really so bad I needed anti-depressants?I was at work when I got an email cancelling my follow-up appointment with the Nutritionalist.This had been my last shred of hope, and now it was gone.But as I mentioned, I\u2019m stubborn. And I\u2019m also great at giving myself a talking to when needed. It occurred to me.Here I was expecting strangers to take responsibility for fixing me, when perhaps I should be tackling the problems myself?I\u2019d been so half hearted with the diet. I was sceptical that food could influence mood and my senses.Perhaps this was an opportunity to get my own shit together.I spent the weekend googling Candida, and was shocked by what I read.Candida Overgrowth was a thing and whilst not medically recognised, I had many of the symptoms it listed.The solution was also simple. It wouldn't require any prescriptions \u2014 all I had to do was cut sugar and yeast from my diet for several weeks. This would kill off the fungus.I decided to begin the detox on Monday.I always thought I ate a fairly healthy diet.It wasn\u2019t until I started analysing everything that was to pass between my lips, however, that I realised my mistake.As a busy working woman, I\u2019d often opt for a shove-in-the-oven after a long day. I chose Tesco Finest ready meals and Sainsbury\u2019s Taste The Difference, assuming these \u2018top of the range\u2019 ready-meals were healthy.But it wasn\u2019t until I started looking at labels that I realised I was wrong. Processed food \u2014 and most surprisingly, savoury food \u2014 had added sugar. And often a lot.On top of the weekly Haribo and Galaxy family bags, when I added up my previous \u2018healthy\u2019 diet, I saw I was eating far more sugar than I anticipated. Glasses of orange juice, fruit, baguettes from Pret A Manger \u2014 sugar was everywhere.I was easily racking up 18+ teaspoons a day when the recommended amount \u2014 published by the World Health Organisation \u2014 was 6.The detox was horrific.My new diet consisted of steamed chicken and green vegetables, everyday for a month. To avoid added sugar, I discovered I had to cook everything from scratch. Alcohol was also banned.As I did more reading, I slowly educated myself on the different types of sugar \u2014 discovering that even dried fruit should be avoided in quantity. It was a minefield.I couldn\u2019t believe that as a relatively well-educated woman, here I was discovering just how prevalent sugar had become in the typical diet. And I was shocked as I discovered the health implications weren\u2019t just limited to Candida.Whilst it was obvious that over-consumption of sugar could lead to diabetes, obesity and tooth decay, I was surprised to learn it was linked to cancer, heart disease, depression, ageing and acne.The more I read, the more I got angry.The first week of the detox nearly killed me.I\u2019d read about Candida die-off when I\u2019d done my research, but wasn\u2019t prepared for how awful it would be.As the fungi are starved of nutrients (i.e. sugar and yeast) they release toxins as they perish. Initially all your symptoms flare up and appear to get worse.One particular night during that first week, I actually thought I was going to die.I lay awake all night. I could hear blood rushing round my body and every cell inside me hurt. My nose streamed a clear fluid constantly and I felt like I was burning from the inside out.When the sun came up in the morning, I wanted to physically hurt myself. I cried hysterically, wanting to smash my nose into my face.It was the lowest moment.That day I managed to limp through work. I kept my head down and wondered what the hell I was doing and why I was attempting this on my own.A few weeks in, my cold-turkey-like state started to pass.Every night I slept a little better and I knew there was finally a glimmer of light at the end of a very dark tunnel.So I carried on.I remember the three-week mark.I had been sugar, yeast and alcohol free for 21 days. It was Saturday morning and I woke-up early to find myself feeling utterly different.It was like waking up from years of hibernation or emerging from a chrysalis.I looked in the mirror and knew that instant life was going to be different. Better. I had goosebumps.I felt motivated, fresh, unstoppable.I also looked a hell of a lot better.In three short weeks I\u2019d lost weight and my skin was the clearest I\u2019d ever seen it. I knew I was onto something.And by the end of the first month, I felt like I\u2019d discovered the elixir of life.By now, my productivity and focus at work was off the chart. When I\u2019d read about Candida before the detox, one symptom \u2014 brain fog \u2014 came up. Whilst I\u2019d heard of it, I had no idea that I was suffering.But now I realised that I had been completely fogged. Whereas previously I needed 10 cups of tea and plenty of procrastination before I completed a task, I now found I sat and focussed immediately.Presentations that used to take me a day, I could now complete in hours.I had more energy than I knew what to do with.I channeled this into raising awareness about the effects of sugar and set about on a mobile app to change the world.As the months progressed, I noticed myself changing even further.I actively sought out healthy food. I had seemingly rewired my taste buds. No longer was I craving sweets like I used to \u2014 instead I found myself fantasising about avocados.I was still cooking everything from scratch, I\u2019d developed a whole new range of low-sugar meals, I was mostly off the booze and threw myself into my app project.The more I read about sugar, the more infuriated I became about processed food. Whilst many consumers were chasing low-fat, manufacturers were adding sugar to keep food tasty.I was alarmed to read that sugar was proven to be more addictive than cocaine. We were unknowingly becoming a nation of sugar addicts.I was one of them.3 months in and my hormones were unrecognisable.I\u2019d gone from extreme PMT to barely noticing mood swings. On top of this, as my diet became more naturally wholesome, I immediately recognised when certain foods or drinks aggravated me.Over time, I learned I was sensitive to dairy and could only tolerate small amounts of animal protein.But most incredibly, my sense of smell was back.It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it was there.I\u2019d wake up in the morning and be able to smell the world around me. I realised how much I\u2019d been missing \u2014 food tasted like something else, the smell of flowers in bloom, the smell of aftershave on my partner.The world was once again in 3D.My allergies had pretty much disappeared. That following summer was the first year I didn\u2019t take antihistamines for hay fever which had plagued me my whole life.3 years on and it\u2019s no surprise that I\u2019m still living a low-sugar lifestyle.What I learned about processed food and the effects of too much sugar taught me the importance of being conscious about everything that goes into my body.I\u2019m no way as strict as I was back in the beginning. I eat a bit of fruit, drink alcohol occasionally and have sweet treats on gym days.But I know I need to watch what I eat and drink \u2014 it would be easy for Candida to go wild again if I went back to old ways.But given the changes in my life, I\u2019m just not interested in going back. I know that caring about what I put into my body makes all the difference to my health and wellbeing.Of course, I still have the odd grey day \u2014 but nothing that a bit of exercise and a hug can\u2019t cure.I\u2019m so relieved I never took up the doctors offer of anti-depressants.It\u2019s my opinion based on experience that healing the body can be possible through conscious eating.Written byWritten by","15600":"Now you are not the morning or the lightand I am just a shadow in duressstill raising tired arms to fight a fightand praying that some distant soul\u2019s impressedfor comfort have I sought \u2014 not anymore,I am resigned to rising with the dayand holding on: though hope may slam its doorsand I am stuck with bitter dreams that playacross my eyelids \u2014 love, accomplishment,success, and wealth \u2014 a spirit kept aloftwhile here (this brief and often lonely stintthat hardens hopeless souls.)

He\u2019d been acting out of character, including humiliating my mother by leaving his surprise 40th birthday party to check on his \u201csick\u201d secretary. He swore that he wasn\u2019t being unfaithful. I told him that if he were lying, I would never forgive him. So when my mother sat me down four months later to tell me of his infidelities, I simply replied, \u201cI know\u201d.What followed was an all-too-typical marriage break-up, but with the sickening twist that he told all of his relatives that my mum was the one who\u2019d cheated. And just like that, they disowned her, my brother and me.That was just one of the many heart-breaking, vile, and unforgivable things that he did to assign blame to anyone but himself. As a teenager, I was completely lost, and I reacted with rage. My anger began to define me \u2014 I shut down, trusted no one and threw myself into a lifestyle of drinking, smoking and anything I could to numb the pain.As a husband, he had failed, but as a father, I naively thought he would step up, behave morally and continue to support our upbringing. But he declared bankruptcy, and the closest thing I got to child support was a cheque in the post for \u00a316 on my 16th birthday. I can still vividly remember ripping it up without a moment\u2019s hesitation.He tried to mend our fractured relationship every so often, but each time he would simply unload new lies and blame different people. Not once did he apologise for a thing \u2014 it was bewildering to me and I would leave each meeting with a head full of stories that I would then have to process and unravel. Needless to say, I was a mess each and every time.He remarried and I was a stepdaughter and stepsister to a family I didn\u2019t want to know. They seemed like lovely people and I yearned to tell them how narcissistic and damaging this man was. But they looked at him with love and acceptance, and who was I to burst that bubble?With sad predictability, he ruined their lives too and moved on to the third unsuspecting wife-to-be. Two months before their wedding day, he called with promises of mending what was broken between us \u2014 the calls kept coming and slowly, I started to believe that a tenth of what he was saying may be true. So with a tiny sense of hope, I attended the wedding and smiled for the photos. He hugged me tightly at the end of that day, told me he loved me and promised to call me after his honeymoon.The call was horrific. He told me he\u2019d done a lot of thinking and concluded that I needed help and to call him when I was better. All of those promises and that false hope had just been to trick me to attend the wedding and behave in front of his new family. My last ever words to him were \u201cDon\u2019t hold your breath\u201d. That was 18 years ago.The mixture of emotions was immediate \u2014 rage, betrayal, and shock flooded my body. I went into a dark, dark place and the internal battle that followed was messy. Had I made the wrong choice by cutting him out of my life? I was lost, confused and had a constant pain in my stomach. What had I done?Most of my family and friends told me I would regret my choice, but deep down I didn\u2019t believe them. The guilt took about a year to leave, clinging on for longer than expected. Every time a family member would pose a question like \u201cHow would you feel if he dies?\u201d I would wrestle with my conscience for ages.Friends who had lost a parent berated me \u2014 one of them had a full-on meltdown in the middle of a pub, calling me selfish, ungrateful and heartless. What they would only give for five precious minutes with their loved one! I hated myself for causing them such pain but their anger eventually subsided as they saw a happier me.Each day without his toxicity, I grew stronger, calmer and more confident. Eventually, the self-loathing and feelings of regret completely faded and were replaced with a reassurance that the decision I had made was healthy and positive.They too were being guilted into holding on to a blood relative out of a sense of duty, but to me, blood isn\u2019t thicker than water when that blood is poisonous.Carla Rose, LCSWR, is a psychotherapist specialising in mental health counselling. She believes \u201cit is healthier to distance oneself from a toxic family member than to try and pretend everything is ok.\u201d She goes on to say, \u201cWe don\u2019t choose our family, we are born into it. Why would we allow negative energy from family that we wouldn\u2019t tolerate from people we choose to be around?\u201dWhilst this was the hardest decision of my life, I know that the alternative would have been so much worse \u2014 decades of toxicity would have crushed me and turned me into a person filled with pain, anger and resentment.As I walked down the aisle in June, I paused for a fleeting moment to acknowledge his absence and then moved forward with my head held high.Originally published at https:\/\/www.tyla.com on October 11, 2019.Written byWritten by","15780":"I recently wrote about my weight loss, and the trouble that I\u2019m having with it. And I think I finally touched onto one of the reasons that I\u2019m struggling with it so much.I keep expecting to see somebody new in the mirror.For the vast majority of people, a loss of 77 pounds* would be drastic. (I\u2019m assuming I\u2019ve lost more since I wrote that, since I\u2019m losing at about a rate of a pound and a half a day. But it\u2019s not official until I step on the doctor\u2019s scale.) You would see that kind of loss on their body. Hell, most people would look like a completely new person. But I just look like me.The same ol\u2019Oompa-Loompa me. Judge for yourself:Sure, I feel a little bit better since I\u2019ve taken that picture. I can walk a little bit further without having to stop. But I don\u2019t trust my own subjective experience of my body. I hate my body too much for that. What I feel doesn\u2019t matter.Instead, I\u2019m looking for some kind of external proof. Whether that comes in the difference in how people treat me, or just the fact that I look noticeably different in the mirror.With 99 people out of 100, this much weight loss would be absolutely transformational. They would see something for all of the effort that they\u2019ve put in. They would already be a completely and totally different person.I\u2019m still me. No changes yet.And seeing that change would create a kind of positive feedback loop. When you can see something good happening, that serves as a kind of intrinsic positive feedback look.Recently, my dear friend Shannon wrote about how much she\u2019s struggled with being on a diet similar to the one that I\u2019m on, and it\u2019s beginning to click: it\u2019s a easy to realize that you need to make a change in your life, but it\u2019s really damn hard to keep making that change continually, especially when you\u2019re not seeing any kind of change.It\u2019s so easy to throw up your hands and say fuck this nonsense! Especially when there\u2019s something really tempting about the temporary comfort that exists at the bottom of a party-sized bag of peanut butter M&Ms.I felt like that needed to be in big letters.At this point, I\u2019ve invested too damn much into this process. I\u2019ve made myself too damn miserable for too damn long, just to relapse back into my old ways. Even if I do want to eat an entire carrot cake and lick the cream cheese frosting off of my fingers.I\u2019m not kidding. Junk food has a lot of real estate in my brain, especially while I\u2019m not eating it. I don\u2019t know if that will ever change. I hope it does.But for now, I\u2019ve got to keep taking one difficult day after another, and keep waiting for that different me in the mirror.I hope he shows up soon.Zach J.

But completely, overwhelmingly, \u201cI SHOULD FEEL GREAT BUT I DON\u2019T\u201d, exhausted.Here\u2019s what that looks like from my Nokia sleep tracker (I\u2019ve been tacking my sleep for 1.5 years now):This is what inefficient sleep looks like. 10+ hours in bed. Barely any deep sleep, especially in 1st half of the night, with multiple interruptions.In fact, I\u2019ve spent 2 weekends with 10+ hours each night and 7+ hours on the weekdays. And I\u2019m continually waking up exhausted and crashing in the afternoon.I haven\u2019t felt rested in months. And I\u2019ve been getting the same amount of sleep as I always have (if not more). So\u2026what\u2019s going on?!You\u2019re probably aware that we go through different sleep stages through the night, with REM being the most well known and researched. But there\u2019s a stage before REM called N3.N3 sleep = deep sleep = slow-wave sleep = Delta sleep.It\u2019s (surprisingly) a technical term with a clear definition and measurement (presence of delta waves).Nothing short of magic \u2014 during N3 your body goes through cellular rebuilding and repair \u2014 builds bone and muscle, repairs and regenerates tissues, creating and storing memories, processing learnings from the day, and more. While REM is more emotional processing, deep sleep is critical for truly recovering and repairing the body including detoxifying the brain. It\u2019s crucial for both hormonal regulation and physical renewal. In short, we need this. There\u2019s no such thing as too much deep sleep.You have more N3 sleep in the first half of the night than the second half. REM is the opposite \u2014 getting longer as you proceed through the night.Have you heard sleeping in a cold room can help you sleep deeper? In N3 sleep, your body drops to the lowest temperature during the night \u2014 so providing an environment for your body to get and stay cool is key. [NIH, 2012]Short term, your body is not physically repairing or mentally processing the day and you\u2019re not going to feel rested at all. Long term is even worse. Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, heart disease, stroke\u2026the connections between lack of N3 sleep and chronic illness goes on and on.I\u2019ve become obsessed with understanding and experimenting with my own N3 sleep. So what affects N3 sleep? How can we hack it? How do we know if we\u2019re not getting enough?But for now, we\u2019re left to experiment on our own.So let me be SUPER clear, everything beyond this sentence is my own personal experience and detective work \u2014 though rooted in as much science as I could find, of course.\ud83d\ude34Not Feeling Rested: I don\u2019t feel rested when I wake up, no matter how many hours I sleep.\ud83c\udf35Stiffness: My body is sore in the mornings \u2014 as if I had lifted heavy weights the day before.\ud83d\udd25Temperature: I don\u2019t have AC and it\u2019s been extremely hot at night. I often wake up drenched in sweat.\u23efInterruptions: I\u2019m waking up multiple times a night, especially in the first half, when I should be falling into deep N3 sleep. I\u2019m much more sensitive to light & sound than I was a few months ago- which makes me think I\u2019m spending more time in light sleep stages.\ud83e\udde0 Cognition: I\u2019m having trouble processing thoughts or remembering even what I ate for lunch yesterday.

At the very least, it\u2019s tracking me moving quite a bit through the night \u2014 which shouldn\u2019t be happening during N3 sleep.Moments like last Saturday morning \u2014 I wake up feeling like I\u2019ve failed myself. I \u201cwasted\u201d 10+ hours \u201cnot doing anything\u201d. 10+ hours sleeping and not rested from it. Increasing hours isn\u2019t doing anything. Anyone else with me?Something needs to change.

A couple weeks ago while glued to my laptop at precisely this time, I came across a Youtube video called \u201c7 DAY WATER FAST \u2014 NO FOOD OR DRINK FOR A WEEK.\u201d It had a whopping 7.4 million views.Though sleepiness was beginning to set in and the video was a bit longer than I would have liked, I decided to watch; I was intrigued. How could a person only drink water for a week? What sort of insane willpower would drive this kind of self-torture?The video depicted the experience of a man called Lou who decided to only drink water for a full week, in hopes it would help cure his chronic aches and pains stemming from rheumatoid arthritis. Great, I thought, another pop science nutrition fad with no real empirical backing. Surely it\u2019s one of those things that people label as a miracle cure, only to find out years later it actually causes permanent damage to your body. Like diet pills or fruit-only meal plans.But as I kept watching video, the idea of water fasting started to grow on me. After Lou\u2019s 7 day fast, the guy went from experiencing debilitating daily back pain to having absolutely no pain at all. Interest piqued, I decided to do more in-depth research on the concept of water-fasting. And things began to make sense. I found multiple scientific studies from established sources backing up the idea of fasting, as well as articles written by doctors and nutritionists praising it for its benefits.At that\u2019s when I decided, at 5am, that I was going to do a water fast.Fasting has become increasingly popular in the US today. According to MedicalNewsToday and the New York Times, fasting dates back thousands of years, having been historically practiced all around the word for spiritual and religious reasons. However, it is only more recently that fasting has emerged in pop-culture as a part of the wellness and mindfulness movement. People often pair fasting with mindfulness practices like meditation.You may be familiar with intermittent fasting, a feeding method endorsed by celebrities like Hugh Jackman, where a person eats all their meals in a small window of time \u2014 typically within 8 hours. Water fasting is similar, except it extends that fasting period for multiple days. Water fasting is exactly what it sounds like. No juices, teas, gum, food of any kind during the fasting period; literally nothing except water. The exception is that you can ingest salt and potassium to avoid feeling dizzy and keep electrolytes in balance.Based on the blogs I read of water-fasting experiences, I found that people typically do water fasts for 3\u201314 days (although some claim to have fasted for upwards of 30 days!). Doctors recommended fasting for 3\u20137 days to feel optimal benefits.So, what benefits exactly does water-fasting claim to offer? After browsing multiple medical information sites (like this one and this one), news articles (like this one by the New York Times), personal blogs (like this one and this one), and articles posted by doctors (like this one and this one), I discovered that water fasting is purported to have multiple health benefits, many of which are backed by science. Though there is some debate in the medical community as to whether fasting is a sustainable and safe method of weight loss and detox (and whether it damages metabolism), there is emerging evidence that fasting has short and long-term health benefits. These benefits are listed below.Research shows that fasting promotes a detoxification process called autophagy by putting the body under stress. Scientists believe this occurs as a protective mechanism, increasing during times of stress (like fasting) to help us get through tough times. During autophagy, the body cleans and recycles old cellular materials, undergoing a detox. It may reduce risk of cancer by cleaning out old cells at risk for mutations.Director of the Longevity Institute at USC, Valter Longo, conducted a fasting study on mice. The study demonstrated that 2\u20135 days of fasting each month reduced biomarkers for diabetes, cancer and heart disease, perhaps due to lowering levels of insulin and certain growth factors.If you aren\u2019t convinced by mice studies, there is also human-based scientific evidence for this phenomenon. Krista Varady, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, conducted alternate day fasting trials lasting up to 10 weeks with obese adults, finding marked reductions in LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and insulin. These biomarkers are linked to diabetes and heart disease.Fasting promotes ketosis, a process in which your body switches from burning carbs for fuel to burning fat for fuel. Once your body depletes all of its stashed sugar (stored as glycogen), your body has no choice but to begin dipping into fast reserves. The more fat you burn, the more weight you lose. Many of the water-fasting experience blogs I read reported losing up to 20 pounds of weight (some of it water-weight) in only 5 days!Fasting has been shown to improve neurological disorders like epilepsy. Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at Harvard, argues that ketones produced by water-fasting have significant positive effects on the brain, particularly for those suffering from epileptic seizures.\u201cThere are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets,\u201d said Dr. Ludwig to the New York Times. \u201cIf it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.\u201dFasting has also been linked to increased levels of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a growth factor which helps with cognitive related deficiencies and supports growth, differentiation, and survival of neuronal cells. This may be why people often report augmented mental clarity while fasting \u2014 something described in all of the blogs I read.Small-scale studies have shown that fasting can improve auto-immune disorders (at least in the short-term) like rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. If you recall, the original water-fasting YouTube video I watched involved a man with rheumatoid trying to cure his chronic pain.All these benefits sounded great \u2014 weight loss, improved mental health and clarity, decreased anxiety, increased longevity. Who wouldn\u2019t want all those things?However, three of the potential benefits stood out to me. These were my primary reasons for completing the water-fast:So, with these goals in mind \u2014 and a final buffet dinner in my stomach \u2014 I decided to embark on a 7 day water fast. I wanted to jump right in with a longer fast to test my willpower and feel optimal benefits. I completed this fast alongside my twin sister, which was a HUGE help; I don\u2019t think I could have gotten through it without her moral support.My 7-day fast pushed my mental and physical limits. As you probably guessed, not eating for 7 days is an extreme test of willpower.On the water fast, I drank WATER ONLY. Some people add in tea or broth, but I stuck to water. The only extracurricular ingesting I did was adding salt and minerals in to keep electrolytes in balance.Although some recommend avoiding use of toiletries (no soap, toothpaste, and lotions during the fast) because these products can leach through the skin and be metabolized by your body, that felt too extreme to me. I bathed, washed, and lotioned as normal. I also exercised normally.The fast began around 7pm on a Wednesday evening and ended on 7pm the following Wednesday. I chose to do the fast during this time because I\u2019m currently on a break between grad school and my first full-time job (eeek!), so I don\u2019t have many commitments that might be derailed.It\u2019s now been about a week since I\u2019ve ended the fast, and I wanted to reflect on my experience and takeaways.Like I said, fasting was tough. The toughest parts were:In spite of all the onerous parts of fasting, there were also many amazing benefits. What\u2019s more, these many of these benefits persisted after the fast ended (I\u2019ll write more about post-fast experience in another article). The good parts of fasting were:For those of you who are interested, I have included a stream-of-consciousness daily breakdown of my fasting experience.Weight: 140.0 lbsNotes: Felt fine, nothing much to report. Honestly very easy to not eat because I was so full from the giant buffet I ate the night before. Mostly just experiencing boredom from not eating food.Weight: 138.0 lbsNotes: High energy, very productive. Low anxiety. Some hunger pangs. Really, really bored without food. I\u2019m not even that hungry, just want some kind of stimulation. Also noticed that I had trouble sleeping. Didn\u2019t fall asleep until like 5am.Weight: 134.6 lbs Notes: Agitated in morning. Still felt okay energy wise, albeit a little spacey. Went rock climbing and felt euphoric\/energy boosted after. Great mood, basically no anxiety. Much harder to climb than normal; my limbs were EXTREMELY shaky.Weight: 134.1 lbsNotes: Low energy. No anxiety still, but tired and shaky. Exercise was weirdly easy \u2014 like my legs were numb. No hunger, but cravings for certain flavors felt even more intense. Sense of smell was heightened. Began noticing food EVERYWHERE.Weight: 132.0 lbs Notes: Less hungry. Slower speech, Energy coming in waves. Pretty tired overall though. Body was lethargic but brain was alert; felt focus and sharpness mentally once I rallied myself enough to work on a task. Could not fall asleep until 6am. Spent a lot of time looking up pictures of food.Weight: 131.6Notes: Woke up feeling ok, better than other days. Probably the most (mental) energy and focus I had. Really no hunger at all. Food fantasizing decreased. Again, moderately tired but mentally sharp. Zero anxiety, which is amazing.Weight: 129.2Notes: The final day! Extreme tiredness is back. Very dizzy. Eating dinner was AMAZING. Everything tasted super salty and flavorful. Really wanted carbs, tried to refrain. Went to the dentist and he commented that my blood pressure was ideal. That\u2019s a plus, because it\u2019s normally too high.A 7-day water fast may not be for everyone; it requires extreme dedication and restraint, which may not be conducive to certain work schedules or environments.Completing a fast helped me restore my control over eating habits and pushed me to become less reliant on food as a source of entertainment and pleasure...for now at least. Though it did result in some sleepless nights, lethargy, and an almost painful level of boredom, I think it\u2019s safe to say the benefits outweighed the drawbacks (at least in my opinion). I feel like my body and brain have been reset \u2014 I have less anxiety, more mental clarity, and better skin. I have a renewed sense of ownership over my health, and a healthier, more appreciative relationship with food. Hopefully it lasts!One thing to note: if you are just doing a water fast JUST to lose weight, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. You mostly just lose water weight, and the weight can come back on rather quickly if you don\u2019t watch what you eat. That said, it is good if you want to re-evaluate your relationship to food and get a fresh start for a new diet!Written byWritten by","15845":"One of the best places to go for new training ideas is the past. Trust me. It\u2019s been done before and better. The more time I spend researching the means and methods of the past, the more I have come to realize that, try as we might, there is nothing new going on in fitness. If you think you\u2019ve stumbled onto a new protocol the chances are you just haven\u2019t read enough to cite its real inventor. We are simply getting into the game too late. Almost every \u201cnew\u201d workout is actually just a rebranded version of something that has already been done before.Everything has already been done\u2026it\u2019s our job to do it one better. -Stanley KubrickThis is no different. One of the best new mass programs I have been using is actually a staple of classic bodybuilders. They knew the value of high rep squats. Very few people do these today and it\u2019s not because they don\u2019t work. Most people have never tried this approach simply because it is too hard.Before the advent of most anabolic steroids, high rep squats were a staple of classic bodybuilding. Whether or not one is looking to become a bodybuilder, everyone should be looking to add muscle. If you\u2019re not convinced of this yet. you should do some other reading. This post is for those who have already seen the light. Even if our goals are not to walk the stage in a banana hammock, the fact remains that bodybuilders have performed some of the most thorough human trials on how to add muscle and anyone can and should learn from their example. Especially from those from the old school who built impressive amounts of muscle without steroids.Their results and methods are far more relevant to the population of fitness enthusiasts who are also, not on steroids. I say this all the time and it\u2019s worth mentioning at least once more, I do not care if you are taking steroids or not. The point is that people on steroids can and should train differently than those who are not on steroids. Bold stuff. If you\u2019re not on steroids, you shouldn\u2019t copy the methods of people who are. It is an issue of physiology, not morality that I am speaking to. The fitness space does a terrible job with transparency and many of the most popular programs and splits are designed and performed by steroid users. If a natural athlete attempts such a split, it simply will not align with the lifter\u2019s physiology and he could simply get better results by using programming better suited to his physiology.If you\u2019re not on steroids, you shouldn\u2019t copy the methods of people who are.Full disclosure, I do not work with bodybuilders or fitness competitors. I hang out and have worked with a bunch and while I\u2019m sure a few of them could also benefit from this program, this message and really almost everything that I do is not intended for them. I work with real people who predominantly have gone pro at other things besides their physique. If they are on supplements they are getting them from the vitamin shop, not the dark web. This program and everything I put out is designed first and foremost for these people. Natural and \u201cenhanced\u201d athletes have different training needs and I am best suited to speak to the former than the latter.Now that we know who this program is ideally suited to, let\u2019s jump into the specifics. What exactly is meant by high rep squats? Pretty broad and open to interpretation as is. When I say high rep squats, I mean sets of 20 or more repetitions with a load normally used for a set of 8\u201312 reps. WTF? That is exactly how I felt the first time I read about this method myself.How does that work? These sets will not look like your typical workout. Adjust the tempo. Get a rep, take a few breathes, and go again. Reps 1\u201310 should be pretty easy, but between 12\u201320 you\u2019re actually going to have to work. What I have learned in applying these sets is that success or failure is 100% in your head. While this looks like leg training, the mind is going to be the most important muscle. Yes, I know the mind isn\u2019t really a muscle, but it\u2019s still the most important tissue used in high rep squats. I have squeezed out 25 reps when I thought for sure I was done at 12. Do not rerack the weight because it feels hard. Take your time. Take another breath. Get another rep when you can. You may take as long as 10 seconds in between reps. This may take a while and that is an important part of the process.This is part of the magic of high rep squats sets. Working in this fashion one will accumulate a good number of reps at medium to high intensity and accumulate a TON of time under tension. Time under tension is the amount of time a muscle is under stress during an exercise. Most people are accustomed to thinking about intensity and volume, monitoring the load and repetitions, but time under tension is another important variable. In low rep high-intensity work, there is relatively little time under tension. This type of work is excellent for improving strength and performance but is not optimal for gaining muscle. The answer isn\u2019t always to put more weight on the bar or squeezing out more reps, increasing time under tension is another variable we should be thinking about when training to gain muscle.Muscle gains will not only be limited to the muscles directly being trained. Want to put some size on your upper body? Squat. It is not uncommon for someone implementing high rep squats to make upper body gains as well. How\u2019s that possible? The squat is a compound movement requiring the coordinated effort of multiple muscles to perform, nearly every muscle in the body. Obviously the muscles of the legs are working, but the musculature of the core and upper back are also engaged in constant tension. The anabolic response generated from big compound movements will increase the natural production of growth hormone and testosterone. Big compound lifts like the squat send a strong signal to build muscle. The effect will not only be localized to the legs, but the entire body will also benefit. For natural athletes, high rep squats and 9-hour naps may just be the best available anabolic supplements. I encourage both.If you\u2019re at all like me, hearing this may inspire you to add high rep squats to every workout. If some is good, then more is better. Right? This is a hard NO. High reps squats are VERY demanding. They will tax your body and central nervous system. Let\u2019s be honest, their difficulty is why most people avoid them in the first place. This is not an easy program at all. If you are one of the few with the fortitude to endure a high rep set, don\u2019t fry yourself doing them every workout. I know how you like to roll.Working high rep squats 1\u20133 times per week is all that is necessary. More is not necessarily better, choose the right dose! Determining how often to deploy this strategy depends on one\u2019s experience and goals. The primary reason for implementing high rep squats is to gain muscle. If your goal is to get stronger or improve performance, there are going to be better rep schemes to achieve your goal. If you are new to training, starting out at once a week will be more than enough to send a strong signal to build muscle. If you have more experience, you will be able to tolerate a bit more but everyone should take a break after about 6 weeks of training regardless of your experience.More is not necessarily better, choose the right dose!The original high rep squat protocol has one training the lift 3 times per week on non-consecutive days. One tip from the original program that many will find beneficial is to incorporate straight-arm pullovers after squatting. Breath is going to be incredibly important in high rep sets and the straight-arm pullover helps expand the rib cage and increase the efficiency of breathing. You\u2019re going to need some time to recover after the set anyway. Why not throw in a non-competing movement that will help your main lift?High rep squats are best performed with the barbell back squat. I do not recommend using other variations of the movement for this strategy. Front squats are great and I use them all the time but not with high rep sets. Fatigue often starts the muscle of the upper back and often proves to be the limiting factor in high rep sets. With a front squat, the legs will often not get the opportunity to work to their full capacity. Some people like the smith machine but I am not one of them. These people tend to be bodybuilders and while it is certainly a great way to be able to focus and feel the muscle, as a functional trainer who works with athletes and regular folks predominantly, I have no use for the smith machine as such.If you had to use something other than the classic barbell back squat then we may use a leg press, but this is still a very distant second option for me. The truth is. if you can\u2019t barbell back squat you have more pressing issues than gaining muscle whether you realize it or not. If you can not perform a basic lift, this is a strong sign that your mobility and movement need more work. Shelving your physique goals until you have achieved the requisite mobility to use the best muscle building exercises will improve your gains in the long run, even if it means you have to come out of the gate a little slower. A huge part of my job working with real people is identifying small issues before they become bigger problems. The inability to perform a basic movement is a great sign of mobility issues.Implementing high rep squats is easy. If you are a natural athlete, hopefully, you already know that part splits are not the best option for your physique goals. I know everyone starts out here, I sure did, but these methods are optimal for enhanced lifters, not the natural athlete. Ideally, the natural athlete is working either total body workouts, an upper\/lower split, or a push\/pull\/leg movement based split. These splits will all allow for greater frequency training each muscle group versus a part split and will give the natural athlete better results than if he were to isolate and train each muscle group only once per week.Most total body programs are training 3 to 4 times per week. Working high rep squats into this program is simple. Make your leg movement the squat and 1\u20133 times per week bring your lunch pail and get after it. It is generally a better idea to have your toughest workouts early in the week and stress and fatigue accumulate. For those of us with busy lives outside the gym by the end of the week, we\u2019re often more in need of recovery than a crushing workout.Do your toughest workouts first. Gym and life stress accumulate throughout the week.Toward that end, as you get stronger it is a good idea to move into a split, just not a part split. Upper\/lower and push\/pull\/legs are great options here. Once you are pressing 2 plates, squatting 3, and deadlifting 4 it\u2019s going to be a good idea to break up the work. At these levels of strength, we need to make sure to give adequate time for recovery, or all that work was for nothing. If opting for the upper\/lower split one is going to end up with either 2 or three upper and lower body sessions per week. One could work high rep squats every session for six weeks on such a split. Push\/pull\/legs are going to set up the same, depending on how frequently one is training, probably from 3 to 6 days per week, high rep squats can be incorporated on each leg day and it will break out 1\u20133 sessions per week. Intuitive and easy to program on any number of splits.The planning is easy. The execution is hard. However, anyone who chooses to work high rep squats into their program should have a few bases covered first. This is not a technique for beginners, you should have the requisite mobility and be very comfortable with the movement. If you don\u2019t, there are better ways you probably should be training. If you are comfortable with your squat and looking for a new challenge than implementing high rep squats is going to jump-start a wide range of benefits.Want to improve your cardiovascular endurance? Squat. Want to get bigger legs? Squat. Bigger upper body? Squat. Get leaner and defined? Squat? Just want to improve your mobility? Squat. Improve mental toughness and become a better all-around person? Squat, and squat a lot. The barbell squat is the king for a reason and the more you do it, within the parameters we\u2019ve already mentioned, achieving your fitness goals will become much easier.Written byWritten by","15850":"\u201cTHAT SUCKED!!\u201dDad threw my wrestling headgear down on the floor in a fury.I had just gotten destroyed in a wrestling match. I was in 8th grade. I should\u2019ve beaten the kid, but I wilted under the pressure that was the biggest match of the year.And here I was, in some back hallway at a high school I\u2019ve never heard of, hearing about how bad my performance was from my own father.Sure, my Dad could\u2019ve handled it better, but on the other hand, it was so, so good for me in hindsight.I dated a girl for a while who had a child.I remember being at her place one time right after she put her child down for a nap. I really loved her daughter, even though she was currently in her \u201cterrible two\u2019s\u201d and cried louder than a 747 taking off at least ten times a day.Every time my girlfriend put her daughter down to sleep, she\u2019d start crying.Within two minutes, my girlfriend would go in and ask her daughter, rather gently, whether she wanted to rock in the chair, get read a story, or play for a bit.\u201cI wanna get out of the crib!\u201d she\u2019d say.Then my girlfriend would try again.\u201cDo you want to rock in the cha \u2014 \u201d \u201cI WANNA GET OUT OF THE CRIB!\u201d*Sobs*These moments really made me angry for one sole reason: her daughter needed to learn to deal with it.I wasn\u2019t mad at the child \u2014 I was mad at my girlfriend because clearly she had been conditioning her daughter that if she cried in the crib long enough, she\u2019d get out to play with mommy.Weirdly though, I don\u2019t blame my ex-girlfriend much either. She loved her daughter more than anything. She\u2019s hearing her child cry. It would take a pretty cold person to not walk into that room and try to calm that precious gem of a tiny human down \u2014 especially when it\u2019s yours.Right?This is where the dilemma lies. So often in life what\u2019s best for us is the most painful option. It\u2019s tough for a mother not to console her daughter when she\u2019s acting up, but when you look deeper, my ex was basically rewarding defiance.What happens next week when they\u2019re in the store and her daughter wants candy but she says no? The daughter\u2019s going to cry her brains out because she\u2019s being conditioned that crying is the way to get what she wants.You\u2019re not always going to get what you want in life. In fact, you\u2019re going to get maybe 10% of what you want out of life if you\u2019re lucky.Let\u2019s be honest. I know nothing about parenting. I\u2019ve never been a father. For me to sit here and offer parenting advice feels a little weird, but at the same time, I am a living breathing human being capable of observing reality and making educated opinions about what I see.Second, I am a child. Therefore I know half the equation here. I know what worked for me, and as a 26-year-old who does a lot of self-reflection, I\u2019ve realized that certain things I hated when I was a pre-teen and teenager were actually the best things for me.I understand that there is no perfect way to parent. What works for one child might not work for another child.But there\u2019s one idea that I back 100 percent, and that\u2019s that your kids need to learn what struggle means.Michelle Obama said something a few years ago at a college commencement speech that really resonated with me.Michelle said that growing up without privilege gave the diverse, immigrant-heavy class in front of her an advantage that rich kids don\u2019t have: The perspective to know that \u201clife will put many obstacles in your path that are far worse than a bad grade.\u201dMichelle knew that struggle is actually good for us. It makes us find ways to deal with our problems \u2014 which is something no human can avoid, no matter if you have privilege or not.Depriving your kids from facing problems could result in them not being prepared for the world.My Dad yelling at me in a random hallway at some school I\u2019ve never been to because I didn\u2019t perform well in a sport played for fun doesn\u2019t seem deserved, but are most of the B.S. things we deal with in life deserved?Following this logic, wouldn\u2019t that mistake from my father actually be preparing me for the reality of life pretty well?If most of life\u2019s problems aren\u2019t deserved, then I was getting a front-row seat to that science lesson back in 8th grade. I learned it. I internalized it. Now when stuff happens to me that isn\u2019t deserved, I deal with it. I don\u2019t whine about it.Even when a parent is too overbearing, even when a parent screws us over in ways we never in a million years deserved, this can be used as a strength. I\u2019ve seen it happen over and over again.Children working hard as anything and accomplishing crazy things because their parents didn\u2019t show them much love. My girlfriend experienced that.My Father had terrible parents who never showed him the love he DESERVED, but yet he\u2019s one of the most kind, hard-working people I know. I think it\u2019s because he\u2019s subconsciously trying to prove something to his parents. He blew up at me in 8th grade because for a while he used my accomplishments in wrestling as proof that he was a good parent. He didn\u2019t know that he already was a good parent. He made mistakes, but he was on the whole a fantastic father.I have this weird theory that the children of malevolent parents actually make for pretty kind parents later on because they don\u2019t want to be like the crap parents they had.But then too much kindness and \u201cbabying\u201d from these \u201ckind parents\u201d makes for entitled children who know no struggle and think life is all about them \u2014 who turn into not-so-good parents themselves.Feel free to tear that theory apart, but I have a hunch this cycle can and does happen in certain instances.I\u2019m going to love my kids. I\u2019m going to have a lot of fun with them someday. I think I\u2019ll probably be a little less harsh on them than I\u2019m about to let on...But I do want to make them struggle. I don\u2019t want them to know much privilege. I\u2019m going to let my kid cry herself to sleep in the crib. Every night. Until they realize that crying isn\u2019t going to do anything.I\u2019m going to do things like beat them in games sometimes and show them that losing is a part of life just as much as winning is. I\u2019m going to say \u201cNO\u201d a lot.Unlike my ex, though, I will try my best not to feel bad, because I know that this struggle is good for them, like it was for me, and that this struggle will prepare them well for the rest of their lives.Written byWritten by","15886":"Close your eyes,Deep breaths,Feel the air fill your body,Imagine white lightFrom the universeReaching your soul.In through your nose,Out through your mouth.Picture roots sproutingFrom your feet,Grounding you to the earth.Feel the light shifting,Swirling, changingFrom white to purple.Welcome the light throughYour third eye,Entering with every breath,And leaving from the top of your head \u2014 The colour of your soul,Your key chakra,Your aura.See the light drifting upwards \u2014 To the gods,To the heavens,To the stars \u2014 Opening the lines of communication,Welcoming, holding hands,Connecting.Part of a monthly experiment to write 100 words first thing in the morning, before I even get out of bed.

Seriously.I could walk into the emergency room with half of my head removed, bleeding out of every wazoo, and my leg spontaneously combusting, and, no bullshit, they\u2019ll find some way to bring up my weight. Even if it has nothing to do with why I\u2019m there. Especially if it has nothing to do with why I\u2019m there.At 550 pounds, my weight is the elephant in the room. Hell, I\u2019m the elephant in the room. And doctors are very good at pointing out the obvious.With the kind of education they receive, you expect them to be good at noticing the obvious and having the tact not to mention it. It\u2019s the kind of bearing that\u2019s supposed to come with education; only stupid people are supposed to run their mouths.But no, put a fat person in a medical situation and, no matter what the actual problem is, the doctor will ask \u201chave you tried losing weight?\u201d like they\u2019ve just cracked the goddamn Da Vinci Code. It\u2019s got to be an impulse.Thankfully, I there was no spontaneous combustion this time. Just a nasty infection.After a few days of my friends asking if I wanted to go to the hospital to get my leg checked out \u2014 other than the swelling, it wasn\u2019t hurting too bad \u2014 I decided to go to the emergency room, even though I knew what was going to happen.I walk into a hospital with an infected leg and the doctor\u2019s first question is \u201cHave you tried losing weight?\u201dIt\u2019s kinda hard not to answer, \u201cOf course I have, asshole. That\u2019s why my other leg is so slim and pretty-looking!\u201dNot that I was even able to see how bad my leg was until my friend took that picture. I mean, I knew there was something wrong because of the swelling, but I couldn\u2019t see just how hideous it looked.So that\u2019s what all the fuss is about. Looks like something out of a R.L. Stine book.Better go see the doctor. Except, of course, the doctor can\u2019t help. After six hours, all they could tell me is that the swelling wasn\u2019t due to a blood clot, and that the infection would clear up with an antibiotic. And, of course, the usual advice. . .I\u2019m not stupid. I knew that I needed to lose weight before I went to see in Dr. Emergency McJackass, and the doctor before him, and the doctor before her . . . and so on.I know that I need to lose weight every time I read the words \u201cpatient\u2019s body habitus\u201d in a medical report, describing why the x-ray or the ultrasound or the MRI or the CT scan didn\u2019t work out as well as it\u2019s supposed to.I know it every time a medical professional asks if I can dress myself and wipe my own ass.I know it every time that at doctor or nurse assumes that I\u2019m too fat to understand what I\u2019m saying. Thankfully, I have a skinny friend willing to come along, so the doctors have someone they feel comfortable looking directly at while they talk. Anything to avoid looking at their fat patient.Let me reiterate that again. I\u2019m not stupid.I just get treated like it because I\u2019m a fat person.I\u2019m not one of those fat people that people feel comfortable around. I\u2019m not one of those fat people that\u2019s just a little too much, just outside of the limits of a normal human shape.I\u2019m the kind of fat person that gets treated like steerage.But, I\u2019m here.

That, in order to get to that impressively frightening weight, I must constantly be shoving high quantities of high sugar, high carbohydrate, high fat foods into my mouth.It\u2019s all my choice. It\u2019s all my fault.And so, I deserve all of the hate that comes my way.Most people are really good about veiling their hate as concern, especially if you know me. You might be worried about my health or looking out for me.You might think that I just don\u2019t know about Weight Watchers. Or Keto. Or whatever the fad diet du jour is.It\u2019s kind of naively cute that you think someone could exist in a fat body for any considerable length of time without being aware of every single lose-weight quick scheme. Like we haven\u2019t considered everything from ordering black market Ephedra from Columbia to outright starving ourselves.We see your \u201cconcern\u201d \u2014 mostly because a whole lot of people don\u2019t even try the disguise of concern.Maybe hate is too strong a word. But people are fast and easy with their judgments about fat people, especially super-fat people, and sometimes it does feel a lot like hate. It\u2019s really easy to read a malice into other people\u2019s behavior that isn\u2019t always there.They think that this body is a contract that I willingly entered into. That because I willingly put every single pound onto my body, that I must have known how I\u2019d be treated for it.And if I didn\u2019t want to be fat, I wouldn\u2019t be fat.In other words, I\u2019m asking for it.I\u2019m asking for all of the snide comments, when I sit on a bus or some other kind of public transportation, especially when the only open seat is the 3\/4ths of one that is only barely covered by my ass.I\u2019m asking for it, when people give me dirty looks when I have to stop walking \u2014 wherever I\u2019m walking \u2014 and catch my breath for a second.I\u2019m asking for it whenever some little kid points at me, when I\u2019m sitting alone at a diner, eating a meal and reading my book.I\u2019m asking for it, because if I could put down the goddamn doughnuts and pick up a salad for once in my life, I would look just like the rest of you. I would be skinny. Or, at least, I would be less fat.I could give you some sob story, about how I\u2019ve been overweight ever since I was a year old, and by the time I could be considered reasonably old enough to learn to control my diet, my body was already a runaway train.I could talk to you about poverty, about how being poor means less access to fresh fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods; how the cheapest foods out there are pumped full of HFCS, giving them a higher calorie-per-dollar ratio.I could talk to you about genetics, about how weight tends to run in families, and how I inherited the Orlando Thunder-Thighs from my father\u2019s mother\u2019s mother and her kin.I could talk to you about Major Depression, suicidal ideation, and Binge-Eating Disorder (which actually is a real goddamn thing, even if it hasn\u2019t been in the DSM as long as some other conditions).I could bring up all of those things, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.You would think I was just making excuses. And I might actually agree with that. But also, I shouldn\u2019t have to justify myself.Even if I am as large as three of you put together.Even if I do sometimes need a cane, or oxygen, or to stop and catch my breath for a second.Even if I can\u2019t do a mile in 7 minutes or 17 minutes or 27 minutes.Even if there are times \u2014 multiple times \u2014 where I\u2019ve sought comfort in food. And not just food, but in the worst food: in a pint of Ben & Jerry\u2019s, or a bulk bag of M&Ms, or in a dozen doughnuts.Even if every single message that we get from our health-obsessed, beauty-obsessed culture tells you that I\u2019m a gigantic, lazy, worthless waste of space.I am trying to get healthy.I am trying to survive in this world, one day at a time.I am not much different than you.Sign up for updates and new posts.Written byWritten by","16032":"In the Nath Tradition the human body called vyashti-pinda or prakriti-pinda.

It\u2019s like a system consists of many different parts all of which are important and connected to each other. The human body as individual body is described by Gorakshanath as a pinda consisting of various parts:So as we can see our body \u2014 vyashti-pinda \u2014 is a very complicated system, more then only the physical body with mind, that fully reflects the Cosmic System (or Cosmic Body). And in my opinion in the process of yoga-sadhana we should consider the influence of it on all these aspects of the vyashti-pinda, gradually realizing the identity of it with a Cosmic Body (also called the samashti-pinda).Written byWritten by","16051":"Living the examined life is not so easy. To be an original, to create a life of your own design, to parse, weight and scale where and how you can best contribute is not so easy. To write your own marching orders, to look and ponder, to surmise and re-evaluate is not so easy. Whether you\u2019ve always had in mind this intention \u2014 and even see it as an obligation or, startled, realized that too much of your life \u201cjust happened,\u201d there\u2019s much to think about, plan for and do.Think about it. When you choose to create a life of your own design, you must accommodate all those commitments already undertaken. There\u2019s the normal pressure of what\u2019s expected of you, of course, the standard exterior clash of wills with those who have claims upon you or those upon whom you make claim. What do you owe those who contribute to your support? And what do you owe those who depend on you? And then there are, of course, the ever-vigilant conventions and rules that apply to you and everyone else, no matter what.But you must also come to grips with all the conflicting data that surrounds the examined life. How do you honestly know your own mind and the calls upon it? Can it really \u201cstand back\u201d and examine itself?Part of the problem is that we see things as WE are, not as THEY are.This recognition is key to success with creating a life of our own design. Why? Because the ability to envision, evaluate, assess, project and correct, etc., is remarkably and extensively determined by our subjectivity. Let me tell you what I mean.Are our eyes impartial? No. And we don\u2019t sense sound and taste, for example, with impartial ears and tongues. Are our minds impartial? No. We don\u2019t sense phenomena objectively. Sensing is a feature of our subjectivity, not an objective process.Our grasp of what\u2019s going on is a comprehension based chiefly on the automatic, reflexive grab of biology, education, conditioning, experience, unfriendly or friendly persuasion and the intoxicating mickeys life slips us. We were inserted, fitted, hammered and seduced into the mix of things that exist interior or exterior to us. And this comprehension becomes a significant piece of the mind\u2019s \u201cI\u201d with which we interpret and engage life.Parents do their best to shape their children in a particular, thoughtful way, as do schools. Amid this careful rearing and schooling, however, something else equally impressive and equally influential is going on. Children\u2019s senses \u2014 their eyes, ears, bodies and minds \u2014 are also connecting to, for instance, color, sound, vibe, heft, authority and countless other phenomena that also knuckle-mold their \u201ctake\u201d on life.In virtually every social situation, young children have a feeling for who has the power, who rewards and punishes, who and what should be avoided, as well as for what is of value, what is esteemed and what they say, in effect, sucks.Also, on much of the turf where they observe, play and interact, children sense that it is a mistake to appear clueless, unknowing, curious or unsure. Inadvertently, involuntarily and uncontrollably, then, a reckless (or anxious) certainty and hard-to-deal-with willful cockiness may replace the inquiring mind. We could say that youngsters, by virtue of what they have sensed, already have a point of view about life or a mindset though they would not be able to articulate it as such.By the time that significant choices need to be made, this is the subjectively owned furniture occupying the mind of children turning into teens and teens turning into adults. The old furniture stays put unless the pieces are consistently upgraded by, for example, the conscientious acquisition and virtuous practice of wisdom and judgment.Won\u2019t everyday life be much better lived if you just put your mind to a little remodeling and upgrading of its furniture?Yet, in part because of this inadvertent closing of the mind, most of this furniture remains unexamined, untested, unevaluated. We tend to put more attention on trying to get what we\u2019re supposed to want than on creating a life of our own design.Nonetheless, we don\u2019t have to surrender to the way that we have always been or to the first wave of habituated responses. Each of us has the ability to be an original, to stamp our own will on our condition and circumstance.And this need to examine and perfect who we are, to see a bigger picture, be a bigger person and make a bigger contribution is a predicament that virtually every one of us faces. If the truth be told, our shot at living a meaningful life, that is, exercising our freedom, creativity and originality within the experimental framework of America\u2019s vision of individual freedom, is usually directly correlated to our philosophy and skill with the competent practice of autonomy. This has everything to do with the perspective we have and the substance we have. Without such skill, our experience is often one of agitation, awkwardness and uncertainty. Worse, we look for relief from this instability and misfit in the reflexive familiarity of our biological immediacy and conditioned mindset, neither of which we thoughtfully authored or govern.But as we begin to exercise our freedom to mediate this subjectivity, exciting new possibilities for intellectual happiness and for life and lifestyle emerge. This is what comes of taking a fresh look at the subjective manner in which we recognize ourselves, our resources (including our minds) and our moral, civil and rational character or identity.As it turns out, our choices \u2014 what we attend to and what we care about \u2014 reflect the extent to which we have taken responsibility for our autonomy and life.When we take up the opportunity and challenge of our autonomy, indeed, when we see a bigger picture, we are bigger persons in the sense that the furniture of the mind, once cluttered, cobwebbed and unmovable, becomes amenable to design and purposeful arrangement. As a result of our focused effort to live an examined life, we can expect to enjoy both a new spontaneity and a range of emotional control that better match the demands of the complex and uncertain world in which we live.I\u2019ve been teaching classes on autonomy and life for over 30 years. This coursework offers a philosophic perspective, vocabulary and strategies for acquiring a life of our own design. As an American Philosopher, this work stands firmly on America\u2019s promise of freedom, justice and equality and the opportunity for not just living our life but for owning our life.

You might think of me as the Forrest Gump of my generation. For my patients, I recommend aiming for a minimum of 7200 steps daily. Even thirty minutes of walking briskly may lower your risk of a myriad of maladies, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. But what about running? Here is the recently published conclusion of investigators looking at a broad swath of the available evidence:Any amount of running is linked to a significantly lower risk of death from any cause, finds a pooled analysis of the available evidence, published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.We begin with the rationale for considering running. First, we know that we can potentially lead to substantial improvements in population health and length of life. Still, it is not well-understood how well running is for avoiding premature death from any cause, and in particular from cardiovascular disease or cancer. We also don\u2019t have a great sense of the volume (including the frequency, duration, and pace) of running sufficient to improve health.In an effort to answer these questions, investigators systematically reviewed the available clinical research, including conference presentations, doctoral dissertations, and published research. The study authors identified fourteen appropriate research studies, ones which involved over two hundred and thirty-two thousand people. These subjects had been tracked for between 5.5 and thirty-five years. Here are the provocative findings, after researchers pooled the study data:Any amount of running was associated with a twenty-seven percent lower risk of death from all causes for both men and women, compared with no running. Running was also linked with a thirty percent relative reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and a twenty-three percent (or a drop by about a quarter) lower risk of death from cancer.Even small \u2018doses\u2019 \u2014 for example, once weekly or less, lasting less than 50 minutes each time, and at a speed below 6 miles (8 km) an hour, still seemed to be associated with significant health\/longevity benefits.So running for 25 minutes less than the recommended weekly duration of vigorous physical activity could reduce the risk of death. This makes running a potentially good option for those whose main obstacle to doing enough exercise is lack of time, suggest the researchers.But upping \u2018the dose\u2019 wasn\u2019t associated with a further lowering of the risk of death from any cause, the analysis showed.This is an observational study, and as such, can\u2019t establish cause. And the researchers caution that the number of included studies was small and their methods varied considerably, which may have influenced the results.Nevertheless, they suggest that any amount of running is better than none, concluding: \u201cIncreased rates of participation in running, regardless of its dose, would probably lead to substantial improvements in population health and longevity.\u201dMy take is that regular exercise clearly is associated with a myriad of health benefits. Indeed, a sedentary lifestyle may be an even stronger predictor of mortality than risk factors that quickly come to mind, including smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes. This is the shocking conclusion of the American Heart Association, as published in 2016 in the journal Circulation.For my patients who are able, I like to prescribe an exercise program. The components typically include exercises that improve aerobic fitness, strength, mobility, and balance. Aerobic exercise is a broad term, and includes anything that promotes heart and lung fitness. Strength exercises can mean resistance training or strength training. Think push-ups, free weights, resistance bands or machines that place loads on your muscles.Mobility exercises are often forgotten, especially among older adults. Aim for maintenance of a healthy range of motion, including of the shoulders, spine, and hips. I don\u2019t include time spent doing isolated flexibility exercises towards our weekly goal of one hundred and fifty minutes of exercise.Finally, I would be remiss to not remind you to warm up and to cool down. As I age, I am discovering the importance of doing a planned activity at an initial lower intensity and speed. As well, a good cool down can aid in recovery, and drop our risk of collapse!As for me, I am off for a thirty minute brisk walk over the lunch hour. The weather in Seattle this week has been glorious! I hope you too are having a joy-filled week.Written byWritten by","16231":"Last year, I challenged myself and those around me to completely disable notifications on our mobile devices. It was an effort to become more present and focused, and it was successful: what began as a source of anxiety and constant distraction became an opportunity for productivity. I suddenly found myself able to get so much more done, in less time.And removing notifications was just the first step in my quest to be more present. I\u2019ve since found that limiting my overall mobile usage has led to some seriously positive results. Inspired by my friend Justin Kan, I switched my phone to greyscale mode and deleted nearly all my apps. Now, I am no longer tethered to my phone. When I want to get some work done, I have to sit down at my computer to do it.

When I\u2019m waiting for my order in a cafe, I let my mind wander and think creatively rather than mindlessly scroll through social media.So, I\u2019m trying a new experiment with my employees at Front: I\u2019m challenging my team to use their phones less. To be specific, I\u2019m challenging them to reduce their weekly screen time to 14 hours per week (which is 8 hours less than the average of 22 hours per week). If they meet this weekly challenge for a full month, they will receive $100 they can use towards gym memberships, fitness classes, therapy sessions, massages, or anything meant to improve their physical or mental health. How they reduce their screen time is completely up to them, but we\u2019ve created some resources to help guide them along the way.The ultimate goal of this challenge is to help my team and encourage others to develop more thoughtful, efficient relationships with our mobile devices. I believe that doing so allows us to be more productive, think more clearly, and be happier. The mission of Front is to Work Happier, and I would do anything I could to help make that a reality for our team. This challenge is one way I can do that, and I believe those who participate will come away from this with a few really great benefits.A few of those include:My goal with this challenge is to help my team enjoy these benefits and I encourage you to join us.

In high school, Harrington was a 5-foot-8, 132 pounder. He didn\u2019t play any sports, other than golf. \u201cI never competed in anything in my life,\u201d he says.When he retired and moved to Arizona in 2007 from the Chicago area, he wasn\u2019t any taller, but he was 50 pounds heavier. It was time to get back in shape, he decided. At 69, he hired a personal trainer, with a goal of improving his golf game. He worked at it for several years.\u201cI didn\u2019t get any better at golf, but it got me into the gym,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s changed my life.\u201dHarrington turned 81 on Oct. 3. He recently set what he believes to be a world record for planking by the 80-plus set: 10 minutes. The closest claim he\u2019s found is another octogenarian on YouTube who flamed out at 8 minutes. (If you\u2019ve never planked, no matter your age, just try to do 1 minute horizontal on your toes and elbows.)Meanwhile, Harrington is still fuming about losing his Arizona age-group records in powerlifting to an 84-year-old upstart from Sedona, in USA Powerflifting\u2019s Southwest regional competition in August. Harrington won the state championship in April (he was unopposed, he admits \u2014 nationwide, there are only a half-dozen powerlifters in his age group). Before his August loss, he had held state records of 132 pounds in the squat, 116 in bench press, and 237 in the deadlift.He promised his newfound nemesis he\u2019ll be back. \u201cWhen I grow up, I told him, when I\u2019m 84, I\u2019m going to beat you.\u201dHere\u2019s how Mike Harrington went from an average Joe to muscleman Mike.One day, while gambling in Laughlin, Nev., \u201cI ran out of money, and I was looking for something to do,\u201d he says. He saw a sign for a powerlifting competition at Harrah\u2019s, so he headed over. Nobody his age \u2014 77 at the time \u2014 was competing, but there were some guys in their 60s, \u201cand I thought, shoot, I can do this.\u201dFour years ago this month, he hooked up with Chris Treanor, co-owner of Crossfit Blade in North Phoenix. Treanor helped him develop a workout regime geared for powerlifting, and had him cut back on milk, desserts and other sources of sugar, and add protein to fuel his building muscles. Over time, Harrington got stronger while dropping 20 pounds to his current weight of 162.On Jan. 1 this year, Harrington set his sights on planking, something he\u2019d never done before.Planks are known for working the entire body, and especially core back and abdominal muscles. \u201cPlank exercises recruit a better balance of muscles on the front, sides, and back of the body during exercise than do sit-ups, which target just a few muscles,\u201d according to Harvard Medical School\u2019s Healthbeat. The Mayo Clinic includes planking on a list of 13 exercises that strengthen the core, important because: \u201cStrong core muscles make it easier to do many physical activities.\u201d\u201cThe first day I did 34 seconds,\u201d Harriman says.He practiced five days a week for two months, getting his time up to a 6-minute continuous plank. Then with the help of his trainer, he cut back to three days a week and started doing sets of varying time, like 6 minutes, then 5, then 4, down to 1, with a 1-minute rest between each repetition. In July \u2014 with plenty of groaning \u2014 he hit the 10-minute mark:Multiple studies have shown that physical activity of any sort \u2014 from brief weightlifting sessions to climbing stairs or just going for a stroll \u2014offer a host of benefits, from improved sleep to better overall physical and mental well-being. Research also shows there are benefits to be found regardless of age, so it\u2019s never too late to start.Harrington says it\u2019s not about which exercise or what sport you choose so much as having a goal\u2014perhaps choosing an activity you\u2019ve never done before. He acknowledges he won\u2019t shoot in the 70s in golf again, like he did as a teenager, but he knows he can do an even longer plank. In training the day before his 81st birthday, he hit a new level in his plank training, with four reps\u20148 minutes, 6 minutes, 4 then 2, with a 1-minute break between each. Meanwhile, he\u2019s waiting on the folks at Guinness World Records to get back to him on whether a category for his age exists.\u201cIf there\u2019s a record, I\u2019ll break it,\u201d he says. \u201cIf there\u2019s no record, I\u2019ll set one \u2014 aim for 11 or 12 minutes, maybe 13.\u201dHarrington offers this advice to any senior who thinks it\u2019s too late to start exercising, or who fears working out will be too hard during their remaining years: \u201cHow do you want to spend that time? Do you want to be able to get up off the couch, or do you want to get up and fall down? It\u2019s the quality of life. If you want a sedentary life, you\u2019ll die sitting on the friggin\u2019 couch. I\u2019d rather die in the mountains or out in the desert.\u201dOr at the gym.Adapted from an article first published on North Phoenix News.Exploring the human condition and ways to improve it.\u00a0Take a lookWritten byWritten by","16341":"Trying to change my eating habits over the last few months has been an exercise in struggle.Unfortunately, without much exercise. But the thinking is, when I lose enough weight for that to not be painful, that\u2019ll come along too. But, anyway.It almost seems like a bad joke that a fat person who spends a lot of time on the computer is going to have one hand on the keyboard, and one hand rooting around in a half-empty bag of Cheeto dust. Almost like a perpetual motion machine, with one hand doing the shoveling and the other hand doing the typing.Yeah, I have a lot of internalized fatphobia. But in my case, that isn\u2019t quite so distant from the truth.I\u2019ve always been an escapist. Or, perhaps, it\u2019s more accurate to say, I\u2019ve always been trying to escape from this body. Whether through books, through video games, through acting on stage, through binge-watching television, or through writing stories.It doesn\u2019t really matter too much what I\u2019m doing. As long as my brain is engaged, and I\u2019m not making my body hurt too much. I can pretend the body isn\u2019t even there.I don\u2019t know how snacking while escaping became a part of the ritual. But, now, nearly three decades in, all I can say, is that it is. It\u2019s become a completely passive thing, almost completely mindless.So, when you take it away? It becomes completely noticeable. Like a missing front tooth!(Hey, I have one of those, too! It\u2019s really noticeable. And I really miss corn on the cob.)It\u2019s not like I\u2019m constantly eating in a literal sense, or anything. But I am used to being full. To getting up a few times between meals to scouring out something to eat. To not limiting what I can eat. To always having a box of crackers or some other snacky food nearby.And, when they\u2019re not nearby, my mind snaps back into my body. Usually with the thought: I\u2019m hungry.I am, of course, not hungry. At least, not in any kind of literal sense.Right now, I\u2019m on a diet of two protein shakes a day, with two small non-carby snacks, and one full, if carbless dinner.There is absolutely no risk of me going hungry in any sense of the word. But I\u2019m not as full as I\u2019ve become used to being, either. And it kind of breaks the zen, or whatever you want to call it, that lets me travel out of my body and into whatever creative world I want to, for long periods at a time.No, I am firmly here, in the real world. Usually listening to the two senior citizens in the house who are snacking on jelly beans and cookies and cakes and Ritz and Doritos. Who have gone most of their lives without eating a vegetable (other than corn, which is actually a grain\/carb!) or counting a calorie. Who are, somehow, a fraction of the size I am.Okay, I\u2019m not going to pick on the skinny old people. But still. Two or three times a day, Carole will go through her stash (the cabinet is in the back of my office area) and loudly exclaim \u201clook at all this stuff Kevin got for us! He got us the cakes and cookies we like, and my Doritos!\u201dAnd on one hand, I just turn back to the computer and keep working, but on the other hand, I just want to open up my lungs and inhale. . . all of the cookies, all of the crackers, all of the cake, and all of the snacks in a twenty mile radius.Okay, not really. But still. I bite my tongue and I keep going.I know that, ultimately, that\u2019s the only way I\u2019m going to be able to deal with this shit. I\u2019m going to have to get used to being \u201chungry\u201d \u2014 that is, at least, not always stuffed full.Maybe drinking more water, even though that means I\u2019m going to piss like a racehorse. It at least creates the illusion of being full.I\u2019m going to have to learn how to push myself back out into that usual out-of-body zone so I could get my work done. (Writing a Medium article usually takes 30 minutes to an hour. As I type this, I\u2019m going on hour three of working on this post.)Creative work is hard when every little creak snaps you back into your body, just long enough to think Wow, I\u2019m hungry!Even when you\u2019re not, technically.This is a thing that\u2019s going to take time and work. I\u2019m not fond of those things. In The Return of The King, The Mouth of Sauron mocks Gandalf. \u201cYou crave surety. Sauron gives none.\u201dI crave surety, too. I\u2019d like to know that the shit I go through now will pay off. That my current work and discomfort and grief will end up being worth something.It\u2019s hard to accept that there are no guarantees. Just more struggle.I\u2019ve just got to stay here and keep working at it.Sign up for more: thefatrando.comWritten byWritten by","16356":"I went out for dinner last night.It was a birthday celebration with a long group of friends \u2014 we took up the largest table in the joint. For some reason, the place struck me as the kind of place that you\u2019d see in a Stephen King novel. It was kind of dark and dingy, the kind of place that was probably filled with smoke two decades ago. It\u2019s like you can practically see the cigarettes that are supposed to be in the hands of the old men sitting at the counter, but now the waitresses say \u201cSorry, sugar, you got to take that outside now.\u201dGod damn those newfangled health laws, right?Okay, I digress. But only a little. It\u2019s just to say that our large and (somewhat) noisy group stood out in this place.Or maybe it was just me that was noticeable. At 480ish pounds, I tend to have that effect. But I took a seat at the end of the table, my usual position so I don\u2019t have to try to squeeze in between people. It\u2019s easier and more comfortable, especially with my current leg injury, which I had wrapped from ankle to knee in gauze.I had just finished my salad when the man came over.He had been sitting in one of the nearby booths, eating dinner with a woman that was probably his wife. He had made a little bit of small talk with us across the room, talking about the weather.This was nice, if strange. As a LA-area transplant in Pennsylvania, I\u2019m still kind of often surprised by the casual friendliness of people. Their willingness to strike up a conversation with anyone, anywhere. While Angelenos are slightly more laid back than New Yorkers, we aren\u2019t usually bubbling with polite conversation like this. We keep ourselves to ourselves.But I managed to smile and chat for a few minutes. Relatively painless. And then we both went back to conversations at our own tables.But then he came over.The man asked what had happened to my leg. I was kind of surprised by the direct, personal question, but what the hell. It\u2019s not like I had injured my leg while on some top-secret mission, so I told him that it was a skin infection.And then he offered to pray for me.I didn\u2019t know what to do with that. I mean, me and the Old Fart upstairs still have some issues to work out, especially with those children of his who like to preach Prosperity Gospel and torture Queer kids.So I had to figure, what is the least awkward way to get out of this?I let him pray over me.It was a nice prayer, short and to the point. He put his hand on my shoulder. He didn\u2019t damn me or my wonky leg to hellfire, or anything like that. It wasn\u2019t anything that would have been out of place in the Southern Baptist church that I spent my teenage years in.And, for all I know, it could be. That\u2019s the kicker of this whole situation.It could very well be that this nice, gentle-hearted Christian man saw a stranger that was in pain, and decided to offer some kindness and comfort the only way that he knew how, by offering a prayer.But when you are a fat person in this world, kindness is usually weaponized against you. People become \u201cconcerned\u201d about you. About your \u201chealth\u201d, about your \u201cwellness\u201d.I\u2019ll never forget the one morning when, after getting off of my grave shift, I decided to have breakfast at Denny\u2019s. I was sitting at my table, Diet Coke in hand, a copy of Laurie Halse Anderson\u2019s Speak in the other. Clearly someone who was asking for a conversation. A random woman came up to me and asked, hands on her hips, \u201cShould you be drinking soda this early?\u201dLike she was my dietitian. Or my mother.I wish I had some witty comeback. Instead, I took another sip and kept reading.But that was only the most explicit manifestation of somebody\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d. Sometimes it shows up as \u201cadvice\u201d: the different diets you should try, different workout regimens, different medications or supplements that you totally need to give a shot.After all, it worked for their second great-cousin\u2019s auntie\u2019s best friend\u2019s fat neighbor. So it should work for me, too.The sad thing is, it makes you suspicious of anybody\u2019s kindness. You live with this happening to you long enough, and you start trying to read the double meaning into any complement, any positive or complimentary thing that anyone says.You start looking for the hidden insult. And there usually is one.It seems that this time, there wasn\u2019t. But who knows?I can\u2019t help but wonder: would this guy have noticed a skinny guy, a normal-sized guy with a wrapped leg? Or would his eyes have just glossed over him, the same way they did everyone else at my table?That\u2019s the million-dollar question for me: is there a size that I can get to where I just blend into the scenery? A size where it\u2019s okay for me to go out to dinner, without people voicing their concern \u2014 either genuine or not?I don\u2019t know.As we were leaving, I saw my new friend outside, smoking a cigarette. I offered up a small and silent prayer for his lungs.Sign up for more: thatfatrando.comWritten byWritten by","16430":"I am not a morning person. Not in the least.To be fair, it\u2019s not like I really have any kind of organized sleep schedule. One of the perks (and problems) of working from home is that I don\u2019t usually have any specific time that I have to be awake, unless something unusual is happening. And, considering that I schedule most of my appointments for the afternoon, it is rare that I will choose to get up before 11 AM or so.Of course, with my depression and health issues, my sleeping is much more chaotic than that. When my anxiety is racing faster than my brain, I can climb into bed at a normal, decent bedtime (say, 1 AM) and not fall asleep until 10 AM.My sleep schedule is all kinds of jacked up, especially on the days when I sleep for 12\u201315 hours. But I digress.This morning, to help out with some household stuff, I set my alarm for 5:55 AM. Because God is a sadist, I woke up at 5:50 AM.One of the things that Influencer type people, especially here on Medium, will try to sell you, is that there\u2019s something magical about waking up so early in the morning \u2014 or even earlier. In fact, I\u2019m sure there are some people who are scandalized and outraged that I think waking up at 5:50 is so outrageous. They\u2019re already 2 hours into work by that time!Apparently, this works for some people. One of my old running jokes is that I know it\u2019s time for bed when I see one of my favorite authors, Laurie Halse Anderson, post her good morning messages on social media. Laurie is an early riser. I am not.Some people would argue here that I would do well to emulate Laurie, especially considering that she\u2019s the person who made me become an author, and I should be trying to emulate her.Laurie never suggests this, of course. Laurie is a good person. I bid her a good morning, she bids me a good night.If I thought that waking up at 5 AM would make me a NYT Bestselling Author, I probably would get up that early. But I have a feeling that it would only result in me being a cranky asshole, and tired, to boot.Though I will admit, there is a piece of me that wishes I was more productive. I wish I had one of those Instagram worthy 5 AM lives. I just don\u2019t wish for it bad enough to be in bed by 10 PM every night.But today, I got up early. And I was excited to, if only for the change of pace.Part of me wondered if I would end up being more productive. Of course, my plans weren\u2019t entirely too productive. Get online, start doing some of my work (checking the various Ninja Writer groups and accounts), and maybe even get some work done.Of course, I also brought my Switch downstairs. A much less admirable half of my brain was planning on playing some Pokemon and watching some more Hell\u2019s Kitchen (Amazon Prime members can watch all 17 seasons for free \u2014 and I have a cousin (second cousin? cousin twice-removed?) who is in several of those seasons, for an average of 10 seconds each episode \u2014 Hey, there\u2019s Andi!)My brain cooperated somewhat \u2014 it struck a happy average of checking my social media before jumping immediately into Christmas shopping. Which is something that needed to happen.And now, I get something new to worry about. I ordered somebody a gift that I didn\u2019t realize would ship from New Zealand until I\u2019d already ordered it. Will it arrive in time? God only knows.But I think waking up this morning turned out well \u2014 hell, it\u2019s 9:30 AM and I\u2019m already well into today\u2019s Medium post. Usually, I\u2019m rushing to get it out before 8:30 or 9:00 PM, by which point it\u2019s pretty clear that no one will see it for the day.So I\u2019ve accomplished a lot this morning. But am I willing to make it a habit? Am I willing to let the techbros with all of their bullshit productivity posts win?I don\u2019t know. I really like my sleep.But, I have to admit that there are some things that you miss out on when you sleep for half the day. And not just Vitamin D, which is already so rare, here in the middle of the Pennsylvania forest where it\u2019s currently getting dark around 4:30 in the afternoon. There\u2019s also the sense of being a part of the normal, productive world.Maybe that alone is worth getting up at an early hour, even if not an ungodly hour. Maybe 8:00?I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m willing to try, but my brain is certainly playing around with the idea.Written byWritten by","16468":"The roles of legumes in health health.A recent analysis of a collection of studies, or meta-analysis focuses on the potential role in promoting heart health. Publishing in Advances in Nutrition, Effie Viguiliouk and colleagues provide some insights regarding the relationship of legume consumption and health.We begin with the premise that diet\/nutrition play a central role in our health. You already know the basics: A diet high in sugar, salt, and fat increases the probability of a myriad of maladies, from obesity to premature death. And we know that eating a balanced diet that is rich in fresh fruits and vegetables appears to reduce the probability of several health problems.LegumesDietary pulses, the edible dried seeds of legumes (that is, chickpeas, lentils, beans, and peas) that are high in fiber, plant protein, and various micronutrients and low in fat and glycemic index (GI) have been increasingly recognized for their benefits in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) across various chronic disease guidelines.The American Heart Association, Canadian Cardiovascular Society, and European Society for Cardiology all encourage dietary patterns that emphasize intake of legumes (which include dietary pulses, soybeans, peanuts, fresh peas, and fresh beans) for lowering \u201cbad\u201d LDL cholesterol and blood pressure, dietary pulses for lowering LDL cholesterol, and legumes for lowering LDL cholesterol and improving the overall lipoprotein profile, respectively.Still, historically we have had challenges telling you exactly what specific foods have a given effect on particular diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. Researchers performing the recent meta-analysis offer some insights, with their goal being a better understanding of how legumes affect heart health. More specifically, they trained their eyes on cardiovascular disease (think heart attack, stroke, and coronary heart disease) risk, as well as mortality related to same. They also investigated the relationship of legumes and other diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), and obesity. Here is what they found:The team identified a positive relationship between consuming higher quantities of legumes and a reduced risk of certain cardiovascular parameters. [Still, they offer that] the overall certainty of the evidence was graded as \u201clow\u201d for cardiovascular disease incidence and \u201cvery low\u201d for all other outcomes.The study authors also remind us of the phenomenon of confounding. For example, a healthy eater may have other health-promoting activities (such as regularly exercising). Another potential problem centers on the self-reporting of food intake. Some believe that self-reporting is so unreliable that it should be barred from scientific research.The researchers endeavored to reduce the influence of such factors, by performing a meta-analysis. Still, this is an imperfect approach to eliminating residual confounding, a problem with all observational studies.Despite all of this, the investigators leave us this message:Americans eat less than one serving of legumes per day, on average. Simply adding more beans to our plates could be a powerful tool in fighting heart disease and bringing down blood pressure. The context? In the United States, one in four deaths relate to cardiovascular disease. Even if we only effect a small change in risk among the population, there might be a significant effect at the population level.Written byWritten by","16525":"I scroll through Linkedin, past the posts of self-promotion that end with a sales pitch, or plagiarized quotes shared without credit to they who spoke or wrote it, and through a forest of promoted pages, to find a Boston based company welcoming a new class of employees. A symbol of growth. Congrats.There\u2019s a photo. It\u2019s of their employee\u2019s new workstations. Here, they find a branded reusable water bottle, Chromebook, T-shirt, and their name spelled in Starbursts. Flavors distributed evenly, the shortest name using 47 individually wrapped candies. They\u2019ll then accept the recurring invite set for Thursday at 4 pm titled \u201cHappy Hour\u201d, and mark as read an email reminding all employees that on Friday there will be baked goods in honor of a marketing manager\u2019s final day.Offline, it keeps going. At 10 am they\u2019ll be introduced to the company, awkwardly high fiving all 137 employees en route to the gong, \u201cThat\u2019s the only free gong you\u2019ll get!\u201d yells an overexcited Account Executive who laughs hardest at his own\u2026jokes?And by noon, they\u2019ll have keycards that grant them access to the building, which will come in handy when they return from lunch with their team.For a moment, I drank the kool-aid.Being self-employed, I was swept up in the excitement of having teammates, being gifted a new laptop, and the thought of direct deposit or opting into a company health insurance package.But only for a moment.Did I really want to join a company whose first impression was to welcome me with my name spelled out in Starbursts (My name is longer than John and would need at least 60), invite me to a drinking affair, and remind me I\u2019ll be able to skip breakfast Friday and sample sweets all day?Now, Starbursts aren\u2019t the enemy and, aside from the sheer lack of originality of the desk spread, I understand their intended use was to welcome a new teammate with something cute and familiar. But, having dove deep enough into health and wellness these past few years, that is not a strong enough justification for putting 129 grams of sugar on a person\u2019s desk. We know better.Or we should know better.We should know better because of the science available. We should know that sugar is actively harmful to humans. Just look at these ingredients: Corn Syrup, Sugar, Hydrogenated Palm Kernel Oil, Fruit Juice from Concentrate, Less than 2% Citric Acid, Tapioca Dextrin, Gelatin, Modified Corn Starch, Natural and Artificial Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Coloring.It\u2019s everything we know to stay away from.Each time we make a purchase, we are voting for something. So, we should know that spending company money to provide sugar in such large quantities is the equivalent to gifting obesity and cardiovascular disease, or at least stating we support the pursuit of these diseases through poor dietary choices.The company that welcomes employees with a gift of 129 grams of sugar is not evil. What this company has done though, is leave the door open just wide enough for a larger conversation to be had.A conversation that sheds light on the truth that our workplaces are not that healthy and advertised corporate wellness programs lack depth and accountability despite being used to impress candidates during an interview or search process.For this conversation, we must first assign an updated definition to health and wellness. Health is defined as the overall mental and physical state of a person; the absence of disease. Wellness refers to the state of being in optimal mental and physical health. I accept this, but optimal mental and physical health is a state of being, and these definitions fail to include actions that can deliver a person to this state.Health and wellness is what you eat, how you move your body, how you sleep, how you manage stress, how you speak to yourself, how you speak to others, how you create community, and how you love.Health and wellness is as much a practice, as it is a report card.Over the past 2 decades, what I call \u201cwallpaper\u201d perks have popped up under the benefits section of job descriptions. They are appealing, but a bit deceptive. First, it was ping-pong, then it was beer on tap in the office, now it\u2019s corporate wellness. Interview at almost any Tech company and they\u2019ll tell you about their wellness program. You\u2019ll learn this may be a gym subsidy, $25 per month for riding your bike to work (I do love this one), quarterly yoga in the office, or even Sam\u2019s 10k Step Challenge every February.\u201cWow, how the fuck do I get a job here\u201d the candidate is supposed to reply.Shut up, candidate. This is an insult.For a company to pride themselves on having flexible schedules, work-life balance, and a robust corporate wellness program, only to then populate office kitchens with high-sodium, high sugar, processed foods, and 24\/7 access to beer taps is deceptive and wrong.The actions don\u2019t match the advertisement.To use wellness as a recruitment tool, without the intention or ability to offer a complete program is short-sighted and unfair. It\u2019s a tactic that will decrease retention and expresses that leadership doesn\u2019t care really care about their employees.With poor diet being the second leading preventable cause of death in the United States, behind Tobacco, it\u2019s time to move to the three-position:AlcoholThe use of alcohol as bait for new candidates and a team-building activities is tragic.I should end this piece here because a sensible person in a position of power would immediately address their company culture and issue new policies to address the health and wellness of their employees, BUT, I am having fun so let\u2019s continue.Not only is alcohol dangerous and addictive, but it is packaged with an economic burden (I bet your CFO is thrilled that you encourage this weekly consumption!) through direct purchase and when considering performances relationship to alcohol.Or dare I continue and discuss anxiety\u2019s relationship with alcohol, or sleep\u2019s relationship with alcohol.You cannot control how someone behaves or reacts to alcohol, but by asking them to stop their productive workday at 4 pm on a Thursday and drink alcohol you\u2019re doing your best to find out.The provision of alcohol does not strengthen company culture, it enables potential destructive behavior and habits. Consider what happens when an employee leaves work, inhibitions lowered, or even the next day when nursing a hangover, taking extended coffee breaks until lunch, which we know won\u2019t be of ideal nutrition, but no worries because we have an abundance of baked sweets in the kitchen to fill us up. Enjoy your direct-deposit with an end of week spiral! Sigh.Bringing people together for team-building is critical to the success of an organization. Using alcohol to excite team members alienates those that choose not to drink, promotes controversial values, and quite frankly lacks creativity. The weekly happy hour, in fact, encourages a loss of production and spoon-feeds employees a beverage that 4% of the US population is addicted to and over 30% misuses on a regular basis.\u201cWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.\u201d \u2014 Mark TwainIf alcohol is the only way you bring your team together then you have significant identity issues. Ones, that band-aid beer bottles can\u2019t fix. The challenge is to create team-building and bonding exercises that EVERY OTHER COMPANY doesn\u2019t do, and truly invest in your team.Now, at this point, you may want to trip the high horse that I am riding on, especially if you\u2019re in Talent Acquisition or have an HR function, but I feel I\u2019ve earned this stage. I worked in the recruiting space, I am sober for 2 years, and I am in the depths of sugar addiction. I have no talking points about equity, incentives, accelerators, or company cards, I only have them for things I am qualified to speak to.Qualified, because what I do know is is that stocking an office with addictive substances is wrong. Alcohol and sugar are addictive. And before you argue \u201cIt\u2019s my body, I control what I put in it\u201d or advocate for personal responsibility, understand that, traits of addictions aside, for a company to spend their money to supply these goods, and then require an individual to be in the presence of these goods for 40+ hours per week, is actively voting against their employee\u2019s personal wellness. Nevermind the creation of an arena to directly challenge those who have chosen sobriety or pursue healthy eating patterns.This is why companies must confront their \u201cWellness Programs\u201d and determine whether or not they have a complete program, or are willing to invest in one.But What Should Corporate Wellness Look Like?A complete corporate wellness program addresses all aspects of an employee\u2019s health and wellness.A company does not need to institute a complete ban on certain food and beverages, but they should not spend money on high sugar, high sodium, processed foods or alcohol. If employees want to spend their money on these items, they are welcome to, but a company can not be bringing these into their workplace and offering them.\u201cLet food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food\u201d \u2014 HippocratesWe\u2019ve known for thousands of years the power of food.With a rise in Millenials in the workforce and a decline in Millenial's health, leading them to be the least healthy generation, employers no longer can reject science that proves plant-based nutrition programs in a workplace setting significantly improve depression, anxiety, and productivity, when ordering team lunches or stocking shelves. At the very least, employers must begin to introduce policies that suggest better consumption if they want to be considered to have a complete corporate wellness program.Companies must encourage movements with a low barrier to entry. By introducing an inclusive benchmark, it is more inviting to employees and more sustainable. This can take the shape of monthly step challenges (but please have a great reward), natural commuter subsidies (bike, walk, run), or really embrace this and pursue relationships with local studios where your employees will receive a significant discount.Companies can also create a group in a platform like Strava, a social fitness network, which allows cross profile engagement in and out of the office, or host a Slack channel for #NaturalMovement #Running or #AfternoonWalks. These are small introductions that leverage team accountability \u2014 If you see teammates 1\u20135 having fun on a run, maybe you\u2019ll join the next one \u2014 and when compounded contribute greatly to your office\u2019s wellbeing.We can not control the home environments of our employees, but we can make sure we do not intrude on them. Complete corporate wellness programs must have policies that respect rest and life outside of work.Suggested policies include:If an employee reports that they need more time to finish their work outside of work, then we must assume that either their workload is too large for their position, the company does not have sufficient personnel, or management has failed to train them for their position. What\u2019s not acceptable is encouraging this employee to work harder or longer. Hard work and hustle, in most cases, will be recognized, but they will never beat quality of work. A complete corporate wellness program is set-up to deliver the best quality of work possible.These suggestions actively work against burnout and the narrative that we must always be working. When implemented and managed correctly they have the potential to completely update an office culture for the better.Eating without devices, and joining company run clubs have been previously suggested, but with alternate desired outcomes. The benefit of many well-crafted wellness policies are their ripple effects. Eating without a device provides the opportunity to dine with another, and company run clubs bring teammates together. What these both foster is community.Community, language, and love are the less tangible components of a wellness program, but this is exciting. With less of a blueprint, Chief Wellness Officer\u2019s can create company-specific policies. Consider communication.Rather than sign emails or slack messages Thank You, encourage employees to insert an emotion or a feeling. This may manifest as With Gratitude, An Excited Teammate, With Great Appreciation, or Kindly, personal words that still mean something. Or, play a weekly game called Proud-Admire, where teammates pair off and begin by telling their partner what they are proud of themselves for, and what they admire the other for. Small offerings, with great rewards.And we shouldn\u2019t always motivate with rewards, but if we are going to ask companies to truly invest in corporate wellness programs we must be willing to share the anticipated return.41% of employees would take a 10% pay cut for a company that cares more about their health and wellness. With a healthier workforce, we can forecast spending less on health care, preserving more funds for wages, events, or wellness.By investing in employee wellness programs, companies see a return in the quality of work, increased employee satisfaction, and decreased medical spending. A healthier and happier workforce leads to higher retention, decreased HR spending, and more efficient business.If all roads lead to Rome, then all wellness programs lead to the Argentarii.A decade ago companies began increasing the availability of alcohol in their workplaces in an effort to recruit top talent. Today, that same top talent agrees that 24\/7 access to craft beer taps no longer excites them.They\u2019re incentivized by wellness programs now.Though it may not be a companies responsibility to promote the wellbeing of its employees, there are significant reasons to do so. Sometimes, a wellness program may not require the introduction of new activities, so much as the ending of outdated ones.I believe it\u2019s time for companies across the States to wake up. If Tobacco, Diet, and Alcohol are the three leading causes of preventable death, why do we only banish one from our offices, and actively invite the other two in?To completely outlaw all alcohol, or poor diet choices, may be too extreme for some, but what is reasonable to ask is that employers no longer actively participate in the decline of their employee's health by purchasing and providing food and drink that is known to harm them.Richie.

The answer may be yes (at least for men), at least according a new study published in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/31628477) last month.Researchers from the Universities of Bath and Birmingham (United Kingdom), respectively performed a six week study. They looked at thirty men classified as overweight or obese, assigning the to one of two intervention groups: 1) those who would eat breakfast before exercise; and 2) those who would eat breakfast after exercise. Investigators also created a control group that made no changes in lifestyle.Here are the study results: Those who performed exercise before breakfast burned double the amount of fat compared to the group that exercised after breakfast.The investigators then asked why this was the case. They discovered that increased fat burning is mainly secondary to lower insulin levels during exercise when individuals fasted overnight. This allows them to use more of the fat from their fat tissue and the fat within muscles as fuel.Interestingly, there were no differences in weight loss over the six week study period, according to the timing of exercise. The study authors offered that the pre-breakfast exercise subjects had \u201cprofound and positive\u201d effects on their health, as their bodies were better able to respond to insulin. This in turn allowed their bodies to keep blood sugar levels under control and potentially lower the risk of diabetes and of heart disease.With respect to insulin response, the study participants who exercised after breakfast were no better than the control group. This study suggests that performing exercise in the overnight-fasted state can increase the benefits of exercise for individuals, without changing the intensity or duration of the exercise session. Let\u2019s look at why insulin sensitivity is important.Insulin ResistanceInsulin resistance is a metabolic disorder that occurs when your body cells cannot take in insulin properly. Insulin, produced in the pancreas, is a hormone that helps the body to use energy from glucose (a form of sugar) from digested food, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.In essence, insulin is the key that unlocks the door to your cells. In order for glucose to exit the blood and enter the cell, the door needs to be opened. If you are insulin resistant, your pancreas continues to produce those keys, but the locks (receptors on cells that absorb blood sugar) are not working as efficiently as they should.Now, that is a problem, as insulin not only regulates blood sugar, but is also important for a myriad of other body functions. If you are insulin resistant, you have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes; in fact insulin resistance is the single best predictor of who will develop diabetes over the ensuing ten to twenty years. Insulin resistance can also raise the probability of heart disease and other health problems.So what should you do?Watch your weight. We know that one of the major causes of insulin resistance is excess body fat. In fact, nearly everyone that is overweight is insulin resistant. We actually don\u2019t fully understand why this is the case. It may be that as people get fatter, their fat cells store more fat. At a certain point, those fat cells stop being able to take in more fat, and begin to release it into the bloodstream.Others, including Yale biologist Gerald Shulman, posit that when people gain too much fat, it tends to accumulate in places it should not be, including the liver and muscle cells. This excess fat storage interferes with the ability to process insulin properly.Those of us who are not overweight or obese may not be entirely off the hook. Approximately twelve percent of people with insulin resistance are lean. It may be that they have some genetic pre-disposition to faulty insulin processing as they age.Watch your sleepSleep disorders such as sleep apnea may predispose individuals to insulin resistance.Keep moving.Inactivity can lead to insulin resistance, according to the National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse. Muscle tissue uses more glucose that do other types of tissues, and become even more efficient after exercise. By exercising regularly, you give you muscles a chance to improve your insulin uptake.Consider medications.Some patients may benefit from a drug known as metformin. This medication reduces how much glucose the liver makes and prompts the muscles and other tissues to take up more blood sugar. Metformin can improve cholesterol levels and blood vessel function, but has downsides (including an increase in appetite).I\u2019m Dr. Michael Hunter.Written byWritten by","16565":"Using the Correct Pronouns and Gay Fangirling Isn\u2019t EnoughI like to think I\u2019m a good, blue-blooded liberal.I have gay relatives and lesbian friends. I watched Armie Hammer and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet kiss in \u201cCall Me by Your Name\u201d and loved it. Netflix and Amazon\u2019s recommended content for me is at least 60 percent gay.On Facebook, Instagram or Twitter, I like and share posts about diversity and #LGBTQ. I learned about pronouns, and I know how to use them.I can relate to being an \u201cother.\u201d I\u2019m a Filipina immigrant. I get it. I do. There was no way I wasn\u2019t an ally.Being an ally was all about assuaging my sense of social justice and shaking my fist, and I\u2019m all about shaking my fist.Being an ally was all about assuaging my sense of social justice and shaking my fist, and I\u2019m all about shaking my fist.It\u2019s all of these awesome things that set me \u2014 a cisgender, straight woman \u2014 on the road to ally failure.But writing an article on LGBTQ+ health got me to look at my own shortcomings, prejudices, and biases, and talking to community members helped me understand different perspectives.Being an ally is about more than just words or ideals. It\u2019s about actions.The word \u201cally\u201d isn\u2019t a noun. It\u2019s a verb.Writing for Drugwatch.com allows me plenty of fist shaking in the name of justice. I relish the fact that I get to educate consumers and call out Big Pharma for making money off drugs that make people sicker and medical devices that disfigure and disable people.I thrive off giving a voice to people whose lives have changed forever because of corporate negligence and greed. When my editor gave me an assignment to write about LGBTQ+ health, I thought I had it all figured out.Like other cisgender, straight people, I thought I knew what the community needed and wanted. I read the Atlantic and listened to NPR, right?Like other cisgender, straight people, I thought I knew what the community needed and wanted. I read the Atlantic and listened to NPR, right?I\u2019m a health researcher and writer, so I go for the stats from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, HIV.gov or Fenway Health:The problem was I was still looking at these statistics as a straight, cisgender person trying to educate other straight cisgender people about the health issues of LGBTQ+ people.I wouldn\u2019t know what the community needed unless I actually reached out to them and wrote for them. So I did.I found out that most LGBTQ+ community members can\u2019t even find a doctor. Even worse, many don\u2019t go because they would rather suffer through health problems than suffer through ridicule.\u201cI am scared to go back to therapy because my therapist that knew everything about me and was a lesbian moved,\u201d Mateo Cox, a 24-year-old Latino transgender man from Massachusetts, told me. \u201cI am worried to come out to a therapist and am worried that they might be abusive.\u201dAs a cisgender, straight female, I worry about doctors pushing drugs on me, but I never worry about abuse or discrimination. For me, health care is a privilege.My interviews started with health, but by the end of the journey, it was about so much more than that. I learned how I chose to selectively support the community, rather than being the ally they needed.My support of the community had been a bit lopsided and biased to the \u201cG\u201d since most of my exposure was to gay men. Lesbians came in a distant second, and I didn\u2019t personally know any transgender or gender non-binary people.It turns out that when a lot of people think of the LGBTQ+ community, they just think of gay men, according to Joel Morales, Director of Operations for the LGBTQ+ Center in Orlando.\u201cIt\u2019s not about servicing gay people. It\u2019s about marginalized individuals,\u201d Morales said to me about his work at The Center. \u201cIn the work we do, we try to reach the most marginalized individuals like the trans black woman. Once I reach those people, I feel everyone else gets uplifted as a whole.\u201dIn order to be an ally, you can\u2019t just be a fan of one sub group in the community. You have to be an ally to the entire spectrum of sexual and gender identities. As a writer, I would have to try to understand more of the segments under the big, beautiful umbrella that is LGBTQ+.So in the time I had to write my piece, I reached out to the L, B and T. In the process, I learned more about the G, too.In my strict adherence to political correctness, I didn\u2019t want to ask about HIV or AIDS.In my strict adherence to political correctness, I didn\u2019t want to ask about HIV or AIDS. I thought my cisgender, straight discomfort with the issue extended to the gay community. But I did ask, and it is still the community\u2019s greatest concern.\u201cGenerationally, the older folks in the community are probably more educated than the younger ones about HIV and AIDS,\u201d Christopher said. \u201cThe young ones didn\u2019t live through the AIDS crisis and that makes them not realize how serious it was at the time.\u201dFor example, a part of the new face of the HIV\/AIDS crisis is getting community members to understand PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis. The most popular PrEP drug is Truvada, a pill that can prevent HIV transmission. While the drug has a few serious risks like liver, kidney and bone damage, it is a powerful tool against preventing new HIV cases.And while new infection rates have stabilized, new HIV transmissions have increased among Latino and African American gay and bisexual men, according to the CDC.For lesbians, reproductive health remains one of the biggest concerns.\u201cI think the biggest issue I\u2019ve had with being a cis woman identifying as a lesbian and being in a relationship with another cis woman is along the lines of reproductive health,\u201d Brittani, a 28-year-old lesbian from Kansas told me. \u201cI have a lot of issues with period regularity, and the only recommendation I\u2019ve ever gotten is to \u2018get on birth control and that\u2019ll help.\u2019\u201dGetting on a drug she doesn\u2019t need and doesn\u2019t work for her is frustrating to Brittani, but providers only know to offer her a solution for heterosexual women.It\u2019s easy to be an ally in private when it\u2019s just you and your LGBTQ+ friend, family member, or co-worker. The real challenge comes when you are out in the world and you witness discrimination in action \u2014 especially from a friend.I know there have been times when I could have acted or spoken up, but a kind of social paralysis came over me.Cox has watched his friends hang out with \u201cproud transphobes.\u201d\u201cA lot of my friends have been great. They haven\u2019t misgendered me once or dead named me once,\u201d Cox told me. \u201cHowever, I get frustrated when I see them hanging out with people who are known to be proud transphobes. I had a conversation with them recently and asked, \u2018Would you hang out with racist people?\u2019 They said, \u2018Oh, no, of course not. That\u2019s horrible.\u2019 Okay, then why is transphobia seen as not as serious?\u201dYou have to step outside yourself and hold people accountable for not being allies, Cox said. That means not supporting businesses, musicians, or artists who discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. Being an ally isn\u2019t about passively being okay with LGBTQ+ people existing.\u201cIt\u2019s great that you call me \u2018he\u2019 and by my proper pronouns, but it you don\u2019t call out your own friends for saying transphobic things\u2026 then that\u2019s a problem. If transphobia is not a deal breaker for you then you cannot call yourself an ally,\u201d Cox said.\u201cIf transphobia is not a deal breaker for you then you cannot call yourself an ally.\u201d \u2014 Mateo Cox, 24-year-old transgender man from MassachusettsSurprisingly, divides also exist within the LGBTQ+ community.\u201cIt isn\u2019t all Kumbaya, and we all understand each other\u2019s plights and struggles,\u201d Christopher told me. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like we don\u2019t want to deal with it. While we are supposed to be one community, I think there is still a lot of misunderstanding.\u201dIssues of race also exist within each subgroup. For example, Cox says that as a Latino transgender man, he doesn\u2019t get to speak in forums until the white transgender people \u201cget the microphone first.\u201d\u201cWhite trans men get a lot of attention in social media. Black trans women only get attention when they are murdered,\u201d he said.Part of being an ally is using your privilege to make sure the \u201cmicrophone\u201d goes to the most marginalized people in a minority group.As a health writer with deadlines, the easiest thing to do is ask Dr. Google. It can be difficult to remember that the numbers and statistics on a page have names, identities, and struggles. I\u2019ve spent hours wading through peer-reviewed journals and bottomless, poorly organized government websites.It\u2019s a great way to write statistically sound pieces full of dizzying and shocking statistics. The thing is: You won\u2019t find humanity there.I\u2019ve always enjoyed being able to talk to people and tell their stories.Human connection is detrimental to narrow-mindedness.Health is a very personal thing that crosses lines of race, class, and gender identity. It\u2019s more personal for marginalized communities that have to navigate politics on a daily basis and advocate for themselves everywhere they go.I didn\u2019t do anything groundbreaking to learn my \u201cinsider\u201d information. I just left the comfort and anonymity of the internet and talked to actual members of the LGBTQ+ community.AT&T said it best in its 1987 commercial advising people to \u201creach out and touch someone.\u201d Human connection is detrimental to narrow-mindedness.Am I the ally the LGBTQ+ community wants me to be? No. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t work toward it.Written byWritten by","16603":"The funny thing about calling this ride The Wellness Ride is that in the process of delivering wellness to over 2,000 people, I lost mine.I don\u2019t count calories, gym gains, or my weight, but I keep myself in what I like to call \u201cLife Shape.\u201d If a friend invites me to hike, I know my body can, if I\u2019m invited to Kayak the ocean, I know I can, and if I decide to ride my bike across America, I know I\u2019ll be able to.Life shape.Prior to the ride, I was pretty consistent with my daily practices. I slept for 8\u20139 hours, I ate plants, I moved naturally, and I meditated each morning. Knowing how great I felt when my day was built on this foundation, I made a daily check-list for the ride in the notes app on my iPhone.Wake up, Meditate, 5 Minute Yoga, Hydrate, Snack, Check-Bike, Ride.As minimal as I could go while still touching all the pieces I felt necessary.By the time I reached New Jersey, at the beginning of week 2, one of these was already forgotten. I had lost my meditation practice.I sit on the same pillow, in the same corner of the same room each day for my practice, and finding comfort in new places, and the confidence to practice in public was uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t have the discipline to keep this practice despite my awareness of its benefits. I deleted Meditate from my morning list.Later that week, I deleted 5 Minute Yoga. I justified this by explaining to myself that if I used riding a stationary bike to warm-up for exercises in a gym, then why don\u2019t I just use the first few miles of each day\u2019s ride to warm up and get into my body, it will save me time. I must have forgotten my two herniated discs that the morning yoga helped alleviate pain from.Sleep and my diet came next, though I forget in which order. I found myself glued to my phone until my eyes closed and checking it first thing in the morning. Not only did this affect the length and quality of my sleep, but it created a dependency and interfered with my ability to process the ride. I became obsessed with engagement. How many views did a video get, how many reads on my latest writing, how many liked my Instagram post or responded to my story that day? It was unhealthy and dishonest. I lied to myself, claiming my compulsive social stat checking was important because a larger audience would drive more donations, but that was an afterthought. I was checking on behalf of my ego.As for food, I started the ride carrying and consuming bananas, apples, nut butter, and dates, restocking at grocery stores when I came across them. I kept the dates in a Tupperware container strapped onto the rear of my bike facing the sun. The sun would heat them all day, making for a gooey dessert when dipped into the nut butter. For dining, Mexican restaurants became a safe zone, ordering off their sides menu: beans, rice, veggies, and guacamole.Somewhere in Middle America though, the grocery stores were less frequent and the Mexican restaurants gone, taking my willingness to search with them. I was now riding through intersections of Gas Stations and Dollar Generals. When I wasn\u2019t replacing my meals with Subway vegetable footlongs, extra veggies, and filling my water bottles with on tap Vitamin Water, I\u2019d snack on potato chips and other \u201cvegan\u201d treats from these gas stations. Despite the lack of nutritional value, I was keeping my promise of riding across America as a vegan.That is until Kansas.What Kansas is not, is flat. What Kansas is, is gorgeous rolling hills. What Kansas has for healthy dinner options when riding US-24W is limited.I completed another 100-mile day when I checked into a smoke scented non-smoking room in Hill City, Kansas. I showered and googled any dining options in the town. The local gas station is a top choice. But so was Pizza Hut. I didn\u2019t hold back. I ordered garlic bread and a veggie lovers pizza. Sure, I could have asked my server to hold the cheese but at this point, I was so hungry and so tired, that my education and commitment were suppressed, and I just wanted a fucking pizza.I ate it all.This action subconsciously gave me permission, so by the time I was riding the deserts of Utah, Nevada, and eastern California, at most gas stations, I\u2019d destroy 1\u20132 Ice Cream Cookie Sandwiches to soothe my dry throat, even when ice cold water was free and feet away.I am proud that I finished the ride, physically unharmed, but this ride exposed that even those so committed and educated on the benefits or dangers of food can, under certain circumstances, actively choose to consume food that harms them. Consider someone less invested, less educated, less incentivized?Ice cream cookie sandwiches and a Kansas Pizza Hut, themselves, did not strip me of my wellness. They were, however, contributing to what was already growing. I had removed Meditation and 5 Minute Yoga from my morning routine and encroached on my preferred diet, all before crossing the halfway point.Despite the compromises I made with myself, these first 2000 miles taught me something. I learned is that my body is resilient, years of training it has made it that way, but my mind is not.I began to crack during my 4 days on the Katy Trail in Missouri\u2026 riding in thunderstorms.I left St. Louis after an event on a Saturday around 4 pm and found the Katy Trail. I was already a bit emotional. Earlier that day, my laptop broke. I rushed to the Apple store where I was informed that my warranty had expired 5 weeks prior, and my options were to either spend $550 to have my laptop\u2019s logic board fixed or, purchase a new one. I was told that if I chose to fix it, Apple could return it within 2 weeks. I\u2019d be somewhere in the Rocky Mountains by then. I purchased a new one. A bold, possibly irrational decision, considering I suffer with extreme financial stress in general AND was already $450 over budget for the ride. But, the sun was setting, social media needed me to edit a video that evening, and I needed to edit the next day\u2019s newsletter. I processed all of this in a matter of minutes, but you can now see how my deletion of meditation and clouded relationship with social media positioned me to believe I needed a new laptop that instant.I stayed at a stranger\u2019s house that evening and woke up the next day energized. I can\u2019t change the past, but I can choose how I react to it. I was going to have a great day.By the time my 3 miles of \u201cwarm-ups\u201d were through, the clouds had arrived and began to empty. I rode 56 miles in thunderstorms and mud that day before I had enough. The next day was the same, pulled from the trails that afternoon by Tornado Sirens in Jefferson City. The next 2 days, more of the same: soaking wet, covered in mud, pedaling in what felt like quicksand. For 4 days, I was dry only when I slept.On each of these 4 days, I knew the conditions before riding. Still, staring directly at the sky, aware of the amount of misery and suffering I would meet on that day\u2019s ride, I opted in. I volunteered to be defeated. I kept thinking, if Einstein\u2019s loose definition of insanity \u201cdoing something over and over again, and expecting a different result\u201d is true, then is what I\u2019m doing a version of this? Was this insanity?Maybe, but I didn\u2019t see any other options. I wasn\u2019t going to slow down and shack up for a day or two because I was now more than $1,000 over budget, I wasn\u2019t going to hitchhike or take a bus because it would ruin the integrity of biking across the country, and I wasn\u2019t going to quit. The only option I had was forward.I felt trapped.So trapped, that on that third day in Missouri, and this is the first time I\u2019ve shared this, I looked into the woods and wondered how long it would take for them to find me. If I found a vine strong enough, a tree high enough and jumped, could I disappear? Could I escape this ride?My mind was that weak.I also knew I wasn\u2019t brave enough to follow through on this, thus narrowing my options even more. The only option I had was forward. Forward into the suck.I was too proud to ask for help. Too weak to handle the ride. I had found my capacity.And by not dealing with this, returning to a practice that I know would help, I allowed the darkness to ferment.So much that by the time I reached Denver, despite having the opportunity to recharge, return to my practices, and write a new story for the final weeks, I did nothing. Too lazy. Too stubborn. Too blind to see that everything was not alright.That\u2019s the thing with an ill mind. We feel it, and hear its thoughts, but we don\u2019t recognize that they are out of the ordinary. We have too intimate a relationship with ourselves that we don\u2019t respond to the signals alerting us of danger.Others usually notice this for us. I was alone.Leaving Denver, frustration came quickly when I met surprise climbs, flat tires, and eventually, in Utah, the wind. In Las Vegas, 4 days before finishing the ride, I wrote that the wind completely broke me, and for the first time I feared that I had done permanent damage to myself. I was rejecting those that cared for me, those that cheered for me and retreating. Each hand that reached for me, I slapped away.4 days later, on September 23rd, the ride did end, and almost overnight I returned to myself.I returned to that same pillow in that same corner of my room, I returned to my diet, I returned to my sleep. So, it wasn\u2019t until writing this, months after the finish, that I was able to reflect honestly and accurately. Sure, I got my daily dose of Vitamin D, and I was moving my body naturally, but I wasn\u2019t sleeping well, eating well, or living well. I didn\u2019t speak to myself kindly, I didn\u2019t manage stress, and I didn\u2019t keep my community or compassion.I rode my bicycle across America to bring wellness to communities with individuals currently less fortunate than I, and in that process, I completely lost mine. The ride was challenging, mentally more than physically, and I think that no matter how difficult it got, my capacity to suffer was not going to let it defeat me, even when I wish it had.I chose to share this intimate experience of the ride as an apology, to those that interacted with a different me during the ride, and not to ask for forgiveness, but for compassion. Compassion, not only for myself and the person I transformed into during this ride but compassion for all beings.Each of us endures tragedy, and our hardships are non-competitive with each other. This ride exposed that extreme conditions such as thirst, hunger, exhaustion, or even lack of knowing where one will sleep can lead to temporary alternate mental states or even cause permanent damage.Each day, we interact with countless beings. Whether it is through direct verbal communication, our body language in public spaces, or eye contact, or lack thereof, each of these is an opportunity to embrace compassion.Mental Illness is a disease that no one is immune too. Compassion is an expression that no one is immune to as well. Choose to soften. Choose love.The other day I wrote an email to a friend explaining that I now feel that I have twice lived out my dreams. He challenged me about the ride and I admitted that I wouldn\u2019t have wanted a different experience. He asked me more about dreams, and if I\u2019ll slow down to which I informed him no way. Then he asked me what motivates me to go after my dreams.I told him the tragedy of deferring one.That\u2019s part 3.Richie.

It refers to bacteria that, when consumed, have beneficial effects on mood, motivation, and cognition.The gut has been called the \u201csecond brain\u201d because it produces many of the same neurotransmitters as the brain does, such as serotonin, dopamine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid, all of which play a key role in regulating mood. It\u2019s estimated that 90% of serotonin is made in the digestive tract.Perhaps it\u2019s not so surprising, then, that what affects the gut often affects the brain and vice versa. For example, when your brain senses trouble \u2014 the fight-or-flight response \u2014 it sends warning signals to the gut, which is why stressful events can cause digestive problems such as an upset stomach. On the flip side, flare-ups of gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease, or chronic constipation may trigger anxiety or depression.This is commonly referred to as the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis, and that axis is bidirectional, meaning the microbiota and gut are sending biochemical signals to the brain and vice versa. The primary information highway between the enteric nervous system (in the gut) and the central nervous system is the body\u2019s longest nerve: the vagus.When it comes to understanding how microbes, the gut, and the brain communicate, we have a lot to sort out. Fortunately, researchers in fields that include psychology, microbiology, and neurobiology are undeterred by the inevitable complexity and challenges. In the past several years, several studies have compiled convincing evidence that suggests the gut and its resident microorganisms influence cognition and mental health. As scientists learn more about the gut\u2013brain connection, they are moving closer to the prospect of treating psychiatric and behavioral disorders with dietary changes or \u201cpsychobiotic\u201d supplements filled with brain-benefiting microbes.Probiotics ResearchResearch has already uncovered some of the digestive and immune benefits of probiotics \u2014 live microorganisms in foods or supplements that benefit the health of their host. Now, scientists are finding that probiotics may help lower stress and anxiety, and boost mood and cognitive function.A study published by Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience found that Alzheimer\u2019s patients who for 12 weeks ingested milk made with four probiotic bacteria species scored better on a test to measure cognitive impairment compared with those who drank regular milk.In humans, six weeks of probiotic supplementation in patients with intestinal disorders resulted in a decrease in depressive complaints associated with the intestinal disease, which was related to decreased brain limbic reactivity to negative emotional stimuli (Pinto-Sanchez et al., 2017).A small 2013 study reported in the journal Gastroenterology (Tillisch et al., 2013) found that women who ate yogurt with a mix of probiotics twice a day for four weeks were calmer when exposed to images of angry and frightened faces compared with a control group. MRIs also found that the yogurt group had lower activity in the insula, the brain area that processes internal body sensations such as those emanating from the gut. This study\u2019s results should be interpreted cautiously due to certain limitations: small group sizes (10\u201312 subjects) and the comparison of the probiotics\u2019 effects with a non-intervention group rather than a placebo group. Nonetheless, existing evidence seems to suggest that probiotics do have effects on neural emotional reactivity in humans.Emotional reactivity is only one of various affective appraisal measures, which also include emotion-specific regulation and more generic cognitive-control components (Kohn et al., 2014; Etkin et al., 2015). Thus, although the effects of probiotics have been observed only on neural emotion reactivity, this connection may be related to emotional regulation or to higher-order cognitive control processes.In a study reported in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, male rats were injected with the immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory bacteria Mycobacterium vaccae once a week for three weeks to examine its effect on their brain, particularly regarding neuroimmune regulation, stress, and anxiety. Eight days after the final injection, the rats had higher levels of the anti-inflammatory protein interleukin-4 in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that deals with cognitive function, anxiety, and fear. They were less anxious when confronted with a dangerous situation and less likely to develop either colitis or brain inflammation. According to the study\u2019s lead author, Dr. Matthew Frank, \u201cWe found that in rodents, this particular bacterium, Mycobacterium vaccae, actually shifts the environment in the brain toward an anti-inflammatory state. If you could do that in people, it could have broad implications for a number of neuroinflammatory diseases.\u201d These findings are important because past studies have shown that brain inflammation increases the risk of mental disorders, partly by affecting mood-influencing neurotransmitters such as dopamine.A similar study explored whether M. vaccae could prevent postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a common problem for older adults after surgery (Neurobiology of Aging, Vol. 71, \u21161, 2018). POCD is associated with inflammation and is often a serious problem for adults over 60, causing marked declines in memory, concentration and information processing. Older rats, too, experience symptoms of POCD. \u201cWhen we immunized with the anti-inflammatory bacteria, it completely prevented the surgery-induced memory impairment,\u201d said Christopher A. Lowry, one of the study\u2019s authors. More work is needed to bridge the gap from mice to people, but the findings raise the possibility that beneficial bacteria could help people with cognitive and mental health problems. Now, Lowry is testing whether anti-inflammatory probiotics might reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in people.Three recent meta-studies that examined all of the human research in the field up to now came to the same conclusion: probiotics can lead to reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety, improve mood, and lower stress response in humans with or without depressive or anxiety disorders. Could all of this mean probiotic immunization is on the way to fend off anxiety, depression, and even post-traumatic stress disorder? It\u2019s too early to tell, but the hope is that determining the exact roles probiotics play in the microbiota\u2013gut\u2013brain axis will get us closer to those sorts of solutions.AutismA particularly remarkable finding is that probiotics may impact some of the symptoms of autism. Autism and gut health have been discussed for some time, as patients with the disorder typically suffer from a large number of digestive issues. Animal studies suggest the possibility that altering the gut bacteria in humans with autism might not only benefit their digestive system but also ameliorate some of the abnormal behaviors their disease leads them to exhibit.In 2016, a case study of a boy with severe autism reported that while the patient was being treated with probiotics for digestive problems, he spontaneously improved on the ADOS scale, a diagnostic rating system for people with autism. The score dropped from 20 down to a stable 17. According to the report, ADOS scores do not \u201cfluctuate spontaneously along time\u201d and are \u201cabsolutely stable,\u201d so this finding is at least suggestive that further research would be warranted. Because of such results, human studies are currently underway to determine whether probiotic supplements may not only improve the GI symptoms seen in autism but also have a positive impact on \u201cthe core deficits of the disorder, on cognitive and language development, and on brain function and connectivity.\u201dWhere next in the short term?As we\u2019re still in the early stages of understanding psychobiotics, it remains the case that dietary and lifestyle changes will still have a bigger impact on our mental health. But a few strains of bacteria have demonstrated beneficial effects on mood and anxiety in both animal studies and preliminary human studies \u2014 and the good news is that many of these are found in dairy-free coconut yogurt and other fermented foods. They include: Bifidobacteria species: B. longum, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bulgaricus; Lactobacillus species: L. helveticus, L. rhamnosus, L. plantarum, L. reuteri, L. casei, L. bulgaricus, and L. acidophilus. We also know that psychobiotics have synergistic effects, which means it\u2019s better to consume a mixture of them together rather than individually.The health and balance of your intestinal microbiota are hugely important for your entire body, and psychobiotics are just one nascent tool of many. The more diverse your gut flora, the smaller the likelihood of one microorganism wielding excessive influence that can result in microbial imbalances. To increase the diversity of your gut microbiota, eat a variety of greens, fiber-rich and probiotic-rich foods. A wide-ranging, nutritious diet is the key to gut health and potentially to mental and emotional wellness too.This article is for informational and educational purposes only.

I was working at Panera Bread and had completely messed up the entire morning shift single-handedly. Could you blame me? It was my first day.I decided after five hours of constant berating and abuse that I wasn\u2019t going to come to work the next day. Or the day after. Or the day after. In fact, I was quitting, but I wasn\u2019t going to tell them because screw them, that\u2019s why.It was a horrible thing to do. How millennial of me.I didn\u2019t quit because of the abuse. I played three years of high school football for crying out loud \u2014 I\u2019m used to being yelled at for hours. It wasn\u2019t that the job was hard \u2014 I used to mow lawns for 10 hours 6 days per week all summer.I quit because I knew deep down this wasn\u2019t the place for me. I wasn\u2019t meant to be slinging salads as a college graduate. I was meant to be calling the shots, the yelling was just the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.So I embarked on my freelancing journey right there, at age 22. I haven\u2019t looked back since. I\u2019m almost 27 now and I\u2019ve spent the last five years making all my money entirely online.I realized a lot of myths about work over this time period being self-employed, and I want to share them with you now.You know, 12 months ago I could\u2019ve never actually considered streaming games for a living.Work needs to be hard, right?I need to be writing seven blog posts per day, damn it. Even when I want to stop at two, I MUST write seven. Because I\u2019m hustling and the only way to get what I want is to grind the enamel off my teeth every single day.Well, the more I think about it, the more I realize that work doesn\u2019t have to be hard. That\u2019s just a common fallacy that\u2019s true 95% of the time, but not for everybody.There\u2019s a difference between hard work and working hard. Hard work is work that quite honestly sucks \u2014 like digging ditches. That sucks. Working hard is putting a lot of effort into whatever you\u2019re doing.People who stream games for 12 hours every day are working hard. They\u2019re having fun, but they\u2019re still working hard. I mean, their eyeballs are probably screaming for a fifteen-minute break by hour five.You don\u2019t need to feel bad for engaging in work that feels like play.I feel like a failure if I don\u2019t work 8 hours per day. Old beliefs die hard. I still believe in the deepest parts of my subconscious that if I\u2019m not working 8 hours, I am a gigantic slacker of epic proportions.I normally write one blog post every day and spend the rest of my time working on a future video.Furthermore, I have about 5\u20136 tasks on my typical daily to-do list. The tasks that bring me the most yield from a financial standpoint are my videos and blog posts. Everything else isn\u2019t essential.If I wanted to, I could write and make videos for 5\u20136 hours per day without any significant \u201chit\u201d to my bottom line.The truth is, there\u2019s a small window in everybody\u2019s day where they do their best work. Then their productivity dives off a cliff.I want to get my 6 solid hours in and call it a day. I\u2019m not going to do much of anything for the remaining two hours anyway, so I might as well do something fun like stream Call of Duty for two hours or go to Jiu-Jitsu.\u201cHow do you live in the Philippines Tom?\u201dWell, has it ever dawned on anyone that no I\u2019m not getting monthly wire transfers of $10,000 from my parents?I\u2019m actually working. I mean what else would I do?I\u2019m just working on my laptop. You\u2019d think that after the flood of digital nomad articles and videos we see that \u201cworking remotely\u201d wouldn\u2019t exactly be a surprise by now.\u201cI make money writing online.\u201d*Eye Squint*That\u2019s typically how that conversation goes with people.Granted, the eye squints all typically come from Boomers.I don\u2019t actually need to explain this one, do I? Welcome to 2019.The thing I feel bad for the most is taking an entire day off from work. I wake up, don\u2019t feel like writing a damn word, try my darndest to do it, then proceed to go back upstairs and sleep for four hours or go to the mall and watch a movie.At first, I feel like the biggest piece of dog shit imaginable, but after I get done watching my movie or waking up from my nap I feel about 400% better.I always feel better after my break.Most of the time when a mulligan day like this happens I feel incredible at work the next day.And what did I lose? 8 hours of work? Fine. I\u2019ll take that loss. It\u2019s not like I went into a coma and woke up 6 months later.Give yourself a damn break and take the day off every now and then.Get a few free writing tips from me here.Written byWritten by","16723":"The one reason a regular whole plant-based diet is the best all the timeI remember one day when a friend was telling me about a Bible passage in the creation \u2018\u2019And God proceedeth to settle Adam & Eve on Earth\u2019\u2019- Genesis 2:15. He was explaining what it meant TO BE SETTLED, i.e. everything mankind ever need is available for him on earth. So it is our fault really if we do not make use of what is available to us in promoting our health.I say this because I was intrigued by Science Direct Article on how it is possible to substitute aspirin with various fruits, vegetables and herbs in consuming the same active ingredient in Aspirin, (Salicylic Acid) to wad off some cancers.We are all aware that some doctors prescribe low doses of Aspirin (usually 75mg) to older adults as it helps lower the risk of some cancers, especially colorectal cancer. The active ingredients in the aspirin can also be found in some fruits and vegetables.According to Cancer Research, in UK, 42,000 new cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed every year, and this amounts to about 12% of all cancer cases. This prompted a Jama Network Open Study in older adults (66+):\u2014 2 to 3 times aspirin per month = 12% lower rate of colorectal cancer.\u2014 3 or more times aspirin per week = 15% reduced rate of any form of cancer, and a 44% reduced rate in colorectal cancer, although this depends also on their BMI.As in all pharmaceutical drugs, continuous use of aspirin has its own side effects, like internal bleeding. Also although it is meant to prevent some cancer, should users eventually have cancer, regular aspirin use could make the cancer drug-resistant. And this is very scary indeed. So it is like no one can win with pharmaceutical drugs and their side effects.Most fruits and vegetables have healing properties and without virtually no side effects. My personal interest in evidenced-based nutrition, enable me to research into some variety of fruits and vegetables that one can eat to get the same milligram of salicylic acid found in aspirin. The common ones are among others, Ginger, cinnamon, oregano, turmeric, mint, basil, bay leaves, nutmeg and cumin. Most of these can be found in organic herbal shops.Another paper by the American Journal of Clinical Pathology studied the level of salicylic acid in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian discovered that vegetarian has a higher level of salicylic acid in their system than non-vegetarian. The study found also found out that vegetarian has a lower level of colorectal cancer. This obviously is due to their plant-based diet, while omnivores have no salicylic acid at all in their system.The study is NOT to promote vegetarianism over other types of diet but to state categorically that a healthy plate should contain at least 80% plant-based food. Diary, fish and meat do not contain salicylic acid, an Australian study found. It is important to stress that organic fruits and vegetables always contain more nutrients than non-organic, and the fact that it has little or no pesticides is an added advantage.A Molecular Diversity Preservation International (MDPI) study into the relative course of Salicylic Acid in cancer prevention found out that the same metabolite called 2,4,6-trihydroxy benzoic acid (referred to as 2,4,6 \u2014 THBA) found in Aspirin that enables it to slow down the growth of cancer cells is also present in large quantities in fruits and vegetables.So when vegetables are taken, the phytonutrients and flavonoids in them also release the 2,4,6, \u2014 THBA, that prevents cells division. This acts by giving good cells more time to repair the DNA and fight off any damage cells. It is the damage cells that do metabolize into cancer cells.The study only focuses on one item in aspirin, and if you consider that the phytonutrients are many and varied in fruits and vegetables, your guess is as much as mine to the tremendous benefits of adding them in plentiful to your meal.Written byWritten by","16726":"Depression levels are at an all-time high. Among people aged 15 to 45, depressive disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide. In 2020, depression will for the first time be the top cause of disability in the US.Not until relatively recently has serious, systematic clinical attention been paid to the role of diet in mental health in terms of prevention, causation, and treatment. Now, there is such recognition of the importance of diet for mental health that a new field of medicine has arisen: nutritional psychiatry.An overview of this emerging field, published in November 2019 by the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, noted: \u201cWhile the determining factors of mental health are complex, increasing evidence indicates a strong association between a poor diet and the exacerbation of mood disorders, including anxiety and depression, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions.\u201d1While neuropsychiatric conditions are multifaceted, and factors such as genes and early life trauma are not readily altered or offset, diet is something we can address \u2014 with, as it turns out, often very significant results.We\u2019re still learning about the many ways that nutrition has an impact on mental well-being, but substantial research in nutritional psychiatry strongly suggests that the microbiome\u2013gut\u2013brain axis is extremely relevant for an individual\u2019s brain development, emotions, and behavior. The authors of a 2015 review titled \u201cThe Gut Microbiome and Psychiatry\u201d concluded: \u201cThe recognition that the gut microbiota interacts bidirectionally with other environmental risk factors, such as diet and stress, suggests promise in the development of interventions targeting the gut microbiota for the prevention and treatment of common mental health disorders.\u201d2What are some of the ways a healthy microbiome and good nutrition may affect mental well-being? Combating free radicals, lowering oxidative stress, reducing inflammation, bolstering the immune system, and boosting serotonin levels are a few, and all of these can be heavily influenced by what we put in our mouths.Inflammation is the immune system\u2019s normal response to tissue injury of any kind, including trauma, heat, toxins, and infectious agents. Currently, some research on depression is looking at its association with inflammation in the brain, and how the immune system may play a role in the development of stress and depressive symptoms.Cytokines have drawn interest as indicators of high inflammation levels. Consistently, researchers are finding that people who experience major depressive disorders have high cytokine levels in their blood.How do bacteria fit in here? We now know that the billions of \u201cgood\u201d bacteria in the gut\u2019s microbiota limit inflammation, as well as protecting the intestinal lining in its vital role as a barrier against toxins, and activating neural paths that allow direct communication between brain and gut. Researchers are also finding evidence that these bacteria\u2019s effects extend beyond the gut, reducing inflammation levels elsewhere in the body.It\u2019s widely understood that neurotransmitters play a major role in our mood. The best known of these, serotonin, assists with regulating mood, sleep, and appetite and reducing pain. Remarkably, 95% of a person\u2019s serotonin is produced in their GI tract, which contains approximately a hundred million neurons. It\u2019s now known that serotonin production is highly affected by gut bacteria, as is the functioning of these intestinal neurons.It makes sense that our gut health has a tremendous effect on what gets transmitted to our brains, influencing our emotions and mental well-being. Given all this, how can we reassess our diets to give ourselves a better chance of preventing or combating depression?Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the research point to a number of promising approaches. A 2013 article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported that diets high in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and fish may lower an adult\u2019s risk of depression.3 Another meta-analysis published that same year found that following the \u201cMediterranean diet\u201d \u2014 rich in plant foods and lean meat such as wild salmon \u2014 might reduce the risk of depression by 30%.4 A 2017 meta-analysis of 21 studies from 10 countries concluded: \u201cA dietary pattern characterized by a high intake of fruit, vegetables, gluten free whole grain, fish, olive oil, low-fat dairy and antioxidants and low intakes of animal foods was apparently associated with a decreased risk of depression. A dietary pattern characterized by a high consumption of red and\/or processed meat, refined grains, sweets, high-fat dairy products, butter, potatoes and high-fat gravy, and low intakes of fruits and vegetables is associated with an increased risk of depression.\u201d5Rising anxiety and depression rates among the very young also make the possibility of dietary interventions very important. A 2014 systematic review of the relationship between diet and mental health in children and adolescents found that higher intakes of foods with saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, and processed food products were associated with poorer mental health.6In 2017, a large randomized controlled trial found that what you eat could help treat or prevent brain-based disorders, especially depression. Researchers here identified \u201csignificant reductions in depression symptoms\u201d from dietary interventions, independent of other factors, including smoking rates and physical activity.7These associations between diet and depression are independent of other confounding factors such as education, income, body weight and other health behaviors.Researchers caution that much more study is needed to establish and understand connections between nutrition and mental health. In the meantime, though, you might wish to explore several different ways that diet can be adjusted to potentially reduce the risk of depression and assist in treating it.One simple thing to examine is sugar consumption. It\u2019s now known that diets high in refined sugars make insulin regulation more difficult and harm the brain by promoting inflammation and oxidative stress. A 2015 article published by the Harvard Medical School noted that \u201cmultiple studies have shown a correlation between a diet high in refined sugars and impaired brain function and a worsening of symptoms of mood disorders, such as depression.\u201d8Let\u2019s get back to those gut bacteria, because they\u2019re of course profoundly affected by what we feed ourselves. It\u2019s now known that the more diverse the plant foods in your diet, the more diverse your gut microbiota, so the healthier, stronger, and more robust your gut will be. The types of fats you eat are also important. Short-chain fatty acids are good for our gut, and they affect gene activity, metabolism, and body weight; they also profoundly influence our immune system, which in turn affects our risk for depression.Omega-3 fatty acids are important too. A 2017 study found a correlation between omega-3 consumption and more beneficial gut microbiome composition.9 Notably, a recent review article for lay readers observed that \u201cmany studies point to the power of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet to improve symptoms of anxiety and depression and even play a role in the prevention of suicide,\u201c citing several peer-reviewed research publications.10Polyphenols also play a key role for the gut and its bacteria, and they may assist in preventing depression. Excellent sources include berries, beans, dark chocolate, black and green teas and hazelnuts.While numerous foods such as these can improve the gut environment for existing bacteria, you can also add beneficial bacteria to your gut in the form of probiotics. These are found in cultured and fermented foods, such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi. Interestingly, multiple studies suggest that probiotics can help improve symptoms of anxiety and mood disorders in people with clinically diagnosed disorders, as well as those who are otherwise healthy but experience some of the symptoms of mental health conditions.Bacteria need their own foods too, called \u201cprebiotics.\u201d These are forms of dietary fiber digestible by our gut bacteria but not by us. They\u2019re found in numerous fruits and vegetables, which handily also contain many other nutrients beneficial for our physical and mental health.Consult your physician who practices functional medicine, about making dietary adjustments to help your mental health. Work together to identify the root cause and then address your nutrient imbalances. Your physician can order the correct labs to check nutritional deficiencies such as iron, magnesium, potassium, selenium, and zinc, as well as the B vitamins (particularly thiamine, folate, B6, and B12) and vitamins A, C, and D. It\u2019s also essential to eliminate gastrointestinal issues such as irritable bowel syndrome, small-intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), intestinal permeability, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies. Having an allergy to one or more foods can lead to a metabolic disorder that cascades into a whole host of symptoms, including \u201cbrain fog\u201d and depression. Gluten and dairy are very common allergens. Interestingly, partially digested wheat and dairy particles called gliadorphins and casomorphins are found in the urine of severely depressed patients. Eating more organic, nutrient-dense leafy and cruciferous vegetables is one of the few ways that research suggests we can protect ourselves against depression.Further illuminating research in the area of nutritional psychiatry will no doubt be forthcoming. Stay tuned, and don\u2019t forget to incorporate other behaviors known to support good mental health: regular physical activity, good and sufficient sleep, time in nature, and a healthy work\u2013life balance.This article is for informational and educational purposes only.

It was a desperate plea, one that unfortunately fell on deaf ears.It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t want to go counseling per say, but rather that doing so required more motivation than I could muster. You had to do all sorts of logistics, like finding one close to you that also covered your insurance, and also finding a therapist that was a good fit. I also didn\u2019t have a car, so I had to also make sure the place was actually close to a bus or lightrail stop. All these things were way too much for me, a depressed 18-year old fresh out of high school.The funny thing is I did have a good therapist recently that was only a five minute walk away. She was extremely cheap because she was part of my college\u2019s Health & Counseling center, so money was not an issue. Problem is, I had reached the ten session limit imposed by my college. Once you reached it, you were locked out of the college counseling system entirely. You couldn\u2019t schedule any mental health related appointments, and you were basically on your own to figure out where to go next.The hope was that after those ten sessions you\u2019d be \u201cbetter\u201d and wouldn\u2019t need counseling anymore. But for most of us with severe mental illnesses, ten sessions is far from enough to recover.Truth be told, I was in need of weekly sessions but that was impossible with my college\u2019s system. Once I ran out of sessions, I was unable to find a replacement counseling center. So I stopped trying to find a new therapist. And my mental health got progressively worse as the college year went by.Finally I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I didn\u2019t have the motivation to go to a physical counseling center and get the help I so desperately needed, but I knew I couldn\u2019t continue on like this. So I was desperate. And then I finally caved for the company with annoying ads I kept seeing on Instagram. I hit the search button and soon found myself on TalkSpace.You\u2019ve probably seen the aggressive ads on social media or at least heard the chatter about the app. The online therapy service promises to improve your mental health without all the hassle and cost of traditional counseling. Unlike some online therapy services like 7Cups that rely on trained volunteers and function primarily for one time sessions, Talkspace offers real certified therapists and is set up for multiple appointments.Once the app is downloaded and you\u2019ve completed a mental health evaluation and some basic info about yourself, you\u2019ll be matched with a therapist and recommended a payment plan based on your needs. If you like them, you can chat with the same therapist for pretty much your whole time on Talkspace if you want. If you don\u2019t, you can request to switch therapies.Essentially Talkspace is promising to offer professional therapy online. But Talkspace\u2019s services are a far cry from traditional counseling in reality, and not for the better. For one, unless you\u2019ve got the premium plan (most people don\u2019t) you\u2019re regulated to text message sessions. You can\u2019t do video or even audio chat. On the other hand, Talkspace is flexible no matter what. Rather than have a certain meeting time, you can simply text your therapy whenever. The therapist will then respond during the hours they set.To lazy and disorganized me at the time, this sounded great. There was no need to worry about running late to appointments and I could talk about my feelings from the confines of my dorm room in PJs. So I signed up, did the mental health evaluation and got matched with a therapist in my state.My matched therapist was friendly enough. According to her bio she liked kayaking and hiking outdoors and specialized in marriage counseling. Aside from asking a few questions about my life and what I wanted out of therapy, I was free to talk about whatever I wanted.I told her about stress with classes and whined about friend drama. My therapist listened attentively to all of it, even the junk. She\u2019d often recommend practices like mediation and breathing exercises, all stuff that is pretty standard for counseling. But unlike my previous IRL sessions, something was different.Because we communicated via text and had different schedules, conversations were slow and inpersonal. Sometimes I\u2019d text her in moments of stress or during a breakdown after something bad had happened and she wouldn\u2019t respond for days.Those moments were agony for me as I awaited her response. Even though knew she probably just hadn\u2019t had time to reply back yet, I kept stressing that she was looking at my messages and thinking I was crazy or a weirdo. I wondered if she thought my problems were stupid and unimportant. I felt like I was an annoyance in her life and she was secretly was hoping I would stop talking to her.When did she did finally text back, her messages were short and to the point. They weren\u2019t cold per say; but they did make me feel silly for sending her walls of text.In IRL therapy, you don\u2019t get to look back at what you said before the therapist responds. But in virtual therapy, your emotional blunders are all recorded and displayed for you to see. I suppose it makes for good self reflection, but it has also made me feel embarrassed when I got emotional. Sometimes the panoroid part of me also wonders now too, if those personal anecdotes of mine are in the hands of not only Talkspace, but advertisers and researchers also.The therapist\u2019s advice was often vague and brief, making me sometimes wonder if I was secretly conversing with a chatbot. It was almost always accompanied by an emoji, which made me feel a bit unsightly when we discussed more serious topics like depression. Sometimes I felt like I was talking to a life coach and not a therapist.We talked about everything from social skills to the meaning of life. But nothing seemed to change after my digital conversations. My progress was at at a stand-still and there seemed to be nothing I could do. At first, I thought it was the therapist, but that didn\u2019t seem right. We had gotten along well and I wasn\u2019t afraid to open up to her.I considered cancelling but then what? I still couldn\u2019t go to IRL therapy so I figured some form of counseling was better than nothing. Besides, it wasn\u2019t like I was paying a fortune to go. $30 bucks a month seems miniscule in comparison to traditional therapy where one session can cost you $150 or more.So I kept on with my virtual therapist and her various advice techniques and smiley face emojis offered. When my depression skyrocketed, her one piece of advice was to try \u201cgrounding\u201d or a technique where I put my bare feet in dirt or grass to feel more connected to the Earth.Around this time, my health deteriorated to the point where dirty feet weren\u2019t going to save me. But I\u2019m not sure my therapist could tell that from across the screen. So I kept chatting, hoping she\u2019d offer a more useful technique to me.After I\u2019d finished a text, I\u2019d often sob in my twin sized bed before mellowing into an emotionless brick. I told her things got worse. She asked if I\u2019d tried IRL therapy. I said yes and told her I didn\u2019t have the time or the money to do it now.Then one day disaster struck. I broke up with a group of close friends and lost pretty all my social life as a consequence. I texted her the story in tears, hoping she\u2019d respond soon.When she did respond it was too late: I was in the hospital for attempted suicide when I received her text two days later. To be honest, I\u2019m not sure if a text could\u2019ve saved me anyways at that point.The suicide attempt showed me how not only how bad my mental health had gotten but also my way of treating it. It was a wakeup call that text therapy wasn\u2019t going to save me.Luckily my college finally decided that my mental health was so bad I\u2019d be allowed to go over my appointment limit, although without the cheap prices students normally get. I was fortunate enough to have a family willing to support my recovery and so I was able to return to IRL therapy.Today I\u2019m in a much better place and college is going much more smoothly for me. I\u2019m no longer constantly depressed or suicidal like I was freshman year, and I\u2019m actually enjoying life.I\u2019m not sure what would\u2019ve happened if I didn\u2019t have the option to go to traditional therapy and get the support I really needed. Maybe I would\u2019ve caved and tried to make text therapy work. Maybe I would\u2019ve given up on therapy all-together. Either way, the outcome wouldn\u2019t have been pretty.Therapy apps often defend themselves from critics by claiming they are not meant to replace traditional therapy and are meant for those who want help with small issues, not serious mental health problems. But their advertisements suggest otherwise. And many people will still look to these apps anyways because they have no other options due to the costs and scheduling traditional therapy demands.Maybe one day therapy apps will be a viable alternative to IRL therapy. But for now, they\u2019re much better as additional support rather than a supplement to old-fashioned therapy itself. Your virtual therapist might help you talk out relationship problems but they likely can\u2019t help your depression issues. And thus, virtual therapy shouldn\u2019t be seen as a low cost alternative. Or worse, a replacement.Written byWritten by","16888":"Or maybe it\u2019s your hips. Shoulders?When you were younger, you bounced back quickly \u2014 tension in your body didn\u2019t last long. But the older you get, the more frequently you feel it and the harder it seems to recover.Sound familiar?When it comes to our bodies, we all experience limitations from time to time. Our brain gives us reminders (like aches, tightness, loss of mobility or stability), but we\u2019re used to putting on a brave face and pushing through.Often we hope our situation will magically improve on its own, or worse \u2014 we accept these limitations as the new normal.In reality, unless you\u2019ve suffered an acute injury \u2014 there is no reason you need to live with discomfort or restricted mobility. In most cases, there are simple steps that anyone can take to correct imbalances and make positive change.Identifying the true cause of your imbalance is an important first step to improving the way your entire body moves. When you focus on these areas of opportunity, small changes can have a big impact.When we experience muscle tension or discomfort in a specific area of the body, it\u2019s natural to assume that that\u2019s where the problem came from \u2014 and the only place where we can solve it.If your back is feeling tight, you get a back massage \u2014 right?While this may provide relief in the short-term, usually it doesn\u2019t address the root cause of the issue. After a while, the tension returns and you\u2019re back where you started.The truth is \u2014 the working parts of your body are all, very literally, connected. Your shoulders, your neck, your ribs, your back, your hips \u2014 all of it.So when one part of your body isn\u2019t functioning well, you may feel the effects somewhere else. If your back is sore but your movement isn\u2019t restricted, that soreness is probably originating elsewhere.Your brain is smart. When something is out of whack with your body, it takes the path of least resistance to keep you moving with a minimum amount of energy or discomfort.This means that one area of your body will overcompensate for the problem area to protect you from injury or preserve some functionality.Cool! That\u2019s helpful, isn\u2019t it?The problem is that each part of your body is built to perform a specific function really well. When an area starts working overtime to compensate for other areas, it inevitably causes problems. You might start to experience a limited range of motion, weakness, localized aches or general discomfort.To find a solution that sticks around for the long-haul, you\u2019ve got to figure out where the issue is really coming from.These days, we spend more time in our seats than ever. Our bodies are made to move, and this sedentary lifestyle can be surprisingly hard on our bodies. Luckily, the solution is often simpler than you\u2019d think.When you spend a lot of time in your seat, your hip flexors shorten and your forward posture pulls the muscles around your pelvis into an unnatural position. This tension can quickly lead to discomfort and lower back aches.To make sitting more comfortable in the short-term, and less painful in the long-term, try exercises that open up the front of your hips and stabilize your core. This will take the pressure off your lower back and enable you to stay seated in an upright posture that feels as good as it looks.If you\u2019re tippity-tapping on your keyboard all day, chances are your shoulders spend a lot of time shifted forward. This puts a lot of strain on the supporting muscles in your shoulders, as they work overtime trying to keep things stable.First, focus on light corrective exercises that open up your back and help your shoulders relax in their natural, neutral position. With the tension off your supporting muscles, you can start to stabilize your shoulders in the joint so that they can begin to move freely, the way you want them to.When you spend a lot of time sitting, your hips don\u2019t get to move and extend the way they\u2019re meant to. Your hip flexors shorten and your hips lock up, making them prone to feeling tight or sore.The best thing you can do for your hips is move \u2019em. You\u2019ll want to find exercises that help you lengthen your hip flexors and re-introduce some natural rotation in the hip joint. You\u2019ll be shaking those hips like Elvis on stage before you know it.When we identify the part(s) of your body requiring a shift and correct them, positive results can be immediate. Everyone has these areas of opportunity \u2014 little changes that can have a big impact on how the rest of our body functions.Relieving the stress that was holding everything back will make that particular area feel good, but it will also help the rest of your body move better, too.As the person on the front lines of your body\u2019s health, there\u2019s a lot you can do on your own to improve how you move, and how you feel. It doesn\u2019t need to be complicated, or take a long time. It doesn\u2019t need to cost a lot of money.So forget about that \u201cthing\u201d you thought you had (you don\u2019t have a bad back, your back was just doing a job it wasn\u2019t supposed to do).Your body isn\u2019t broken.You just need to focus your attention in the right place.Written byWritten by","16926":"The frailty of the existence and thin veneer of life get thrown into sharp relief when your ability to inhale and exhale have been compromised. Imagine, day after day, gasping for oxygen \u2014 walking up stairs, sitting at home, or just during a casual night out with friends. This has always been my life \u2026 it still is.I watched in horror as a venerable army of stuffed animals were trucked out of my bedroom and to an undisclosed location, never to be seen by me again.Pollen should be avoided. Basements became troublesome. Exercise with caution. Beware around dogs and cats. Watch yourself in the great outdoors. Don\u2019t get yourself all wound up. You don\u2019t know what mold is yet, but you will know it by the sound of your wheeze. And, for the love of all that\u2019s holy, be careful in the cold. Here\u2019s a cable-knit scarf. Wrap it around your head and don\u2019t, under any circumstances, take it off. This is your life. Or \u2026 as much of it as your lungs will allow you to live.My first real memory is of a nameless, faceless man being welcomed into my family\u2019s home almost 35 years ago, when I was a young, oblivious pup. (I assume in modern parlance these people are called \u201cMedical Device Technicians,\u201d but I can\u2019t truly be certain of said banalities.) He was carrying with him a bulky rectangular thing which could be opened up, and it looks a little something like this:Contained within: a transparent pliable tube and a spaceship-like plastic contraption, along with accouterments like an eye-dropper of tasteless, colorless fluid, and another glass vial of another tasteless, colorless fluid.So, to give you a crash-course in how this works: you take this spaceship-looking piece and unhook the top, fill the eye-dropper up to the 0.5 ml mark, and empty it into the spaceship-looking piece. Then, you crack both ends of a glass tube so liquid will dispense into the spaceship-looking piece.Then, you screw the top back on, plug a tube into an air compressor nozzle, plug the other end into the mouthpiece, and then place this mouthpiece into your mouth.I did this, and then I flipped a switch on the box, and listened to an unholy, whirring rumble fill the room. As the air compressor sucked pressure from the spaceship, the fluid began to steam. Deep breath in through the mouth. Deep breath out through the nose. I repeat this for 15 minutes. I am four years old, chained by a plastic tube to an electronic monolith.A quarter-hour later, after some 900 seconds of forcing a tyke to sit completely still, we were finished up. My parents asked me how I felt. I felt a little better. Compared to what? I do not know. I\u2019d been in and out of emergency rooms my entire life.And thus began a routine that commenced and concluded every day of my life for the next 15 years. A twice-, sometimes thrice-daily ritual that allowed me, aspiring to just be a regular kid, several hours of semi-uninhibited access to air. Some people can breathe for free. I never could \u2014 and I still can\u2019t. And it costs more every day.I have, for most of my life, been able to move air into and out of my lungs at somewhere between 50 and 60% normal for a human my size and age. That has, with rare exception, never changed. It has defined my life, and limited it in ways I will probably never fully understand or calculate. This has, predictably, occasionally made me a sad, bitter person \u2014 but also a persistent one.When I was nine, New York State required a physical fitness test, and at that age, each student was expected to be able to run a half-mile, which in the dead of the Upstate winter meant 18 laps around the gymnasium. After less than five numbing circuits, I knew I could go no further.But I could not quit. Too stubborn for that. No one can know I\u2019m not normal. So I pressed on. I was not okay, but I could never admit that. Not to kids who were far more okay than I ever would be.As I completed my last, painfully-slow trek as fast as my little legs and littler lungs could carry me, I laid myself out at the finish. There were cheers and snickers for the wheezing weakling who took 17 fucking minutes to run the length of seven football fields.Within mere seconds, I was rushed to the nurse\u2019s office and they called my mom, and she looked at me and, as she often asked in those days, asked me, \u201cDo you want to die?\u201d I never answered her honestly. Hell, I\u2019m still not sure of the answer.I would occasionally play out in the snow, and come in from the bitter cold to breathe into this spaceship thing for 20 minutes and then show back up trying to explain away inquisitive queries from comrades, \u201cHey, man. Where\u2019d you go?\u201dWhen I was in 9th grade, New York State required another physical fitness test, and at that age, each student was expected to be able to run a full mile, which at the height of allergy season meant four long laps around a stone track. By this time, my lack of endurance was no longer a secret. Concerned friends asked before we began, \u201cYou gonna make it?\u201dPfffffft \u2026 yeah \u2026 nothing to it, right?I refused to walk. I refused to quit. Quitting is weak. An admission of abnormality. And I watched with horror as I was passed by the morbidly obese, by the pencil-pushers who\u2019ve never moved faster than a walk, by the kid with that gimp because one leg is like four inches longer than the other, by the kids even the bullies felt were too weak to beat up. How were they doing this? Why couldn\u2019t I?By the time I crossed the finish line, I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t even moan. 18 minutes. Many could\u2019ve walked faster. A few of them did. I made the lonely, wobbly trek up to the nurse\u2019s office and there, waiting for me, was that spaceship-looking piece all cued up and ready for me to lock lips with it and regain what I\u2019d lost. Well, the oxygen part of what I lost, anyway. My dignity had long since abandoned me.Pick-up games of football were awesome when you sat yourself out on first and second down to avoid over-exertion. Another favorite pasttime of mine was staring longingly out the windows of a warm cabin at the snowball fights my friends would host on camping trips. Birthday parties where I needed to hide in the bathroom in self-imposed timeout with only an inhaler and my tears to keep me company were a welcome reprieve, as well.You would never guess by looking at me or listening to me, but there was a time when I used to be a pretty decent soccer player. And I knew as long as I could conserve my energy and get off the field when tired, I could make a welcome contribution to the team. I did precisely that for 12 years of my life. I even tried my hand at baseball and basketball, too, with mixed-to-mediocre results.Yet, soccer was my passion \u2014 the one sport I knew I could beat anyone at so long as I wasn\u2019t too tired to try. And so in high school, I finally did try \u2026 try out, that is. And, as the first informational meeting was held in the school cafeteria, and the coach handed out an off-season training regiment, I noticed a glaring obstacle that needed to be overcome: Homework. In the form of running. Not just up and down a field. But real, distance, \u201cgo real far down the road and don\u2019t come back\u201d running. As in miles.Needless to say, I never did my homework. Or, I should say, I never completed an assignment. A half-mile was all I could stomach before I needed to turn around and walk back, puffing on an inhaler the whole way. Wallowing in defeat, one puff at a time. And forget cross-training with swimming. I\u2019d rather be forced to run gassers in the gym for an hour than swim across open water for even 30 seconds.As I made my way to our first practice in the fall, I knew I was at a significant disadvantage with my whole default programming of \u201cyou guys go on without me I need to sit here and stare at the flowers\u201d thing, so I did the only thing I could: I tried to beat everyone in every distance run \u2014 even if they were just warm-ups. I think one time I came in 4th out of 26, but I usually finished in the back of the pack before sucking down Albuterol like it was Gatorade. My teammates called me \u201cgimpy.\u201d It\u2019s hard out here for a gimp.The coaches dug my intensity. They dug my commitment. They dug my ball skills and my field vision. I made the team. I played short, abbreviated shifts at center midfielder, because of course you put the kid who can\u2019t run at the position that requires the most running. Two 5-minute shifts each half, and then a crunch-time shift. I scored goals. I notched points. But not enough to stop our team from finishing 3\u201310\u20133 and dead last in our division. Maybe if I could have played more, we might have had a winning record. Or maybe if I was European. Or had both lungs. Whatever was more probable.I was hooked on high school soccer, and I\u2019d always been, but I knew I was going to need to up my endurance. I was going to need to learn to run.That spring, the kid who couldn\u2019t run signed up for the track team. I listed my specialty events as the 100m, 200m and Long Jump. Because, well, running farther for any reason except from the cops is wholly unnecessary.My first practice, we ran 2 miles as a warm-up. I finished dead last. I finished dead last in a lot of things in practice \u2026 but I surprised some folks, too.One time, as a joke, the track coach let me anchor a 4x400m relay for my team and go head-to-head against our fastest 400m runner on the other team, and the first three cats on my relay squad were so good ahead of me that I was spotted a 100m headstart. When I got the baton, I ran as fast as humanly possible, to the delight and awe of everyone on the team. I remember the cheers as I came down the home stretch, the long-legged gazelle-like athletic freak behind me gaining on me with every step. I kept telling myself I would not be beaten. I could not be beaten. And I sure as shit don\u2019t quit. I ain\u2019t weak.As he passed me with just a couple short steps remaining, I could feel my rage boiling. THIS IS NOT FAIR. I AM TRYING HARDER THAN YOU. So I gave him a nudge and dove for the finish, arm outstretched, holding the baton. I had won, if you consider running a quarter-mile in 90 seconds to beat another chap who ran it at a 5-minute mile pace \u2014 and oh-by-the-way disqualifying yourself because you reached into the other lane with your elbow \u2014 a victory. I did anyway. I broke the tape \u2014 and in life, breaking the tape is all that matters.I earned a shit-ton of respect that day, even if it was mock respect, and I used that as leverage to propel me forward. My team cheered and gave me this bizarre nickname \u201cSweetness\u201d from that point on. I\u2019m not certain what it meant, and I\u2019m not sure that I want to. I hope it\u2019s in tribute to Walter Payton. I\u2019m more certain it\u2019s derogatory.I gave my all every practice, every meet. I even medaled in the 200m and Long Jump on rare occasion. I knew if my lungs were going to fail me, my mind and legs would not. But yet, I knew if I were ever going to shake my stigma of my sick-as-fuck respiratory system, I was going to need to do something completely unexpected. Something grandiose. Something furiously, devilishly impossible for a man like me.In Utica, New York, where I went to high school, there\u2019s this 15K (9.3 miles for you metrically-impaired) road race they host every year called The Boilermaker. It\u2019s hilly and hellish and held in the heat of July.I had watched my dad run it from the comforts of a water station outside his place of employment, and to me it always seemed like a pipe-dream. But I saw the way the community rallied around each and every runner, from the Kenyans who scorched it to the last stragglers who don\u2019t know the finish line closed hours ago. I signed the fuck up.I remember my friends telling me, as I prepped myself to lace them up, \u201cGood Luck.\u201d I remember trembling in fear at the start line. I remember starting in last \u2014 on purpose \u2014 so that I could say that I passed everyone who finished behind me.As the gun went off, I knew I was in trouble. Those cop cars that follow the final runners never quite left my sight for the first third of the race. 40 minutes through 5k. I picked up the pace on the downhill stretch and ran the second third in 30. Then, finally, the long, slow uphill battle through that last mile. I staggered and stumbled. I started to walk. My legs were numb, my lungs were on fire, my brain light-headed and woozy from the unprecedented torture I was inflicting upon my body.I wasn\u2019t going out like this. As I saw the finish line, I sprinted to the end. The clock is my enemy, the tape is my friend. Upon finishing, I was immediately helped concerned care-takers rush me into the medical tent, where I hooked my battered body up to a \u201cMachine\u201d and an IV.Dehydrated, exhausted, gasping for oxygen, I lay on a cot where my dad, who finished a full half-hour before me, came upon his son: red in the face, blue in the lips yet glowing in unmistakable pride. 9.3 miles in 1 hour, 54 minutes, and 37 seconds. I finished in the bottom 10% of all runners. But I was still a winner \u2026 if only in my mind.When I told my mom I had finished, I can\u2019t remember how she took it. I\u2019d like to tell you she teared up that day, but in the spirit of allowing myself to paraphrase without allowing myself to exaggerate, I\u2019ll just remark that I either recall that she did, or that I wish that she did, and so I just made it so. She, more than likely, said nothing of note at all.Later that day, I was shipped up to the Adirondacks where I spent the next week hiking the five highest peaks in the Upstate mountain range, and did so with legs like jelly but an indomitable spirit. Altitude be damned. The kid who passed out running a mile two years ago, had just finished running 15000 meters worth of hilly road and hiking over 15000 meters of breathtaking mountain summits within the span of 12 hours. Even when you don\u2019t break the tape, you can still be victorious.\u201cThe Machine\u201d was retired in 2002, when I was prescribed a drug called Advair. The discus, a mixture of a corticosteroid and an anti-inflammatory agent, had greatly improved my quality of life.I once went five years without using a rescue inhaler. With it, I was able to continue running at little to no risk to my life and lungs. It is, put quite simply, the most effective medicine I\u2018d ever been prescribed for any physical or mental condition from which I\u2019ve ever suffered. Expensive? Sure, at $300 without insurance it\u2019s a financial catastrophe. A financial catastrophe that was worth every penny.I would run the Boilermaker race six more times, with a best finish of 90 minutes. I hiked up Humphrey\u2019s Peak, a 12,000 ft. mountain in Arizona, and Mt. Mitchell, the highest peak on the Eastern side of the Mississippi. In 2009, I biked 54 miles with my father, and in 2010, I biked 67 miles alone. Although I\u2019m not an extraordinary athlete, I can at least claim I\u2019m not about to die, and that\u2019s more of a victory to me than it probably should be.2016 marked my 30th anniversary of being diagnosed with Asthma. I celebrated with a cigar. Because why the fuck not. It\u2019s now 2019.This morning, I had my semi-annual lung function test at the pulmonary doctor\u2019s office, where they take a chest CT scan, run me through a variety of breathing exercises and listen with a stethoscope to determine just how gravely doomed I am and estimate how many years I\u2019ve left to live. The verdict? 2\u20135 years remained.The numbers from the tests, as expected, weren\u2019t great. Diagnosis: Asthma. A normal lung for a man my age can breathe out 3.64L of air (almost a gallon) in one second. I can breathe out 2.37L, about 65% of average, which is to say demonstrably terrible for a man my age \u2014 if I was over 40, they\u2019d check me for COPD \u2014 but this was about right in line with my normal. My lung age is in the late-70s.Between three and six seconds of a forced exhale, the average man my age can breathe out another 3.96L of air. I can breathe out 1.30L. That\u2019s 32% of average, and if I was over 40 and smoked three packs a day, you would swear I have emphysema. I do not. I simply don\u2019t have it in me.Sure, scary for most humans, but standard for me. If I were older, you\u2019d tell me I had a couple good years left and dope me up with a long-term cocktail of steroids, oxygen tanks and the shit they peddle in those commercials with the elephant to keep me alive as long as humanly possible.That\u2019s the bad news. That\u2019s the news I haven\u2019t stopped receiving since before I knew how to spell \u201cnews.\u201dThe good news, as always, comes from the CT scan. The doctor told me that my lungs, aside from the smallest of airways, are perfectly clear. Not inflamed. Not constricted. Not scarred. Not obstructed. No bronchial thickening or allergic sinusitis. Nothing. It is the first time in my life (I think), and in the seven years in particular since I started seeing lung doctors, that I had been given the seal of approval: \u201cHey, man. It may never get better \u2026 but probably won\u2019t get worse until you\u2019re much, much older.\u201dImagine: your lungs like an upside-down tree. Your trachea is the trunk, your bronchial tubes are the big branches, your bronchi are the smaller branches, and they keep deviating out from that until you get to the leaves \u2014 which are the air sacs. My Asthma is almost 100% contained within the twigs. My leaves are green and lush (my Oxygen concentration is at 98\u201399%, which is normal, and, also, this means I, again, do not have emphysema) and the branches are all healthy and thriving.And there is more good news. My Asthmatic coughing has subsided and been replaced by the more subtle weak cough caused by laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, caused by the inhaled corticosteroids that I use to keep the Asthma at bay. It\u2019s caused by stomach acid leaking into the top of the trachea. This is far less serious.I have no wheezing. I haven\u2019t had an honest-to-god Asthma attack \u2014 I should asterisk this with a bold when I have been able to afford my medicine and take it regularly, ahem, summer of 2012 \u2014 since 2002. I have Advair (2002\u20132014) and Symbicort (2014-present) to thank for that. The attacks I have are so mild and short-lived that they do not even require me using Albuterol, which is just one of the many drugs I\u2019ve taken to beat my Asthma back. Maybe tens of thousands of puffs in my lifetime.The small airways are where Symbicort has its limits. The particles are too large to reach into the small airways. Imagine trying to shove an African Elephant into your bathroom. And so that\u2019s where the fire still burns. This manifests itself in me getting winded walking up stairs, or doing more than 15 seconds of CrossFit, or bending over to tie my shoes (my spare tire around my waist doesn\u2019t help with that, either).But the fire is contained. A controlled burn. One that my doctor seems totally convinced I can live with for reasons I\u2019ll get into later.Dymista, my nasal spray, has essentially eliminated my allergies \u2014 aside from shots of Fireball, which made me sneeze uncontrollably for three minutes. And that\u2019s when I quit Fireball. Not because of asthma, but because I\u2019m not fucking 24 anymore.Singulair (which is a pill and so I often forget to take it) has been a long run\u2019s best friend \u2014 it keeps my small airways open juuuuuuust enough to keep me from running out of breath (too quickly) but not enough to notice in day-to-day life.So. About that running \u2026 there is no doubt running has helped bring me back from the brink. Since 2014, I\u2019ve run 13 (!!!) half-marathons, a 10-mile race, and five 10Ks. I\u2019ve also biked 50 miles twice \u2026 yet those are just the races.All that has done something magical \u2014 it has taken my lung capacity to new heights. In October 2012, my IC (the sum of the amount of air I can breathe in and out and the amount of air trapped in my small airways) was 72% of normal. In October 2019, it stands at 105%.I can breathe out, in sum total, a 100% normal amount of air. It takes me a while \u2014 again, because of my small airways \u2014 but it gets out there. Because I run, I have lung capacity, which allows me to run farther, which allows me to breathe more air in and out. My lungs are not perfect, but they\u2019re operating \u2014 knock on wood and\/or lung tissue \u2014 perfectly normally \u2026 at least by my standards.And, you know what else has helped? Singing. Anyone who has heard me sing knows how loud, how long, and how intense I can hold a note. There isn\u2019t a soul alive with (air-quotes) \u201cmy lungs\u201d who could be able to do all that if the air wasn\u2019t there. The basic numbers say it isn\u2019t possible. But now we know it is.There are some medicines I can take that will dig deeper into my lungs and destroy the fire in the small airways \u2014 there\u2019s prednisone (not optimal long-term because holy god the side-effects like bone atrophy and organ failure), I could take a crazy dose of singulair (not recommended because of drowsiness), or I could try new drugs just released from U.S. clinical trials like Qvar or Alvesco. But I don\u2019t need to.In seven years, my small airways haven\u2019t gotten any worse. And there are new drugs in clinical trials that could be the magic bullet to fix the entire airway \u2014 not just the big and medium stuff. The hope is out there that in short bursts my lungs could function like a normal pair. Maybe. If not, well \u2026 who knows.This past Sunday, I ran 13 miles. Again. For a race. To prepare for a marathon. My second. My immunologist thinks I\u2019m fucking insane.\u201cWith the numbers you have on this paper, you should be hyperventilating, and taking your rescue inhaler six times a day, and in the ER all the time.\u201d He paused. \u201cThese numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story.\u201dThey don\u2019t. Because since I started running long distances in 2014, my resting heart rate dropped 31 BPM. I\u2019ve lost 45 pounds. And my lungs \u2014 well, most of them, anyway \u2014 have opened up. They\u2019re not losing steam at inopportune times. They\u2019re not degenerating. They\u2019re healthy-ish. They\u2019re (am I jinxing myself here?) normal-ish.Who knows where I\u2019ll be later in life. Could my asthma \u2014 now finally beaten to a hapless shell of its former self with a cocktail of nasal sprays and inhaled steroids and intense cardio endurance training \u2014 have finally lost the war its been fighting so well for so long?It\u2019s too tantalizing to think. And, well, wrong. I found out not long ago I have an IgG deficiency. I don\u2019t make enough of an antibody to guard against respiratory infections. As it turns out, it wasn\u2019t exercise or allergies that ruined my lungs \u2026 I\u2019ve had a low-grade lower-respiratory infection in my small airways my entire life, and it\u2019s never gone away.But I\u2019m breathing. And as long as I can do that, well, I\u2019m going to keep fighting the good fight.On Christmas in 2007, my mom bought me what should have been a gag gift, but for me it meant so much more. She bought me a stuffed bear. I know, haha, a 25 year-old opening up a present on Christmas and finding a plush toy. But as I looked at the blue and gold tag, it read the following:\u201cThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America has certified this toy \u2018Asthma Friendly\u2019, manufactured from materials that will not accumulate high levels of household allergens known to cause Asthma.\u201dFor a man who remembers the day when his Mt. Olympus of stuffed bears was taken from him for fear of causing late-night ER visits, the gesture was more than appreciated, it was adored. It is, to this day, the sweetest gift anyone has ever bought me, even if I am in fact far too old to properly appreciate a stuffed bear.But my kid \u2014 should someone ever feel compelled to think my genes are worth passing on to their kid, too \u2014 is going to love cuddling up to it at night \u2026 even if the tyke turns out just as asthmatic as the father did.I look forward to one day telling my child (should I actually have one) everything you just read above and more; a series of bedtime stories that I hope one day inspires the little one to follow the dreams that will await her during her nightly slumber.And when you \u2014 my as-yet-unknown future apple-of-my-eye \u2014 awakes from your bed, and you do, in fact, chase those dreams down, I hope you run as fast as your lungs will allow. I hope that you do, kid, because if you spend your life conserving your breath, you\u2019re going to miss all the milestone moments that will take your breath away.John Gorman.

But now I\u2019m beginning to get my feeling that maybe my body is a temple \u2014 an ancient ruin full of rotting ghosts and booby traps and beginning to fall apart with exposure to the elements.Obviously, my body has never been my friend. I\u2019ve been overweight since I was 12 months old or so, and by the time I was old enough to be in control of my body, I was a fat kid \u2014 basically, my weight was a runaway train, and I had no way in hell of stopping it.But just when I think that I\u2019m finally getting a handle on things \u2014 clearing the clutter out of some of the excess rooms, if you catch my drift \u2014 the entire basement collapses into the ground.My legs. My legs are a fucking disaster zone.I\u2019ve been losing a great deal of weight over the last 5 months or so (over 100 pounds now!) but about a month or two ago, I started to get worse swelling in my right leg, and open wounds that wouldn\u2019t close. I\u2019d had a cellulitis infection earlier in the year, and that had healed up okay. But all of a sudden, my foot had swollen so large that I couldn\u2019t fit it into my shoe, and my leg so large that I couldn\u2019t fit my legs into the driver\u2019s side of the car.It\u2019s also become rock solid \u2014 where I used to have pitting edema, now my leg is so hard that the skin doesn\u2019t pit at all.And, what\u2019s worse, it\u2019s like the fat in the lower area of my thigh has solidified into a hard lump from it\u2019s usual jiggly self. And that process is beginning on my left thigh, too.Only in the last few weeks, I started to have problems in my left leg \u2014 with that buckshot pattern of spots, that turned into pustules, and then the open scabs. And now I\u2019m starting to have some swelling in my foot, too. Right on the top of my foot, the same as on my right foot.And I\u2019ve been to the ER, and I\u2019ve done the merry-go-round of taking antibiotics, seeing my GP, going to the wound care specialist, and none of it seems to be getting better.Their advice, of course, is for me to lose weight. Which I was already doing, keep in mind.Most of them won\u2019t even look at me when I\u2019m talking. When Shaunta is with me, they talk to her and not me most of the time.Meanwhile, I\u2019m in pain and losing my mobility, more and more by the day, it seems.This temple is falling apart.I thought that was the kind of thing that was supposed to happen gradually as you got older: during your 30s, you start to get tired and have aches and pains, more and more through your 40s and 50s, until you start having big problems, need new hips, maybe a kidney transplant or some kind of surgery, until the major systems start failing in your 70s-80s.Instead, my body is collapsing under me. A little too literally for comfort.All I can do for now is keep shouting. Keep trying to get my doctors to listen to me. See if somebody\u2019s willing to look beyond the distracting fatness and get to the heart of the problem.Obviously, I shouldn\u2019t hold my breath.And it\u2019s frustrating: I want to get better. I was getting better. I was looking forward to losing that weight, to being able to walk more, to get out and about, to maybe even get in an airplane and travel again, to being able to wander through a city.Obviously, I was never going to be able to run a marathon, but I at least wanted to be able to go out and walk without it killing me.And just as I started to reclaim my body, this shit started.Man, I\u2019m tired.Zach J.

I can\u2019t remember the first time I heard the term \u201cbeer belly,\u201d but I immediately knew what it meant.In recent years, however, several reports have come out that look at our chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or diabetes \u2014 some of the most deadly diseases for Americans \u2014 and found a disturbing connection between these diseases and beer bellies.What makes someone\u2019s belly a \u201cbeer belly\u201d? But more importantly, why is it worse to have a beer belly than it is to carry fat in other areas, when it comes to these diseases?Beer belly, spare tire, beer gut \u2014 there are plenty of names for excess fat that many people, men especially, tend to carry around the waist.The simple reason why we put on weight is well understood; excess calories (eating more than we burn for energy) are stored as fat. The distribution of fat on our bodies, however, varies person to person.The majority of our fat is stored in one or more of a few places: butt, hips, thighs, or around the abdomen.Fat allocation \u2014 that is, which area is used for storing these excess calories \u2014 depends on several different factors. The majority of weight distribution is determined by genetics, with roughly 50% of fat distribution controlled through heredity. Sex also has an impact, where men tend to carry more fat around the waist, while women tend to carry more fat in the hips and thighs. Age and hormones also have an impact, where increased age and reduced hormone levels tend to cause more weight to be carried around the abdomen.Fat comes in three different types, depending largely on where it\u2019s located on our bodies:These different types of fat are linked to different health outcomes in our bodies.If you\u2019re looking down at your stomach right now and wondering what kind of fat you\u2019ve got, it\u2019s pretty easy to figure it out.Just give it a poke.Because subcutaneous fat is above the muscle layer, just under the skin, it is soft and squishy when prodded. This is why we can pinch the arms and legs of a chubby baby*; that fat is all subcutaneous. A squishy belly indicates the presence of subcutaneous fat.If a belly is distended (extended out, not flat), but is hard when prodded, however, that means that the fat is visceral \u2014 it\u2019s below the muscle layer, so when you poke your belly, you hit the hard abdominal muscles that are stretched over the fat beneath.It\u2019s this second type, the hard belly indicating visceral fat, that can spell potential trouble from a health perspective. Visceral fat is the type of fat that\u2019s associated with a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Visceral fat is converted easily into cholesterol, which can lead to arterial blockages and heart attacks at high levels. It also releases pro-inflammatory chemicals, which can overwork our immune system and may lead to a higher risk of developing type II diabetes.Fortunately, there are two pieces of good news:First, a small amount of visceral fat is not the end of the world, although it\u2019s still not ideal. These fat deposits help to cushion our organs and keep them from bumping into each other \u2014 although in today\u2019s sedentary world, there\u2019s less need for this cushioning than there might have been in the past.Second, visceral fat is the easiest to lose \u2014 when your body begins burning fat, visceral fat is the first choice. It\u2019s easier to access than the subcutaneous fat, so it\u2019s the first to be consumed when on a diet or when exercising.One important note: it\u2019s the level of exercise, not the type of exercise, that matters. Even though it seems logical that crunches would target belly fat, this isn\u2019t the case. When our bodies burn off fat, they choose fat from all visceral areas, and then from all subcutaneous areas \u2014 no matter what the exercise is. The type of exercise has no impact on which fat deposit the body chooses to burn!Therefore, for anyone trying to get rid of visceral fat, whole-body exercises are generally more effective than targeted exercises. Swimming, running, hiking, or rowing are all good choices.And in the end, remember that no one can outrun their fork. The best weapon against visceral fat is a diet with fewer total calories, especially cutting down on rapidly absorbed high-glycemic-index items like processed carbohydrates.*Please note: only pinch babies if you\u2019ve received permission from the infant\u2019s mother or father.Sam Westreich holds his PhD in genetics, focusing on methods for studying the gut-associated microbiome.

People \u2014 rightfully so \u2014 don\u2019t want to eat things they hate, so they figure that it\u2019s better to be overweight and happy than fit and miserable.It\u2019s easy to buy into the celebrity\/pro bodybuilder diets that are published in health & fitness magazines every month and think that this is the one and only key to a six pack. There is no middle ground: it\u2019s either a grease bomb from the Drive Thru or eating out of cold Tupperware for every meal.I\u2019m here to tell you that\u2019s not the case. You\u2019ve got options, and you can eat foods that you like while getting lean in the process.For example: My breakfast this morning was a massive pancake topped with whipped cream, syrup, walnuts and cinnamon.That\u2019s my breakfast most days.Doesn\u2019t sound like the mundane \u201cplain oatmeal with a glass of skim milk\u201d you were expecting, right?That\u2019s because of what the pancakes are made with, and how much I\u2019m actually eating.My pancake\/waffle mix of choice is a brand called Kodiak Cakes. It\u2019s a high protein, high fiber, whole grain pancake mix. One serving is 190 calories; 14g of protein, 4g of fat and 28g of carbs. I have two servings most mornings.It\u2019s topped with one serving of sugar free syrup and two servings of whipped cream. Both weigh in at 15 calories per serving, making for a total of 45 extra calories.Are 45 extra calories something I need to be worried about if I\u2019m not trying to go from 6% bodyfat to 5%? No.Can I consume those 45 calories every day and maintain a lean, athletic physique? Yes.Do they make this meal absolutely delicious and something I look forward to almost every single morning? Also yes.I like to top the meal off with a serving of walnuts to add some good fats (190 cal\/serving) and a pinch of cinnamon, which is researched to have numerous metabolic health benefits. Again, that\u2019s cinnamon \u2014 not cinnamon sugar.So for a very satisfying, delicious, nutritious breakfast, you\u2019re looking at a grand total of..\u2026 Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 by sharing those numbers, I\u2019m not saying you should be pulling out a calculator to figure out the calorie content of every single meal you eat. In fact, you can absolutely maintain a low body fat percentage year \u2018round without overly obsessing over calories.I\u2019m showing you those numbers to give you something to compare to another set of numbers \u2014 numbers that will paint a very clear picture of just how easy it is to overeat without even being conscious of it.Compare the meal I laid out above with the type of pancakes you\u2019d be getting if you decided to opt for the \u201cconvenience\u201d of the drive thru:(Numbers taken from a real fast food franchise\u2019s nutrition facts)* Two servings of pancakes: 660 calories* One serving of syrup: 190 calories* Total calories: 850 calories; 158 carbs, 16 grams of fat, and 18 grams of protein... And since most fast food chains don\u2019t typically have the other foods I top my pancakes off with readily available, these numbers are assuming that you JUST ordered two servings of pancakes with syrup by themselves. No butter, no beverage, no sausage, no eggs; no other \u201cstaple\u201d on the traditional chain restaurant breakfast plate.By the time you\u2019ve added any additional sides and\/or beverages, it\u2019s quite easy to see how this can turn into a 1,000+ calorie meal.And that\u2019s just breakfast. If you consider how quickly a full day of eating could add up \u2014 in either direction \u2014 based on the decisions you made for lunch and dinner, it\u2019s easy to see how chronic overeating is a silent killer among us.I make this simple pancake comparison to demonstrate that good food doesn\u2019t have to taste bad. You could apply the same logic to burgers, pizzas, tacos, and anything else your palate desires.Consider what it is you\u2019re putting on your plate every day at this moment and ask yourself what you could be doing to clean it up.Start small. Just start with a single meal and don\u2019t even worry about the rest of your day until you\u2019re ready. You don\u2019t develop habits overnight, and you don\u2019t break them overnight either. Simply being aware of what you\u2019re consuming on a daily basis is the most important first step you can take.Win the war against bad habits one good decision at a time.Thanks for reading!

The \u201cbest\u201d way? Well, as with most things in life, the answer to that is:It depends.There are three different ways most commonly utilized to elicit muscular hypertrophy. Depending on the individual, one method may be utilized more often than others \u2014 but all three should ideally have their place in your programming.1 set of 6 reps can look and feel drastically different depending on the amount of control you demonstrate over the weight. Let\u2019s use the barbell bench press as an example.Option #1 could be to dive bomb the weight down, bounce it off of your sternum, and rely on momentum & the stretch reflex to propel the weight back up. Depending on how heavy the load is, we\u2019ll assume it takes roughly 2 to 3 seconds per repetition performed in this sloppy, haphazard fashion. So a set of 6 would equal about 12\u201318 seconds total of work. This is neither advisable nor an effective muscle building tool. Especially if you don\u2019t particularly enjoy shoulder surgery.Option #2 would be to deliberately slow down the eccentric (lowering) phase of the lift for a count of 4 to 6 seconds before driving the weight back up to the starting position. This change in tempo has taken us from about 12\u201318 seconds of work in example #1 to about 36\u201350 seconds of work done in this example (4\u20136 seconds down, 1 second up, 0\u20131 seconds at the top of the movement between reps).These slow eccentrics much more effectively elicit the micro tears (muscular damage) to the muscle that will be repaired during the recovery process \u2014 bigger and stronger than before.Another pleasant side effect of training in this fashion is that slowing down the eccentric will teach mastery of the exercise throughout its full range of motion much more quickly than relying on momentum and compensations from other muscle groups to do the job for you.Of the methods discussed here, this one is the most \u201cjoint friendly\u201d of the three. Metabolic stress is the accumulation of metabolites in muscle cells as the target muscles become engorged with blood throughout the duration of the set.Time under tension is the name of the game when it comes to training for metabolic stress. More commonly known as \u201cthe pump\u201d, the amount of work done per set can fall anywhere between the 15 to 30 rep range, and the actual amount of weight used is less important than focusing on contracting the target muscles as hard as possible with each repetition, driving as much blood into the area of focus as possible.Training in this fashion is useful for understanding how to \u201cget inside\u201d your muscles by developing a mind-muscle connection.It\u2019s also a great tool for training around an injury. If you\u2019re banged up you can make \u201clight weights feel heavy\u201d by flipping the conventional \u201calways perform your heaviest sets first\u201d methodology on its head and pre-exhausting your muscles with more high rep, isolation movements before moving on to the big, compound lifts.For example, somebody recovering from a shoulder injury that wants to train the barbell bench press could perform 2\u20133 sets of 15\u201320 reps of triceps push downs, followed 2\u20133 more sets of 15\u201320 reps of light dumbbell bench presses, before finally moving onto their heavier barbell movement. This \u201cpre fatiguing\u201d strategy will:Both benefits will contribute to a more joint friendly strength training session while minimizing the chances of injury.Thirdly, this is the type of hypertrophy elicited from moving seriously challenging weights \u2014\u200afor example, a heavy set of 3 barbell squats with 85% of your 1-rep max.Unlike metabolic stress, mechanical tension is derived predominantly from heavy, shorter duration, high intensity sets that require the utmost concentration to maintain immaculate form.\u201c Mechanical tension is the force you place on your muscles under when you contract them against resistance. Muscles have receptors called mechanosensors that sense how much force the muscle is under and the length of time it sustains that tension. Once these sensors detect tension, it sets off a cascade of chemical reactions that ultimately cause the muscle to grow.\u201d \u2014 Cathe Friedrich, cathe.comPerforming this style of strength training promotes neurological efficiency \u2014 that is, your central nervous system becomes accustomed to handling near maximal loads.A more efficient muscle is a stronger muscle. Stronger muscles will enable you to handle overall heavier weights throughout all modalities of training \u2014 be it muscular damage, metabolic stress, or mechanical tension.An ideal strength & conditioning program would take all three of these methods into consideration. Individual needs, of course, will greatly vary \u2014 an aesthetic driven bodybuilder will certainly be more concerned with chasing the pump via metabolic training than will the powerlifter who spends more of their time in the 1\u20135 rep range.But that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t all have their place in a well balanced program.One commonality shared between all three styles of training should be the pursuit of progressive overload.Rather that be 5 more pounds, 1 extra rep, a more challenging variation, or any of the other countless ways to advance an exercise \u2014 over time, the goal should always be to progress.Dr. Brad Schoenfeld is a top researcher in muscular hypertrophy. This article was inspired by his work from a study published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning titled \u201cThe Mechanisms of Muscle Hypertrophy and Their Application to Resistance Training\u201d.Thanks for reading!

How can you make a really crappy decision and then turn around and get married again thinking it\u2019s going to work out this time?One time I didn\u2019t buy a $20 trash can because I thought I wouldn\u2019t actually need it that much.I feel like I live in a dream world where it\u2019s just a matter of time before what I wanted 3 months ago turns into something else. This makes living life incredibly frustrating because I can never muster the energy to chase anything anymore.Will it just be a waste of my time?A study posed to 3,700+ adults in America asked participants to predict their life satisfaction in the future. Ten years later, the researchers came back to see whether participants were actually as satisfied as they thought they would be.48 percent of participants overestimated their life satisfaction, while 22 percent underestimated it.This just in: humans are terrible at predicting how their current actions will impact their happiness later.Another way to put it? What we want now is not what we want later. We\u2019re terrible decision-makers.How do we fix this?I have a running to-do list on my computer full of certain things that pop into my head. I write them all down so I don\u2019t forget, and I find that with 75% of them, I don\u2019t care about them any more a week later.They weren\u2019t as important as I thought.Oh, I was supposed to hop on a call with so-and-so? Ehh, I realize now that doesn\u2019t have to happen, or I realize I don\u2019t want it.Nothing will suffocate what we don\u2019t want like time.Write what you want down, then revisit it a week later to see if it\u2019s actually what you want.When I created my first online course, I didn\u2019t make a single lesson before selling it.I sold it first to see whether people would actually buy, and then when they bought it, I made the lessons.I think the same principles can be applied to anyone chronically suffering from decision remorse. Aren\u2019t sure whether you want to get married? Maybe live with that person for a few months and see what it\u2019s like.I\u2019m currently struggling to figure out whether I should start streaming video games. Before I buy a $2,000 setup to start streaming, I might want to try streaming on somebody else\u2019s rig once or twice before I go full-blown Ninja on everybody.Maybe I won\u2019t like streaming as much as I thought. Maybe my audience now won\u2019t give much of a darn that I\u2019m streaming.I can figure that out before making a huge life-changing decision by dipping my toe in the water first.Tough. You may very well be stuck now. Pretty much everything in life can be corrected, but maybe you have hope things will work out.Just wait and see if they will.Also, just remember that everything in life teaches us something. For instance, lately, I\u2019ve realized I don\u2019t want to keep vlogging that much. After gaining close to 500,000 followers on Facebook and Youtube, I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t want to actually make daily vlogs like Casey Neistat anymore.What I actually want is to make statement videos. I want to sit in front of the camera and talk to it and then have someone else edit it and publish it.I\u2019ve gained a lot along the way. I\u2019ve gained followers, friends, a bomb ass camera, free trips, money, and I\u2019ve gotten to be creative. It has hardly been a waste of my time, however now I\u2019m realizing that I want to write more than anything else.That streetcar named desire struck me again. The flashy new object. Sometimes we jump on the streetcar and it leads us to places we never wanted to go. If it does, just try to enjoy certain parts of the ride and learn from it.I want you to take away one thing from this article.Be careful of your desire. It will trick you. Give it time and dip your toe in the water before making rash decisions.

But after years of steering clear of it, I \u201cstepped up to the bar\u201d and gave deadlifting a try.At first, I didn\u2019t go beyond the 225 pound range until that felt easy. Then I threw a 25 pound plate on each side.After a couple of weeks, that felt pretty easy too. That led to swapping out the 25 pounder for another 45 pound plate.That felt easy too.As the weight continued to shoot up, so did my confidence. Within a year, I pulled 425 pounds. While that\u2019s not \u201ca lot\u201d by many people\u2019s standards, for me, at that point in time, it felt like the coolest thing I had ever done.Every week I looked forward to my deadlifting sessions with gusto. My goal was to pull 500 pounds by Christmas of that year. But once I hit that 425 pound mark, the weight just stopped increasing the way it had been \u2014 seemingly weekly \u2014 over the past several months. (see: newbie gains 101).This is where experience proves to be an invaluable, yet cruel teacher.On this particular week, my deadlift day fell on a Tuesday. I benched heavy on Saturday and squatted heavy on Sunday, so seeing as I made it this far without an injury to speak of, I figured my magical Wolverine healing powers only needed a day to make me recovered enough to pull some heavy deadlifts by Tuesday.Except on Tuesday I woke up feeling like I had been run over by a bus. My joints ached, I felt generally weak, and I was still yawning after two cups of coffee.Nevertheless, I persisted. The program said \u201cTuesday \u2014 deadlifts\u201d and by golly, that\u2019s what it was going to be.135 pounds felt weak. My grip felt \u201cdisconnected\u201d from the bar, I was tight and beat up from the previous workouts, but I \u201csucked it up\u201d and moved onto 225 anyway.That felt even worse.So naturally, the only logical next move to make was to throw on 315. Because you can\u2019t move up in weight unless it\u2019s in 45 pound plate increments. That\u2019s just basic bro math.Rep #1 felt weaker and less stable than the first time I ever tried to pull it as a novice deadlifter. \u201cThe first one is always the hardest\u201d I thought \u2014 now that I got the initial pull out of the way, it should be easy to rely on the stretch reflex in my hamstrings to help me bounce the weight back up for at least 5 or 6 more reps.So I lowered the bar back down for my second rep. I made it to about mid shin level \u2026\u2026 and suddenly felt like somebody just smashed my lower back in with an aluminum baseball bat.I, along with the weight, crashed to the floor. I had NEVER before (and have never since) experienced such excruciating pain in the gym \u2014 or any physical activity, for that matter.I was fortunate \u2014 VERY fortunate to not have done any serious, long term damage. After a few weeks of having to roll around on the floor like an upside down turtle to put my socks on, the pain subsided. I considered it the most painful \u201cwarning shot\u201d my body has ever sent me.During this period of trying to get myself back to normal, I began to place a much larger emphasis on a few things. Stretching, PROPERLY warming up, and *really* listening to my body were among the top of that list.But perhaps the most important lesson that I learned from this close call with back surgery was that \u201cprogressive overload\u201d can and SHOULD be achieved many different ways other than just piling more weight onto the bar every week.\u201cThis principle involves continually increasing the demands on the musculoskeletal system to continually make gains in muscle size, strength, and endurance. Simply put, in order to get bigger and stronger, you must continually make your muscles work harder than they\u2019re used to.\u201d \u2014 Chris GouletSo, in a nutshell, your goal when you walk into the gym is to push yourself and your muscles harder than the last time you trained them.Adding weight to the bar is one way of doing that, but the problems begin when that\u2019s constantly the only thing you\u2019re doing to progress.Using my own mistake as an example, consider what I did wrong with the barbell deadlift. I got really strong (for me) in the lift, and once I hit my sticking point, I decided that I was going to keep pushing the weight higher no matter what it took \u2014 and it almost took my ability to deadlift at all.But what I could have done once I hit my plateau in weight was begin to implement other methods of progressive resistance.Below are three examples of how I could have done it back then, and how I\u2019m now doing it today.A great alternative to the traditional barbell bench, squat and deadlift would be the unilateral alternatives \u2014 such as the single arm floor press, the Bulgarian split squat, and the single leg Romanian Deadlift. And there are multiple benefits to incorporating them into your program.For one, when performing a unilateral exercise, you will be forced to develop greater core stability in order to balance the weight on one side of the body. Greater core strength means greater strength all around \u2014 so once you do revert back to the standard bench, squat and deadlift, you\u2019ll likely find yourself handling more weight than you could before.Unilateral movements are also overall less taxing on your central nervous system, so cycling in these variations in place of their bilateral counterparts will help to prevent you from becoming chronically overtrained (like I clearly was).Cycle these in for 3\u20134 weeks at a time and strive to get progressively stronger on them every week. Use weeks 1 & 2 to allow your body to learn the fundamental movement pattern of the exercises; use week 3 to push yourself on the exercises once you\u2019re comfortable doing them; on week 4, go all out and try to beat your own personal best performance from the week prior.And then cycle in a different form of progressive overload \u2014 that can be as simple as changing the exercise from a single legged goblet squat to a single legged squat holding a dumbbell in each hand and repeating the same 4 week process over again. You\u2019re still progressing, still getting stronger in a variety of exercises, and building a more well rounded, comprehensive strength profile all together.Let\u2019s face facts; for the vast majority of us, piling on extra weight makes us feel strong and \u201ccool\u201d \u2014 so much so that we will often sacrifice immaculate form for an extra 20 pounds on the bar. Utilizing paused repetitions is a surefire way to force your ego to be checked at the door, because not only will they demand you to exert a high level of control over the exercise, but you will be forced to drop the weight to a manageable level.Figure out how much weight you\u2019re currently working with on your main compound movements. Subtract 20\u201330% from those lifts and perform all of your sets of those exercises with a 2\u20133 second pause at the bottom of the lift.For example: If you\u2019re somebody that squats 225 pounds for 3 sets of 10 reps and speeds through those 10 reps as fast as humanly possible, compromising form and adequate depth in the process, give this a try:225\u201330%=157.5 pounds. Round up or down to the nearest 5 pounds and now perform your usual 3 sets of 10 with that weight \u2014 except at the bottom of every repetition, pause and hold yourself in that position for a count of 1 to 3 seconds before driving yourself back up.You will be humbled.But more importantly, you will get legitimately stronger, and the amount of weight you\u2019re able to push (and the mastery of technique you\u2019ll have over it) once you work your way back up will be leaps and bounds above what you could handle before if you\u2019ve never before trained in this fashion.You could cycle in paused repetitions for 3 weeks at a time. Week 1, take a 1 second pause; week 2, a 2 second pause; week 3, a 3 second pause. On the 4th week, go back to performing the movements with no pause \u2014 while maintaining good form \u2014 and you will be amazed at how much lighter that heavy weight used to feel.If you\u2019re someone that lives in the 6\u20138 rep range and never has a set that lasts more than 20 seconds total, overhauling the set\/rep scheme in general can not only provide some nice variety via an unfamiliar stimulus to your body, but it can also serve as a much needed break for your joints by dropping the weight and focusing more on the length of the set rather than the number of pounds you\u2019re using.A great way to progressively overload this style of training is to not be concerned with the number of actual reps you\u2019re completing with every set, but every week increase the amount of time you\u2019re spending performing the exercises.For example, a 3 week progression could see you performing all of your sets for 30 second intervals during week 1, 35 second intervals on week 2, and finally ramping up to 40 second intervals on week 3. A sample workout could look like this:This is just one example of many sets\/reps\/exercises you could progress, but it is worth noting that when training in this fashion, I would err on the side of predominantly utilizing dumbbells and\/or machines. The risk to reward ratio of pushing yourself in this fashion on something like a barbell squat or bench press is too great, and your joints will be thanking you for the time off.I have personally utilized this system of training for a 4 week cycle in the past and when I did make my way back to the heavy weight, I found myself moving much more smoothly, with less little \u201caches and pains\u201d than before.No matter what your personal goals are, you\u2019re training for your health first and foremost. Progressing in all facets of your training will keep you coming back for more while keeping your body healthy and ready to perform at the highest level \u2014 for life.Written byWritten by","17307":"Somewhere around late October, my body decided to crap out.It was completely unexpected, considering that I had been doing so much better, health-wise. I\u2019d started my diet, 77 pounds in the two months prior, and was starting to honestly feel better.The water started sneaking up on me.I didn\u2019t notice until the day after my birthday, when I got in the car to drive to a doctor\u2019s appointment, in Erie \u2014 about a 90 minute drive. It was time for my monthly check-in with the bariatric surgeon, so it was an appointment I was motivated to get to. I got behind the wheel, and I noticed that my right leg couldn\u2019t reach the pedals right. There wasn\u2019t enough space.So I made sure that the seat was all the way back (it was), and I set off, anyway. I barely made it around the corner before I realized that I couldn\u2019t drive like this. My reaction times were off, my placement was off. It would be too easy to make a mistake that could get somebody hurt.So I went back home.But, what you have to understand is, my leg is always messed up.From the literal moment of my birth, my right leg has been . . . a problem. I was born with a club foot, and when I was fairly young (six months old, I think?) I had a surgery to correct it.Or, over-correct it, anyway.The one thing I do remember is, when I was in elementary school, seeing a podiatrist who told me and my mom that my right foot was, essentially a bag of bones.But it\u2019s not just the foot that\u2019s screwed up. The whole leg juts out at a weird angle. When I walk, it\u2019s not with my feet and knees parallel to each other. My right leg is offset at about a 60\u00b0 angle.I had a cellulitis infection earlier in the year \u2014 one that had sent me into the hospital, and one that basically rendered the entire surface of my right shin into an open wound, constantly draining fluid. And it was swollen.Over those months, it had been healing slowly, but I\u2019d gotten used to the status quo of dealing with that. I was able to drive. I was able to get around. I was living with it.Suddenly, and seemingly without provocation, the swelling was worse. Bad enough that it was hard for me to move around. And all of the wounds from earlier in the year were reopening on my leg.And I had new wounds on my left leg, strange little buckshot wounds that first started as spots, and then pustules, and then hard little scabs, within about a week.In the last year and a half, I\u2019ve become well-acquainted with the ER staff at the local hospital. It\u2019s not a happy relationship. As someone who had greatly enjoyed the domestic television fantasies of ER and Grey\u2019s Anatomy (both of which take place at prestigious medical institutions, I should add), becoming a frequent flier at a place the locals call a band-aid station left me feeling kind of frustrated.There\u2019s no Susan Lewis or Doc. McDreamy here, folks.They freaked out about my blood pressure, gave me some pills, wrapped my leg in gauze, and told me to see my doctor.Every doctor or nurse I saw freaked out about my blood pressure. And I get it. I\u2019m a very large person, and my blood pressure runs high. To the tune of 240\/110 if I let it go untreated.But during this entire time, I was on medication for my blood pressure. And it was still running dangerously high. Resulting in more hospital visits.But it seemed like there was a disconnect: while they were all worrying about my blood pressure \u2014 to the extent where I spent another few days in the hospital over it.Meanwhile, I was more worried about the fact that my legs were so swollen that I could barely walk, and that some days, I could barely move without catching my breath.One of my benchmarks for how well I feel is pretty simple. My bedroom is upstairs, so every night, I have to climb up.Before I started losing weight, I had to pause every few steps while climbing up. After I lost weight, I could make it up the stairs, more or less, without having to stop.And when the swelling started again? It was the same issue. Some days, I\u2019d only have to stop once while going up the stairs. Other days, I\u2019d have to stop after every few steps to catch my breath.And it seemed like everything the doctors tried to throw at the problem wasn\u2019t helping. Twice-weekly leg wrappings? Helped some, but not much. And, as soon as some of the swelling went down, the wraps would fall off, only for my legs to swell back up again.Over these months, my mobility went from \u201calready kind of crappy\u201d to \u201cbasically zero.\u201dI couldn\u2019t put on pants. I couldn\u2019t put on shoes. I could barely put on my sandals. I had trouble lifting my leg enough to get it into the passenger seat of the car. I had trouble lifting my leg over the side of the shower. There were times where my knee wouldn\u2019t bend from all the swelling in the leg.I couldn\u2019t walk. I couldn\u2019t drive. I was stuck at home. Honestly, there were days when it was just easier to stay in bed.It felt like a punishment, almost. I\u2019d done my diet, lost a considerable amount of weight, and this swelling felt like my body\u2019s retribution. Oh, you think you\u2019re going to make things better for yourself? I\u2019ll show you!And, even worse, I thought this was permanent. Everything the doctors were trying wasn\u2019t working. And it felt like it was getting worse and worse.I had a doctor\u2019s appointment with Jen, my primary care physician, on January 3rd. Talk about ringing in the new year, wrong.It was the new status quo: she was worried about my blood pressure. I was worried about the fact that I could barely walk, could barely breathe while I was walking.Nothing got resolved in that meeting. Instead, she wanted to come back and see her supervising physician, to see if he could figure out what was going wrong.They scheduled me in for an appointment on the 6th, quite possibly the fastest turn-around I\u2019ve ever seen in a medical office.This doctor is kind of a polarizing figure in this small town. Some people love him, others absolutely hate him. And, even more personally, Shaunta had had some recent issues with him not coming through when she needed him to.But I went through the appointment because, what the hell, it\u2019s not like I had anything better to do. But I didn\u2019t really have that much faith that things would change.But, goddamn, I was wrong. This doctor put everything into perspective.From the second he looked at me, he said \u201cI can see you\u2019re easily carrying 30\u201340 pounds of fluid weight. That\u2019s easily about 5 gallons of fluid.\u201dWhen you think about it like that, it\u2019s kind of crazy. Five big milk jugs just full of excess fluid hanging onto my body. Inside of my body, dragging me down.He didn\u2019t harp on about my weight, like most doctors who haven\u2019t seen me before are wont to do. Instead, he realized that dealing with the other problems \u2014 the swelling, the constantly feeling like crap, would eventually help with the weight loss \u2014 the weight loss I had already been achieving.He explained why the doctors were worried about my heart \u2014 about the left ventricular hypertrophy that had been showing up in scans, and about how losing weight \u2014 making things easier for my heart \u2014 might lead to reversal in that, and lowering my blood pressure.But the first thing he wanted to do was deal with the fluid.\u201cIf you were an in-patient, I could have all of this fluid off of you in two days,\u201d he told me. \u201cBut since you\u2019d probably have to have a catheter, just to keep you from getting up and down to pee, I\u2019m not going to recommend that.\u201dInstead, he decided to go through my list of medications.Like, more than everybody else in the house combined.But the doctor went through the list, striking things off. \u201cThis isn\u2019t working. This isn\u2019t working. I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re on this.\u201dThen he looked at me and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take this home. The nurse will call you tomorrow with new instructions. I hope you\u2019re prepared to pee.\u201dWe shook hands, and that was that. I went home, hoping that he would actually follow through and that I\u2019d get the call back.I did. The next day, the nurse called, and had me write down the new orders. The doctor was removing me from four of the medications I was on, and placing me on two new ones, Bumex and Metolazone, and insistent orders that I have blood work done at the end of the week, to make sure my kidneys were still working.Okay, like that isn\u2019t ominous at all. But I figured, what the hell. I could live without kidneys. I couldn\u2019t live with my legs like this.My first night after taking the pills, I didn\u2019t sleep at all. I was up peeing every hour.That\u2019s not an exaggeration. Every hour.Within two days, the loss of swelling was noticeable. Both legs were remarkably smaller.I\u2019m about a week in to the pills now. Most of the swelling is gone, to the amazement of just about everybody. I feel the best that I\u2019ve felt in three months. I can walk easier. I can breathe easier. I can make it all the way up the stairs without having to take a break.There\u2019s still a little bit of swelling in my upper right thigh, a hard nodule that kind of worries me, but it\u2019s much smaller than it was before. I hope that the pills will keep doing their work, and eventually bust that.I want to work on my book again. I need to come back to writing regularly on Medium. I want to start heading down to the Y and swimming regularly.Just being stuck inside this body sometimes, makes everything harder. Even the things you\u2019d think would be easy, if you\u2019re forced to stay in your chair, in front of the computer.That that panic, that anxiety, that worry, it drains everything away. It becomes easier to scroll, to get lost doing mindless things, to just stop doing everything. Like a depressive episode, almost, except it\u2019s your body betraying you, not your brain. Regardless, the symptoms are similar: it\u2019s easier to let the undertow pull you all the way down.But I can breathe again, for now. I get to pick up everything that I dropped, and start trying to juggle it again.Sonnets, &c. \u2014 poems from Zach J. PayneZach J.

A person cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick.\u201d \u2014 P.T. BarnumDependence on technology has increased significantly over the course of last few decades, and it has crept into every corner of our lives: from obsessive texting to checking emails more often than a stockbroker eyeballs the Dow.Consequently, life has become fast-paced, which has not only impacted our daily routines but also directly affected our way of living i.e., our lifestyle. People, especially in the urban areas, are adopting unhealthy eating habits mainly because of daily routine imbalance. Work-induced stress and anxiety are increasing while health affecting activities such as smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeine-containing beverages, or eating junk food are on the rise. All this is affecting not only our physical but mental wellbeing as well, which has deteriorated the quality of human life despite all the comforts and amenities of the modern lifestyle. This is another reason why there is an increasing prevalence of infertility resulting from delay in childbearing, lifestyle as well as environmental factors. It is estimated that by year 2100, 400 million individuals or 3% of the world population may be alive as a result of IVF, ICSI and other fertility treatments.In all this, there are still many ways where a person can leave the artificial mechanized life and strive for a more healthy, natural, and active lifestyle. However, when it comes to traditional wellness and lifestyle, consumers struggle when it comes to finding a one-stop solution for all of their health, wellness, and lifestyle needs. Similarly, for merchants, it is hard to reach out and scale their businesses across the world as while every country has its own platform that may serve this purpose, it is limited to serving only local customers.With Sheng World, all this changes completely. Consumers get access to all sorts of lifestyle and wellness related products and solutions under one platform. At the same time, merchants can work with other merchants both locally and internationally, and reach out to global customers that require services in the wellness and lifestyle industriesSheng World serves as the first-ever B2B4C platform that harnesses the power of blockchain and AI to create an entire ecosystem for the lifestyle and wellness industries. It offers services and products that enrich the mind, body, and soul, allowing users to celebrate life and rejuvenate from the grind of daily life. Powered by blockchain, Sheng World is fueled by two (2) tokens, i.e., the SHENG Token, which is used as a reward and staking token, and the LIFE Token, which is the token that will be exchanged for goods and services in the SHENG Marketplace.

It\u2019s called being human. It\u2019s not a weakness or a character flaw, it is an integral part of our lives.You can\u2019t wake up with a huge smile, ready to kick ass \u2014 all your life. This is not how it works. Moreover, seeing how others are spewing positivity all the time can put pressure on you to feel good \u2014 and that will just worsen your bad day.We all have bad days. Sometimes a string of bad days, when our whole life looks gloomy and desperate. When nothing works out and everything tells us we are a failure.Having a bad day is mostly out of our influence. It can be due to bad news, unexpected turn out of events, or events that are too negative to put a positive spin on it.Bad days come and go and sometimes it\u2019s beyond your conscious decision to do something about it. You don\u2019t need to feel ashamed of it \u2014 it\u2019s not that you are weak or useless. It\u2019s only human to be influenced by external events or even internal thoughts and feelings.But you can fight it.You get to choose what you do. You can still make a powerful choice.You can fight your tiredness, your depression and your anxiety.The worst thing about bad days is that you feel powerless \u2014 as if life was choosing instead of you; as if you\u2019re nothing but a puppet thrown around by a tornado.Everyone goes through difficulties, the going gets tough and you feel out of control. Your sense of reality gets distorted, your helplessness takes over and it seems there is nothing you can do.You can take back control. You can reach for something to cling to. Something that you know you can do, even if it feels you can\u2019t do anything.You can take back control over your bad day by choosing to do something that reminds you that you are in charge of your whole life \u2014 and not the other way around.The choice to do something you control makes you stronger. It makes you believe that no matter how difficult everything is, no matter how powerless the external events make you feel, you are in charge.Taking action will show you that you still have the power over your life. It\u2019s not about grandiose things. It\u2019s just to start and put one foot in front of the other.You don\u2019t need to set huge goals. You don\u2019t need to visualise great accomplishments. You just need to take action \u2014 and just do it. Whatever is your choice of action, being the one deciding to make a move instead of waiting around for life to turn around has a magic to it.The easiest way to snap out of your bad day and take back control is to move. It\u2019s so simple. It\u2019s so obvious. It\u2019s too easy even. Its uncomplicatedness suggests that it won\u2019t work. But not everything has to be a struggle in life. It\u2019s not always about fighting for good things. Sometimes the simplest, tritest things hold the most power.Moving is relative too. Maybe today for you it is just to get out of bed instead of hitting the snooze button. Maybe it is to get dressed after a week spent in PJs. Maybe it\u2019s to go out for a walk or a short run. Maybe it\u2019s 5 minutes of stretching or holding a couple of yoga poses for a few minutes.Doing any sort of physical exercises, such as walking, running, 60 seconds planking or 10 burpees work like magic to shift your focus. They might sound too little but you have to start somewhere \u2014 don\u2019t diss a short exercise just because it seems insufficient.Imagine your bad day as being at the bottom of a ladder. You don\u2019t have wings to fly to the top where you would already feel good, you need to climb up, one step after the other.The first step looks daunting, but it\u2019s your ladder and you decide how small that first step needs to be. Putting on your running shoes is a simple thing \u2014 you can\u2019t fail. Deciding to just go out for a 10-minute walk is easy. Accelerating your steps after a few minutes might already come naturally as an internal urge. And if you decide to jog and speed up a bit while you\u2019re at it, that\u2019s the best!It\u2019s so easy to doubt ourselves. To tell ourselves how we will fail. We are very creative in coming up excuses. Trick yourself and do something for yourself today. Anything. Really!No matter how slow you go, your progress starts with a simple first step. With a no-brainer motion. With something that will nevertheless send the message to your brain that it\u2019s you to call the shots.I\u2019m not talking about new year resolutions and how to keep them, although that works pretty much the same.Just do something for yourself today if you feel powerless.And watch how life brightens up after a 10-minute brisk walk or a 7-minute stretching exercise or HIIT training. It\u2019s not about weight loss or fitness. It\u2019s about being in charge \u2014 today and then tomorrow again.If you liked this and want some more, follow me on Twitter or IG and sign up for my newsletter.Written byWritten by","17564":"Two years ago, my divorce burned a swath through my mental health in ways I wasn\u2019t prepared for. I was absolutely ruined. I underestimated how something I knew in my heart I wanted and knew was right could destroy me so much.When I asked for a divorce, I thought I would feel better. I would be on a path toward changing my life into what I wanted it to be. It required sifting through the rubble that remained to do that rebuilding. I didn\u2019t have it in me and ended up staring at a mess instead.Emotionally, I was totaled. I cried every day for months. Every damn day.After what felt like a monumental breakdown, I took advantage of our employee assistance program and went to see a therapist. I realized it was no time for foolish pride. I just needed to stop crying.At first, it was wonderful and cathartic and I felt stronger. It was an initial release of the breath I had been holding in for ages.That feeling wore off fast. I couldn\u2019t even figure out how to do therapy right. It didn\u2019t seem like my thing. I wanted to be good at it, in the same way, I\u2019d love to be good at yoga but I\u2019m not. My brain is too noisy.I am a horrible over-thinker. There are times when I let ideas, fears, and insecurities occupy way too much space in my brain. For me, therapy didn\u2019t seem to make that space smaller. Spending an hour talking about something and over-analyzing it and then having somebody else analyze it made that space bigger. It gave it too much power.I wanted to feel good about my therapy but quickly realized I was going for the wrong reasons. I thought, \u201cOh, look. I\u2019m in therapy. I\u2019m totally together.\u201d It\u2019s really easy to fool yourself into believing that.I\u2019d cherry-pick things to tell my therapist. The easy stuff. It wasn\u2019t hard to pull off. I could leave out anything that I deemed too difficult to work on and only focus on the things that didn\u2019t require much effort.I can make this easy, I told myself. I\u2019d spend an hour that I was paying heavily for and dance around the hard issues. She\u2019d listen, give advice as best she could based on what I told her, and task me with work to do until the next session. In theory, this sounds perfect.But, when you manipulate your therapy and you game the system, you don\u2019t even have to do that work. You can fake it. You can lie and say that you did that wonderful journal entry, but you don\u2019t.Suddenly, I was back in college participating in a discussion of a book I never finished reading. Hell, if it worked back then I could make it work now.My therapist didn\u2019t know what was in the back of my mind. But I did. I could hide all of the worst from her but I couldn\u2019t hide it from myself. Eventually, it caught up with me.After I couple of months, I had burned through the trivial stuff and dealt with the low hanging fruit. I had spent hundreds of dollars and felt no better. I was tired of feeling like hell. I had run out of places to hide.I had a choice: remain miserable or roll up my sleeves. I made a list of everything I hadn\u2019t addressed but needed to. I prioritized it and brought it to my therapist. She took one look at it and said, \u201cThis. This is something.\u201dMy therapist is the gentlest purveyor of tough love I have ever met. She would not accept my negative self-talk. She asked me to confront it in straight forward ways. She pushed me to be kinder, stop judging myself and recognize my worth.Some days, that was easy. Some days, it was hard as hell. I had to stop planning my therapy sessions during my lunch hour because I was emotionally exhausted and had to sit and process everything.It got to the point where it was effortless. I learned triggers and how to avoid them. I began standing up for myself. For the first time in my life, I set boundaries. All of this was a set of coping mechanisms I desperately needed.Ironically, the harder I worked the less I had to go to therapy. Once a week turned into every other week and then to once a month. At this point, I go when I need to. What I really love is that I can recognize when it\u2019s needed. Being that honest and accountable to myself and my own mental health feels amazing.Written byWritten by","17607":"And how you too can protect yourself from the environmental toxinMost of us live in industrialised cities across the world, so it is very difficult if not impossible NOT to be affected by air pollution. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has confirmed that air pollution is a carcinogen.Air pollution is the emission of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen from smoke and other harmful gases from various apparatus into the air. The emission lowers the quality of the air we breathe in and therefore dangerous to our health.In most industrialised cities, major causes are smoke and exhaust from types of various machinery including vehicles emission. In the ordinary sense, we also do get pollution from some household cleaning items, which are usually irritant and made from part-toxin products.The effect of global warming and toxic emission from pollutants in the sea has reached an intolerable level that is a concern we cannot ignore, and this also does cause air pollution.Air pollution has a serious effect on human and environmental health. It is known to cause serious illnesses like pulmonary diseases, asthma, stroke, heart diseases and other chronic illnesses.In a highly industrialised city like China (deem manufacturing country of the world), death due to pollution is as high as 16.9% of the population, and this is increasing by the day. China is, unfortunately, the most polluted country in the world, and will, therefore, be a point of reference in studies relating to environmental pollution.In the United Kingdom where I live, poor air quality is one the largest environmental risk to health. The cost in money terms to the Department of Environment is about \u00a340 billion each year, and the death rate caused by air pollution is around 8.3% of the population.With such staggering statistics, it is therefore beneficial to us to look for ways to minimise the impact of the environmental toxin on our health, and whether as usual, we can look at what nature has provided for us in food is relevant here.Researchers from John Hopkins University conducted extensive studies on Broccoli Sprouts and the results were very impressive. These studies were conducted in the most polluted areas in both China and the United States.\u2018\u2019Air pollution is a pervasive and complex public health problem. To address this problem comprehensively, in addition to the engineering solutions to reduce regional pollution emission, we need to translate our basic science into strategies to protect individuals from these exposures. This development supports food-based strategies as part of the overall prevention effort\u2019\u2019 George Groopman & Anna M. BaetjerThese studies were conducted on 291 adults. Half were made to drink half a cup of broccoli sprouts juice, while the other \u2018placebo\u2019 group took pineapple with lime juice.Within the twelve weeks of study, the group who took broccoli sprouts juice were able to eliminate benzene in their body by 61%, increased their excretion of acrolein by 23%. Having too much acrolein in the body may result in respiratory tract infection.Benzene is a known carcinogen, which is emitted from vehicles exhausts, gas station, smoking and other toxic combustion. Burning fuel, oil and gas, as well as smoking rather gives out acrolein in the air.The researchers found that broccoli sprout contains a powerful compound called GLUCORAPHANIN. This compound is present in all cruciferous vegetables. In animal studies, when glucoraphanin is chewed or swallowed, it produces a cancer-protective compound SULFORAPHANE. This sulforaphane absorbs toxins from the body and flushes them out through urine.The rate of this detoxification continues throughout the twelve weeks study and is effective for air pollution and other irritants that are just been absorbed in the body. The study did not go further to investigate whether this is true for long term irritants and pollutant that have found its way into the fat cells.It is a well-known fact that most cruciferous vegetables, like Kale, Broccoli, Pak Choi, Cauliflower, Cabbage and Brussels sprouts are known to fight cancer. This is done by the ability of the sulforaphane to support the liver ability for detoxification.The best way to get sulforaphane is to sprout your broccoli organic seeds in your own home. At between five and six days old, the sulforaphane in broccoli sprout contains up to 100 times more than in mature plant. The sprouts can also be used in smoothies, sandwiches, wraps or salad apart from juicing.Broccoli sprouts are now readily available in major retail stores, but make sure you buy organic, non-GMO, or better still buy the seeds and sprout at home.Written byWritten by","17679":"When it comes to training for fat loss in the gym, you could ask three different people what the best option is and easily get three different answers.One person may swear by high intensity interval training. Another may say that long duration, low intensity, steady state cardio is the best way to go. And yet another may recommend \u201cboot camp\u201d style group classes, where the pace is quick and the heart rate stays elevated.There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with any of those\u2014 they\u2019re all useful fat burning tools in their own right.But the question was, \u201cwhat\u2019s the best option to burn fat in the gym?\u201dAnd what most people really mean by that is \u2014 what\u2019s the best option to burn body fat and develop a shaped, toned physique?The answer? Good old fashioned resistance training.Understand that when we say we simply want to look \u201cshaped and toned\u201d, they are not the same thing.Your body is \u201cshaped\u201d by the appearance of your muscles. When you perform resistance training, your muscles are developed and given a distinct shape.In order to become \u201ctoned\u201d, the layer of fat that is covering those muscles has to be stripped away.Muscle is metabolically active. It is very \u201cexpensive\u201d tissue for the body to maintain \u2014 meaning, the more muscle you have, the more calories your body has to burn throughout the day in order to maintain it.Therefore, the single most effective thing you can be doing while in the gym to burn fat is to build muscle!Developed muscles + low body fat levels = shaped and toned.Resistance training is any exercise that causes the muscles to contract against an external resistance with the expectation of increases in strength, power, hypertrophy, and\/or endurance. The external resistance can be dumbbells, exercise tubing, your own body weight, bricks, bottles of water, or any other object that causes the muscles to contract. \u2014 TREK EducationYou don\u2019t need a ton different exercises, especially in the beginning.Choose a variation of an upper body push (presses, push ups), an upper body pull (pull ups, rows), a squat, and a hip hinge movement (deadlifts, hip thrusts).Probably sounds stupidly simple. Because it is.If you don\u2019t have immediate access to a gym, use your own bodyweight to start. Push ups, pull ups, squats, lunges, planks \u2014 there are countless exercises of this nature that you could perform alone on your bedroom floor.Keep things simple until you\u2019ve mastered the basics; once you\u2019re ready, progressively overload them. You can read about the countless different ways to do that here.We\u2019ve established that weight training is the single most efficient use of your time at the gym to burn fat and build a lean, athletic looking physique.But the question of \u201cwhat\u2019s the best way to burn fat?\u201d goes far beyond merely what you\u2019re doing in the gym, because what you should be doing outside of it is of equal (if not greater) importance \u2014 namely, eating right and getting enough rest.The \u201crest\u201d part is pretty self explanatory \u2014 don\u2019t make a habit of staying up into odd hours of the night (guilty), especially if you\u2019ve got to be at work or school early in the morning.Discipline yourself to get a quality 7\u20138 hours of sleep every night. Turn off the TV and put down the electronics an hour before bed; allow your body to heal.As for the \u201ceating right\u201d part \u2014 keep in mind that I don\u2019t believe in strict diets, because most of the time, they don\u2019t work. When you put yourself in the mindset that you\u2019re \u201con a diet\u201d, that means eventually you plan on coming \u201coff\u201d the diet.What you need is to develop healthy habits that you can adhere to for a lifetime.If you like the ketogenic\/paleo\/intermittent fasting\/etc. diet and could adhere to it for the next 50 years, more power to you.But if you\u2019re just doing it as a \u201cmeans to an end\u201d and feel miserable all the time, you\u2019re in trouble. Will power on its own can only take us so far \u2014 if you can\u2019t do it for life, the results aren\u2019t going to last.Find an eating style that fits YOU and stick with it.Not at all. Cardiovascular health is critical to maintaining a high quality of life. I like to perform low intensity, steady state cardio in the form of a brisk paced walk 2\u20134 times per week.But when it comes to being \u201cshaped and toned\u201d, this should be considered more of the cherry on top as opposed to your primary focus.Consider an overweight person that utilizes only cardio and under eating as their two primary tools to lose weight. They turn into a smaller version of themselves.Instead of looking \u201clean and athletic\u201d, they become \u201cskinny fat\u201d, because they\u2019ve neglected the weights and no muscle has been built. They have no shape underneath the fat they\u2019re trying to burn off, and will therefore look proportionately the same.If you\u2019re trying to get from 8% body fat down to 6%, adding cardio into your program can be a useful tool to help burn off those last few stubborn pounds of fat \u2014 but it is simply not the foundation of any effective fat loss plan.Training to build muscle is the single most effective use of your time to burn fat while in the gym. It is a prerequisite for a lean, defined physique.But it goes beyond just that, because your training, your nutrition, and your recovery must be dialed in to achieve optimal results.So prioritize resistance training in your workout plan, utilize progressive overload when you\u2019re ready, make sensible food choices, and make adequate sleep a priority.That\u2019s your fat burning foundation.Thanks so much for reading.

On his lap an AK47 is perched as comfortably as a kitten.He\u2019s talking to an inmate, a young Rwandan sitting on the rough concrete floor. He looks no older than 20, outfitted with a roughed-up jacket, holey pants and a shiny pair of handcuffs.Above the officer, an informational poster is taped to the faded and cracked yellow plaster wall.This was definitely not on the list of places I imagined visiting in Rwanda.My day started simply enough; my plan was straightforward: double-down on my writing in the morning, work on my startup in the afternoon, enjoy three square meals around the table with the family, and play with my boys.But that all changed the minute I opened my laptop.\u201cI have the power to help someone today.\u201dThis single phrase, written out in bold script on a thin strip of paper, was written over a year ago as I worked with my friend and life coach, Amber Deibert.The message, taped to the bottom of my screen, pops up before anything on my screen appears. The original bright white printer paper and black ink have faded over time, but its message remains crisp and unmistakable.I possess the power to help.It\u2019s a power I too often take for granted; a power I\u2019ve been made more aware of than ever before, thanks to my new surroundings.In Rwanda today, there are unfortunately few that possess this same power. 60% of the population lives in extreme poverty, earning less than $1.90\/day.It ia sobering statistic, but one that is thankfully improving rapidly in Rwanda. Its global income ranking has improved from the seventh poorest in 2000 to the twentieth in 2015 and the percentage of people living below the poverty line from 57 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2010.But, as I\u2019m reminded this morning, extreme poverty is about more than money and statistics. It\u2019s about the range of possibilities one person has at any given moment in their life.Sitting comfortably in front of my MacBook Pro, I have a seemingly endless number of ways I can spend my day.My friend Aphrodis, however, has none compared to yesterday.So often I shy away from helping, not because I\u2019m mean-spirited but rather lazy.Helping someone else is rarely comfortable, rarely convenient, and rarely takes the amount of time that you had in mind.To help someone else is to voluntarily jump out of your comfort zone at 10,000 feet and go spiraling headfirst into a zone where you\u2019re no longer in control of your circumstances.It\u2019s a reality of which I\u2019m painfully reminded as I sit uncomfortably staring at my $100 shoes in this Rwandan jail.If I had to sketch out a visual representation of an effort zone, this would be a dandy.In the room next to me, Aphrodis is working hard on identity papers so he can get a new national identity card.Just the day before Aphrodis was anxiously excited to get his driver's license, a huge leap forward in his life.He had just finished his initial exam at the testing center and was on his way home when, somewhere along the way, he lost his Rwandan ID card.It was a devastating blow. With his identity card gone, Aphrodis\u2019 options once again crashed to near nothing.Instead of getting his license and moving onto a better job and better pay to help support his mother and siblings in the Eastern Province, he\u2019d now have to wait two more months in limbo, waiting for his new ID to arrive.Aphrodis was planning on spending all day and night trying to get these papers. He was going to rise early this morning, take a 7:30 AM bus two hours to his home province in the north of the country, then spend all day shuffling over dirt roads on moto-taxis between his village, then district, then sector administrative offices.Adding to the sinking feeling of despair for Aphrodis was the cost of the day. The bus, the moto-taxis, and the paperwork would cost him $20.00, more than a third of his monthly salary.It was money that should go to family, critical money that they would have to go without because of his mistake.The fog of extreme poverty was thick in Aphrodis\u2019 crestfallen expression. He had dared to go higher than ever before in his life and now there was nothing but rock-hard disappointment to meet him as he crashed to the ground.Aphrodis, because of no other reason than where he was born, had no power to help himself out of this problem.I, because of no other reason than where I was born, do.I can\u2019t find his lost ID card and I can\u2019t change Rwandan bureaucracy, but I have the power to make some small difference.Instead of spending $20.00 and 12 hours on public transportation, Aphrodis, my two sons and I, spent half a day driving around the Northern Province of Rwanda together.We rumbled over the dirt roads together, met members of Aphrodis\u2019 family and saw him wave to friends as we passed.We bought sambussas and cakes and Lemon Fanta for breakfast and played soccer outside remote administrative outposts planted in some of the most verdant and beautiful countrysides I\u2019ve ever witnessed.When we arrived at the police station, Aphrodis asked politely if I\u2019d be willing to come in with him.Uncertain as to why, I agreed (because I could).Walking into that intake room, filled with a dozen or more locals, it was evident that the options available to everyone were as plentiful as the room\u2019s furnishings and decor.Immediately, a police officer appeared in the doorway.Seeing us together, he approached Aphrodis and began chatting in Kinyarwanda.Two minutes later, Aprhodis was ushered into an office while I waited uncomfortably, smiling and offering \u201cNwaramutse\u201d (translation: good morning) to as many people in the room as would look at me.Thankfully, my poor attempts at Kinyarwanda always draw a smile, even in jail.Driving home from our morning\u2019s outing, I asked Aphrodis the question I had been pondering during my long and uncomfortable stay in the intake room.\u201cAphrodis?\u201d I began, glancing over to him in the passenger seat.\u201cmmm\u2026 Yes?\u201d he responded flatly, leading with his typical low hum.\u201cWhy did you have me come into the police station with you?\u201d\u201cmmm\u2026 The first time I went in,\u201d he began, \u201cthe police did not even talk to me.\u201d\u201cSo did you bring me in so you could be helped faster? Was I your fast pass?\u201d I asked, momentarily amused at the mental comparison I had between Rwandan jail and Disneyland.\u201cmmm\u2026 Yes,\u201d Aprodis responded matter-of-factly.For a moment I was saddened by the thought that my white skin could offer up such an advantage. What right did I have, as a lucky American, to walk into any place in the world, and expect superior attention and treatment?The thought passed as quickly as the two locals we were just then passing, each of their bikes loaded down with a large woven basket carrying a few goats strapped inside.As unfair as it was, being white and overprivileged was my power today. It was my unfair advantage in a world where options for advancement are as rare as an American in a Rwandan jail.I couldn\u2019t change the world, but I could use my power to help a friend.In the process, as is the case with any effort zone, I gained far more than I ever gave.Here\u2019s my free guide to having a traveler\u2019s mindset even when you\u2019re at homeUnique world perspectives from the roaming desks of MindTrip\u00a0Take a lookCreate a free Medium account to get MindTrip Stories  in your inbox.Written byWritten by","17842":"It\u2019s 7:45 PM on a Friday night and I\u2019ve just been struck upside the head by pure brilliance.Throwing on my \u201ctenniz\u201d (aka the shoes you don\u2019t wear in French public unless you\u2019re intentionally sweating), I grab the keys to our 2004 Citroen minivan, and, faster than my four boys can say \u201cHarry Potter Muggle Movie Marathon,\u201d I\u2019m winding down through vineyard-clad hills of the French Beaujolais countryside for a last-minute movie snack run at our local grocery store.10 minutes is all it takes for me to drift into the nearly-deserted parking lot. I hop out of the minivan, a popcorn commando ready to conquer, but to my dismay, the last few lights in the store are flicking off and an ear-splitting metal security barrier is lowering before my eyes.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d my American brain struggles to compute after only four weeks of living in France:Friday family movie night + Snack Craving + 7:55 PM should = Mission completeDid I miss a zero in the calculation? Is it a national holiday? No, it\u2019s France and, as it turns out, every night is a holiday when compared to my conventional Midwest American upbringing.To anyone looking to spend a chunk of time abroad, be it months or years, be aware that you\u2019ll go through a natural period of transition that has affected explorers ever since the world got unflattened:Following a blissful honeymoon stage will come the stretch of road known as \u201cCulture Shock\u201d where you mentally scrawl out a list of things you find annoying, very annoying, about your new home.While skipping over the step is impossible, know that what you find annoying at first will turn to amusing, then possibly even endearing and eventually admirable. This is known as Adaptation.As Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia Business School and travel researcher, points out, it\u2019s during this stage of Adaption where the richness of foreign living begins to take hold:\u201cForeign experiences increase both cognitive flexibility and depth and integrativeness of thought, the ability to make deep connections between disparate forms\u2026The key, critical process is multicultural engagement, immersion, and adaptation. Someone who lives abroad and doesn\u2019t engage with the local culture will likely get less of a creative boost than someone who travels abroad and really engages in the local environment.\u201dWith that in mind, here three things about French living that I initially rejected, then learned to admire, then wondered how I ever lived without:America still reigns as the gold-standard in service-based economies. If you want something in America, you can usually have it within minutes. Everything is about me as a customer and the customer is always right.For example, if you\u2019re American, how often have you pictured your grocery store cashier sitting down at their dining room table to enjoy an evening meal with loved ones?Answer: you probably haven\u2019t.In fact, if you\u2019ve pictured them eating dinner at all, it\u2019s probably alone in a break room plastered with health code reminders tucked away somewhere between the storage closest and the bathrooms.The unspoken takeaway is that in America we consider workers as less than shoppers, a form of subconscious commercial class system.Workers in the service industry are there to serve us, enjoying their work no matter the hour. After all, as they\u2019re smiling most of the time, they must love tending the lettuce in the produce section at 11:00 PM at night instead of snuggling with a loved one.We never even stop to ask.In France, by contrast, 24\/7 consumer support is as appreciated as the Black Death a few hundred years back.If a store closes at 8:00 PM, which many do (especially outside major metropolitan areas), then expect to have store employees chasing you out by 7:55 at the latest.The French answer to this seeming anomaly is startlingly straightforward:\u201c8:00 PM is dinner time and everyone has a right to go home and enjoy their evening. If you got a problem with that, then you better buy your groceries well before 7:30 PM.\u201dPerhaps you\u2019ve heard how French women don\u2019t get fat. French men and kids don\u2019t either. This is because the French have a 4-step regimented eating schedule that best resembles a caloric bell curve:Living in France you quickly learn how their eating habits are more closely observed than the Ten Commandments and holier than the Trinity.For example, mid-afternoon in France is a sacred time for kids, the one time outside of meals when they are allowed to eat.Snack time, or \u201cle go\u00fbter\u201d (translation: the snack time), dates back to Louis XIV. This comes as no surprise, as most things in France that the French deem worth keeping come either from Louis XIV or Napoleon.Pre-Louis XIV (circa the 17th Century), the standard eating schedule in France was breakfast between 9h00 and 10h00, work all day, and then dine between 17h00 and 19h00.Given that this was the 17th century and 100 plus years before the Industrial Revolution, the average \u201cworkday\u201d consisted of toiling away in fields with your co-serfers for hours on end, with the occasional berating by your lord\u2019s henchmen.It was a working condition to die for, and many did just that.Recognizing the problem, Louis XIV, also known as The Sun King, divinely added a third meal to the day, choosing to eat at 8h30, 13h00, and then dine at 22h00 PM. As most peasants and workers couldn\u2019t last until 10:00 PM to eat their last meal, a moment of digestion, known as \u201cLe go\u00fbter,\u201d was inserted into the French daily gastronomical chart.In its most basic form, \u201cLe go\u00fbter\u201d was initiated to keep the French from eating too much before bed. The word \u201cdinner\u201d at the time of Louis XVI was non-existent. You would not \u201cdine\u201d but rather \u201csoup.\u201d Hence, the need for a influx of energy mid-afternoon to carry you through the remainder of the school or work day.The key takeaway: when you\u2019re dieting plan comes from a local TV celebrity or health guru (as is often the case in America), it\u2019s shelf life is guaranteed to be limited to weeks, maybe months at best.However, get a meal plan directly from France\u2019s \u201cSun King,\u201d and you\u2019ll be following it for centuries to come.Adam Alter, an American social psychologist, has recently pointed out how a lack of \u201cstopping cues\u201d is one of the main reasons our smartphones are so addictive:\u201cA stopping cue is basically a signal that it\u2019s time to move on, to do something new, to do something different. Think about newspapers; eventually you get to the end\u2026 The same with magazines, books \u2014 you get to the end of a chapter,[which] prompts you to consider whether you want to continue. But the way we consume media today is such that there are no stopping cues. The news feed just rolls on, and everything\u2019s bottomless: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, email, text messaging, the news.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot in American society that mirrors our addiction to smartphones. America is a non-stop nation, open 24\/7, 365 days a week.Consequently, there are no lifestyle stopping cues to tell us when to take a break from working and start living.Often we try and single-handedly build it into our daily lives through life hacks, but it remains difficult when the surrounding environment never sits still.France, on the other hand, has mastered the art of lifestyle stopping cues. A perfect example is found in the academic calendar, a system which also helps regulate much of the country\u2019s internal tourist activity:You can see from the calendar key above there are three school zones (A, B, C). Your zone dictates the dates you have off, but the timing is essentially the same across the board: School starts beginning September and for every six weeks of school the children have a two-week stopping cue. This is when French families plan their staple family vacations.This doesn\u2019t mean that the country shuts down every six weeks (July and August are a different story), but it does mean that most French families are planning 3\u20134 significant \u201cgetaways\u201d during the course of the year; breaks dedicated to refreshing and renewing the aspects of their lives that matter most.Conversely, Americans are quickly becoming most famous for not taking their vacation days. As recently reported by the U.S. Travel Association:Americans left a record 662 million vacation days unused in 2016.Note, this does not mean that daily life in France is less hectic than in America. Many French families have two working parents. Many of those parents, not unlike their American counterparts, commute long hours and work well into the evening.Unlike their American counterparts, however, the French know when to stop and take a break thanks to an environment that makes it easy, even almost mandatory.While there\u2019s plenty to admire in France, it\u2019s worth noting that behind each of these three \u201cenviable traits\u201d lies a culture driven by strong deference to authority and severe adherence to a clearly-established societal hierarchy.For example, French students are raised in a system where academic perfection is a statistical impossibility. The standard grading system in France is numerically-based, with a \u201c20\u201d being equivalent to an \u201cA\u201d in the US.If, however, you were to take a random sampling of 50 high school students from across France and ask them how many times they had received a \u201c20\u201d on an assignment and test, they could collectively count the number on one closed fist. It simply doesn\u2019t happen.Contrast this with an American system where younger students regularly receive the equivalent of 25 out of 20 (A+++), and high-school students easily reach perfection, often with slightly-above-average input.The result of these two very different systems becomes much more evident as French and American children mature and become adults.As an American in France, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find any French person as confident in their ability and assured of their success as you are:As Americans, we\u2019re raised to believe we can become anything. In France, you\u2019re raised to believe that you do whatever you\u2019re told.In America we celebrate failure as a learning experience. In France, failure marks, well\u2026 total and absolute failure.The constraints that come from such a severe upbringing create a two-foot thick glass ceiling that\u2019s usually low enough that most French adults can reach up and touch it.So, if ever you\u2019re an American living in France, fully embrace your \u201cYes, We Can!\u201d mentality. It\u2019s a quality that many French admire in Americans and can easily make you stand out professionally and academically.In the end, living in another culture places you in a magical no man\u2019s land where suddenly forced out between two cultures, you\u2019re pushed to assume a new identity that in our case is neither home nor foreign, but uniquely you.It\u2019s like going from eating meat and potatoes every night to suddenly having a giant cultural buffet to choose from.Choose your dishes wisely as you wander, incorporating the best of the worlds you encounter and I guarantee your life will be richer and more fulfilling than you could ever imagine.Here\u2019s my free guide to having a traveler\u2019s mindset even when you\u2019re at homeUnique world perspectives from the roaming desks of MindTrip\u00a0Take a lookCreate a free Medium account to get MindTrip Stories  in your inbox.Written byWritten by","17860":"The benefits of exercise don\u2019t end at making you look good, they also make you feel good and think better. According to a study, physical activity has been linked to visible improvements in a person\u2019s mental health and overall well-being. What they found was surprising.The 2016 study conducted to show the relationship between physical activity and mental health showcased growing evidence that a healthy body and a healthy mind go hand in hand. A flood of endorphins from physical activity has been shown to improve if not prevent symptoms of anxiety and depression.Martial arts is more than just physical activity, and that is why the benefits you will get from this discipline of the physical arts is far more than what even regular trips to the gym can bring you. Martial arts actually helps people to lead calmer, more self-possessed lives, improve attention and generally foster good mental health.Mindfulness is a meditative technique that focuses on deliberately drawing your attention to the present moment, and focusing your mind solely on living in the present. If you practice martial arts, then two key skills that you cannot progress without, are discipline, and mindfulness.Martial Arts is a kind of physical exercise that does not just train the body, but also the mind. The mind has to be trained to respond properly and in-time to various real-life scenarios, especially if you intend to participate in competitions and rise through the ranks of your chosen kind of martial art. Some kinds of martial arts, such as Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) are more physically intensive than styles like Tai Chi which require greater patience and mastery over the mind.Martial Arts is considered a form of AST, where the learner has to train both the body and the mind to obtain the best benefits from this artform.AT or Attention Training versus AST or Attention State Training is another way to understand the role of mindfulness and discipline in martial arts. While Attention Training\/AT focuses on training a skill so that the learner improves with practice, Attention State Training\/AST highlights the importance of training the state of mind the learner is in, in order to encourage focus and determined growth.A study was conducted in the United States where children aged between eight and eleven were given training in martial arts as a part of an anti-bullying program. The children were taught not only how to defend themselves, but also how to respect others alongside themselves. Since martial arts heavily emphasises respective the teacher\/guru\/sensei, the moral values this physical activity brings also aids in developing emotional intelligence and social skills.The children were also taught how to control themselves when faced with aggressive situations.The results of the experiment showed that the children that practised martial arts had reduced levels of overall aggression towards others, and that they were more likely to step in and help another person if required.Various martial arts, such as Kickboxing and Muay Thai require calculated strikes in order to make an impact. Self-discipline and control become a part of the growth process for those invested in learning a form of martial arts.Martial Arts doesn\u2019t just benefit children, studies indicate that it can help older people control their emotional health as well .The aforementioned study was conducted using three control groups where one group received martial arts training in Karate, another received cognitive training, and the third received physical training that was not related to martial arts. The study comprised of a group of 45 adults aged between 67 and 93.After the results were collated, it was discovered that the group that received training in martial arts showed lowered levels of depression and increased self-esteem when compared to other groups.It is already well known that physical activity releases chemicals like serotonin and endorphins that improve the state of the mind, alongside the body. However the increase in self-esteem can also be attributed to different factors exclusive to martial arts that are not always present in only physical training. One of these is the reduced feelings of powerlessness. Martial arts was once used as a way to fight off dacoits and thieves when they came to attack peoples homes. It gave the people a sense of power as well as the knowledge that they could protect themselves should push come to shove.Martial Arts is also a social activity that focuses not only on self-defense, but also on overall development as an individual. Men, women and children of all ages can enjoy the benefits of brain power and development through martial arts.Italian researchers have discovered that Karate has been linked to improvement in a person\u2019s memory. Children who learn Karate from an early age have a decided advantage while growing up. You can consider signing your child up for our Kids Karate course if you would like to see the benefits martial arts can bring into the life of your child. We also offer courses in other martial arts, such as Kids Muay Thai, which offer holistic development as well.Martial Arts have been a part of global tradition throughout history, where most cultures developed ways of self-defense against those that may harm them. Research over the years have shown positive links between mental health, brain power and martial arts.If you want to discover for yourself how much you can grow and improve your mental health if not your whole life through martial arts, look for a Martial Arts Academy with experienced Coaches skilled in training. Most importantly, the coaches should be friendly and approachable on and off the mat.There are many forms of Martial Arts, so talk with a Coach first to get an idea of which Martial Art would suit you best. A good academy or gym will be able to guide you based on your level of fitness, age, body shape and most importantly the reason you wish to study a Martial Art.Most Martial Arts Academies or gyms will run classes in Muay Thai, Jiu Jitsu, Brazilan Jiu Jitsu, Kickboxing, Boxing, Krav Maga and Mixed Martial Arts.I recommend Jiu Jitsu for all ages and levels of fitness but check out my blog post Which Martial Art Style Should I Learn?. It includes links to videos on each style.The most important thing is to get started so that you can get the amazing benefits that a martial arts can bring.To learn more about how you can improve your life through martial arts, check out my blog.See you on the mats,LiamWritten byWritten by","17869":"I told you guys I would let you know when this would happen. I definitely didn\u2019t see it coming so soon, but it\u2019s necessary that I commit myself more to my personal well-being right now.I\u2019ve been having this weird thing the last couple of weeks where everything is sore to varying degrees, up to my hair follicles. Seriously, I wear a hair-thing for a day and it takes two or three days of barely wearing one at all for the pressure to mostly go way.I\u2019m chalking it up to a few things:If you\u2019ve ever been stuffy-nose-pleghmy-sick with asthma, you get why this is such a big deal. If you don\u2019t have asthma, imagine having an illness for your entire life (if anyone was unaware, I\u2019m 26, so I\u2019ve had asthma for 26 years which is it\u2019s own special brand of exhausting), finally getting to a point where you need your maintenance meds less than once a week, and suddenly needing them twice a day.I\u2019ve been pretty stressed out lately. I can\u2019t really explain why. It\u2019s just a lot of little things piling up at once. According to Castlight Health:Multiple studies over the years have demonstrated that stress, depression, and emotional events can cause physical symptoms ranging from short-term and moderate pain to severe and chronic pain and discomfort.I really fell off of the things that help me most with this sort of stuff the last few weeks, so it makes sense that I\u2019ve been getting more and more out-of-touch with myself. I need to get back into the habits of spirituality, ranging from meditation and prayer to special teas, resting properly, and exercising.Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, I travel an hour to work for four hours in the office and an hour back home. Friday nights I also drop my son off with my mom, which is a 40-minute trip, and then there\u2019s 40 minutes coming back home. On Saturdays, I travel an hour to work, then an hour to pick up my son, then a 40 minute ride home. I\u2019m considering coming home by Uber on Saturdays.All told, I do believe that my body is rebelling against it all. I\u2019m going to start off working from home on Tuesdays. Mondays are easily my most stressful day. So let\u2019s see if not having to travel for two days after my most stressful day helps. I think that even when I do come back reliably, I\u2019m going to double up on Sundays, so that I can just hit publish on Monday and not actually worry about writing at all. It won\u2019t make a difference for you guys. That\u2019s just so you know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.It might end up being that I do end up publishing every day after I publish this tonight. Sometimes, things just work that way for me. I can\u2019t explain it. But, realistically, I feel it\u2019s only right to put it out there that I\u2019m sort of taking a break right now. By a break, I mean that at the least I\u2019m not forcing myself to write until I\u2019m not sick again.As a goal of my own, when I do come back reliably, I hope it will be with a schedule of what topics you can *probably* expect from me on which days of the week.I\u2019ll still be here reading. I\u2019ll also still be checking for people submitting to Today I Learned a Thing. I don\u2019t want to be a butthead about this \u201csort of break\u201d.Written byWritten by","17958":"Having houseplants at home help remove common household toxinsLast week, I did write about experimental research conducted in highly polluted areas of both China and America that showed how eating broccoli sprouts can detoxify the body from common pollution toxins. The common toxins especially benzene will be eliminated from your system via your urine if you make broccoli sprouts part of your regular meal.It is a known established fact that some toxins in the body can cause cancer, so it is very important that we find a way of removing them both from our body and the day to day environment if we can.Today, I want to go further on the research of using houseplants to further remove toxins from the household or office environment. Houseplants not only look good on your house and of course in your office, but they do also benefit the body system by helping to purify the air of common toxins. The result is that you breathe better cleaner air in the environment where it is placed.The most common household toxins are benzene, trichloroethylene, xylene, toluene, and formaldehyde, which are primarily in most cleaning products. We can also get toxins from the pollution that come in via the windows and doors, especially if we live close to motorways.Naturally, most of us prefer to open our windows for fresh air, what we don\u2019t want and we do get unfortunately from the fresh air that comes in is toxins from pollutions that are emitted from vehicles that drive past. Toxins from fumes emitted from types of machinery, if one is close by, as well as smokes from cigarettes, tobaccos and coal-burning stoves and other types of equipment.However, if we have to close our windows, especially in depth of winter, we can purify indoor air by using houseplants. Peace lily and pothos plant are good for this. NASA Research in collaboration with Associated Landscape Contractors of America discovered houseplants are good toxin filters.It is a known fact that plants do convert carbon dioxide that we breathe out into oxygen, through a process known as photosynthesis. Photosynthesis also involves the use of soil micro-organism. The Oxygen is then recycled for us to breathe in, and the process is repeated.For adequate protection, one will need one standard houseplant per one hundred square feet of living space. This translate to one standard houseplant in a room.I have already said it that nature has a way to nurture and protect mankind naturally from toxins, but most of us ignore these simple remedy, thinking we know better, or for a more complicated one like air purifiers.Naturally if one breathes in a cleaner and purer air, it balances and helps the body system, like clear the body air passage and including sleeping well. Here are top indoor plants that absorb toxins:Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum) \u2014 is cheap, easy to care for and will thrive easily either with direct sunlight or household light and can survive on end with little water. This means it will survive your long stay away. Peace Lily also absorb water from its environment to keep its soil moist. This can double as balancing the humidity of the room and or office environment.English Ivy (Hedera Helix) \u2014 is native to Europe and most Western Asia. It is easily maintained plant that adapts itself to the environment.Snake Plant\/Mother-in-law tongue (Sansevieria Trifaciata) \u2014 is one of the plants used in NASA Research, and like the Peace Lily requires minimal care and can sustain neglect for your long holiday away.Chinese Evergreen(Aglaonema) \u2014 thrives in medium to low indirect sunlight.Ficus (Ficus Benjamina) \u2014 is the official national tree of Bankok, and is known as evergreen weeping fig or in the shop as fig plant.Rubber Plant (Ficus Elastica) \u2014 is a species of the plant in the fig class, and is native to South East Asia.ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas Zamiifolia) \u2014 is a tropical perennial plant, native to Eastern and South Africa.Like its counterpart in the plant family, it does tolerate low light, needs less frequent flowering and very long-lasting.What are you then waiting for? As mentioned earlier, nature has given us adequate protection against what could be damaging to our health. And adding one or more of these plants to our homes and office environment is a surer way to protect ourselves from environmental toxins.Luckily these plants are cheap and are very affordable, so we don\u2019t have any excuse really. To your health always.Written byWritten by","17987":"I never intended to pursue residential treatment. I also never intended to be cripplingly depressed.Not just depressed \u2014 not just suicidal \u2014 but utterly listless, devoid of anything at all. I was an outline someone had neglected to color in, a bulleted list without any entries. At the age of 25, and after years of therapy and myriad other forms of treatment, I lacked not only the desire to live, but also the desire to exert any effort to end my life.Work was impossible. Maintaining relationships felt unnecessary. I wanted only to sleep. When even my dreams became tiresome, I wanted to cease existing without having to do anything about it. I wanted to wake up in space, drifting out and out until, like a dull and elderly star, I winked out.I resisted residential treatment for a variety of reasons. Primarily \u2014 and most familiarly \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to get better. Getting better meant putting in work, and time, and, most repugnant of all, effort, my nemesis after years and years of Trying Too Hard and Doing Too Much. Therapy was difficult enough, a once-weekly commitment to extracting my pain like infinite scarves from a magician\u2019s hat. Inpatient and outpatient treatment had been even harder. Residential treatment was as far up the treatment ladder as I could go: constant work, constant pain, the constant inability to ignore my problems.I didn\u2019t want to surround myself with strangers feeling as poorly as I was. One of my (ineffective) coping mechanisms is to mold myself like clay into whoever others want me to be, a more likable, more relatable avatar of my true self. Would I assume the role of caretaker when confronted by others who needed help? Would I take on their pain to avoid my own?Deep down, too, I was afraid of failure. I had been to the hospital; I had attended group therapy; I already knew countless skills and strategies and modalities, and I was still suffering. Residential treatment felt like my final destination, my elusive panacea, a last-ditch, crossed-fingers effort to cure me of my illness. What if it didn\u2019t work? What if I didn\u2019t feel better? What then?But the time was now: I had only several months left of being on my parents\u2019 insurance, and then I was on my own.One morning, I finally picked up the phone.The information available online for residential treatment somehow feels both inadequate and overwhelming. I had a base knowledge of the concept: go away somewhere for weeks or months or years; live under constant supervision by doctors and therapists; attend group therapy with others seeking treatment. But the information I found online suggested innumerable options. Did I want to live on a working farm, attending therapy in between time spent in a field or with animals? Did I want to live in an apartment with a roommate, or in a ward more similar to a hospital, or in a gorgeous mansion on the coast? I could attend treatment designed for my age group, my gender, my religious beliefs or lack thereof; each program boasted their own therapeutic acronyms and modalities, promising that their treatment would be the one to cure me once and for all. Different treatment facilities were located all over the country, even the world. It felt, sickly, like researching vacation destinations, but without the promise of rest and relaxation.I began to panic. Tasking an already depressed person with finding their own treatment \u2014 and, as I was quickly discovering, very expensive treatment \u2014 felt like a sick joke. I had no idea what I was looking for, what I needed. Any facility I called gave me a soothing-voiced representative who answered all of my questions, but these only then bred more. During each phone call, I took as many notes as I could, and then lay paralyzed in my bed, staring at the tapestry on my ceiling, for the rest of the day. I began to wonder if pursuing treatment was more trouble than it was ultimately worth.I almost gave up. My parents had what was universally dubbed \u201cgreat\u201d insurance \u2014 and yet each treatment facility representative still said, semi-apologetic, \u201cYour insurance will cover most of your time here.\u201d My parents informed me immediately that \u201cmost\u201d would not suffice: I needed to find a program that would cost us nothing. Over and over again I fielded calls, emails, instant messages from programs that promised to assist me before admitting I would have to pay thousands of dollars.A cold dread settled in my stomach. I wasn\u2019t going to get the help I desperately needed. I began entertaining the possibility of my own death, welcoming it like an unprepared hostess.When a treatment center on the west coast told me I would pay nothing, literally nothing, to be there for four weeks, I wept. My insurance would cover my entire stay. I had finally found a viable option to help me.To this day, I still think of those who aren\u2019t as fortunate, who have to take out exorbitant loans or pay thousands of dollars for themselves or their loved one to find the will to stay alive.I promised myself, when the initial call with my treatment center ended, that regardless of the outcome of my time there, I would never take it for granted.When I arrived on the coast, I stayed in a hotel that had a special rate for those attending the treatment facility. The next morning, two other young women my age sat awkwardly in the lobby with me, clutching purses and suitcases, eyes darting everywhere but at each other. When a grey-haired woman arrived and cheerfully told us she was taking us to the facility, we finally smiled wanly at each other. Relief and anxiety and skepticism all boiled together in the pit of my stomach. I swallowed it down.The facility itself looked like an office building, nestled inconspicuously between other businesses. Our living areas were several different houses, all within walking distance of the facility. I was surprised to find that no doctors or therapists lived with the patients in the gender-separated houses; we were trusted to arrive at the facility every day on time, to keep our living quarters clean, and to respect the space and each other. We even had days off, on which we were given free reign to explore the quaint town and surrounding area. It felt like what I imagined living in a sorority house was like, but without televisions or other \u201cdistractions\u201d that could detract from our healing.My schedule each day was a rigorous one. I would blearily roll out of bed and eat breakfast at around 8 am (lunch and dinner were provided by the facility; we were encouraged to purchase healthy breakfast foods and snacks). Then, all of us would gather in the lobby of the treatment facility, armed with bags of books and huge binders that contained our individual schedules and other helpful information. Each day consisted of four or five group therapy sessions that were structured as classes \u2014 one might be strictly on a type of therapy, like CBT or DBT, while others could be about cultivating healthy relationships, dealing with grief, tackling substance abuse, and more. I found myself in writing, art therapy, and even drama therapy groups.When not in \u201cclass,\u201d a patient could opt in to treatments like acupuncture, take advantage of the free usage of a nearby fitness center, or explore the town on foot (some patients had cars, but were forbidden to give rides to other patients). We also met weekly with one or two therapists, a nutritionist, and a psychiatrist, all of whom composed each patient\u2019s individual \u201ctreatment team.\u201dI was shocked at how quickly I adjusted to this schedule. Perhaps it felt like being back in college, where I had a set routine each day to adhere to; perhaps I was motivated by my roommates and the other patients who were quickly becoming friends. Either way, I dutifully got out of bed each morning, ate my healthy meals, even went several times to the fitness center. I was prescribed different medications and took them at the right times (the nurses always checked).And yet it didn\u2019t feel \u2014 right. My depression did not magically disappear the moment I stepped into the facility. I found myself performing, answering all the questions in \u201cclass,\u201d volunteering deeply personal stories. However, this was done all in the hopes that I would get the answers right and earn the attention and affection of the therapists and doctors \u2014 not to truly benefit and work on myself.My therapists began to realize this. \u201cYou\u2019re not getting the most out of this,\u201d they would say in our private sessions; I would grin and shrug and say that everything was going fine, just fine.But the constant therapy, the constant emphasis on Skills and Wellness and Doing Our Best, began \u2014 much to my chagrin, and surprise \u2014 to work. I began to be truly vulnerable in sessions, not just performatively. I reached into the cavern of my ribs and cracked them so that my heart was wide open. I talked about the recent heartbreak that had sent me spiraling \u2014 really talked about it, not just moody pining for the ex I still loved. I talked about my feelings of inadequacy in my life, my work, my art, the fear of mediocrity that haunted me with rattling chains. I talked about my relationships with friends and family, how I pushed people away who loved me and repeatedly reached for those who didn\u2019t. \u201cYou almost sound happy,\u201d my friends and family said tentatively after a week or two, when I called in the evenings. I almost was.More importantly, I listened. I heard my fellow patients, people of all ages from all walks of life, talk about abuse, addiction, death, devastation, pain I couldn\u2019t even begin to comprehend. At first, it shrunk me; familiar feelings of imposter syndrome hooked their sharp talons into me, hissed that I didn\u2019t deserve to be depressed, didn\u2019t belong in this place of healing when my problems were so insignificant. But, as it always does, compassion eventually helped me to grow, to stand even taller so that I could provide support to these new friends I had made. The regular practice of empathy helped me to heal.It wasn\u2019t easy. I was physically and emotionally exhausted every day. When the financial director sat me down and told me that my insurance had run out, and that I would have to leave a week and a half early, I panicked so thoroughly that I worried my progress would be erased. However, on the day that I left, I felt a peace I hadn\u2019t experienced for years.There\u2019s a video of me in the archives of their website \u2014 hair wet, no makeup, beaming at the camera regardless. \u201cI know things are still going to be difficult,\u201d I say, \u201cbut, for the first time in a long time, I feel hope.\u201dI\u2019m 26 now, nine months after my three and a half weeks on the coast. I know that depression and anxiety will remain with me for my whole life. I still attend therapy weekly and take a handful of medications. I still struggle with the mundanities of daily existence. I still wonder, sometimes, whether my life has any meaning, whether I deserve or want to be here, on this planet, carrying out an effortful life.Were it not for residential treatment, I am unsure if I would be here at all.I know for certain that the skills I cultivated there \u2014 the daily little steps I have to take, questions I need to ask myself, techniques to calm and soothe and motivate \u2014 have contributed to my continued success at staying alive. Cultivating a strict routine while in treatment helped me adapt back to a routine in my own life. I am able now to have healthy relationships, to hold down a job, to wrestle with my emotions and emerge victorious.I haven\u2019t been actively suicidal in these nine months.On my last day at the treatment facility, the patients and therapists all sat in a circle. One by one, they offered words of positivity and encouragement to me. I carry their words with me to this day \u2014 in my heart, and in my pocket, thanks to a booklet of index cards on which everyone then wrote a personalized message.And on one index card, I wrote, to myself, a reminder, a plea: \u201cLive. For real this time. Okay?\u201dI am.Written byWritten by","18023":"The exact cause of colorectal cancer remains uncertain, but there are risk factors strongly linked to the disease. These include:Today, we turn to 3 key things you can do that may reduce your risk of getting colorectal cancer.Think bacon, hot dogs, salami, and processed lunch meats. These are often preserved with sodium nitrite. When that substance hits our stomach acid during digestion, it may convert to nitrosamine, a known cancer-causing substance.Indeed, both high intake of nitrites and processed meats have been associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer compared to lower intakes. For those who enjoy processed meats, you may want to look for nitrite-free products, such as those marketed by the Applegate Farms brand.2. Eat more fruits and non-starchy vegetablesI guess my mom was right after all. Yes, you should consume more dark leafy greens, bell peppers, tomatoes, beets, squashes, carrots, asparagus, and cabbage. You get the picture. Such foods appear to reduce colon and rectal cancer incidence, although we don\u2019t have high-level evidence such as randomized trials (diet studies are notoriously challenging).We don\u2019t now why these foods provide protection, but it may be related to their antioxidant content. Or perhaps it\u2019s the fiber, or phytochemicals.Here\u2019s what we do know: Research has shown that people with diets highest in fruit and non-starchy veggies have a lower risk of developing digestive system cancers (including colon and rectal) compared to people whose diets contain the least amount of these foods.3. Get fiberGet fiber, preferably from whole foods. This non-digestible plant material appears to lower colon cancer risk. Traveling through the colon, fiber may trap dietary cancer-causing agents (carcinogens) in the stool, escorting them out of the body before they have the chance to cause cancer.Fiber also provides fuel to the bacteria that live within our guts. These microorganisms produce cancer-preventing (or rather, risk-reducing) byproducts called short chain fatty acids.Aim to increase your intake of fiber-rich foods such as beans, seeds, nuts, oatmeal and bran cereal. This approach is thought to be preferable to fiber-fortified, highly-processed foods because most of the available research investigating the chemoprotective effect of high fiber diets examined fiber from whole foods \u2014 which tends to differ from the laboratory-made types of fiber added to functional foods.While I am not an edamame fan (in spite of strong familial connections to Japan), it may provide benefit. Alternatively, try some dry roasted chickpeas or even popcorn! And if you eat oatmeal with nuts (instead of a packaged cereal bar) for breakfast, good for you.I\u2019m Dr. Michael Hunter.

Our aim was to walk the trails in Joshua Tree National Park near Palm Springs, California. We flew to Las Vegas, rented a car, and then drove four hours to our Airbnb near Palm Springs. The beautiful ranch home we rented was at the end of a mile-long dirt road in a desert valley. We got out of the car, looked around and said, \u201cThis is awesome.\u201dWe could see the sunrise over the mountains each morning from our bed. We watched the sunset from our patio, waiting for the night sky to brighten and shine full of stars. \u201cAwesome.\u201dThe first morning we walked outside and saw the blue sky for the first time in weeks. It was so quiet I could feel the silence and peace flow through me like warm honey. \u201cAwesome.\u201dWe walked in the National Park awestruck by the beauty of the mountains some even snowcapped, the Joshua Trees unique to the area, and fresh mountain air.An Encounter with a LocalThe closest grocery store, Vons, was a thirty-minute drive. We needed some supplies. (Since we were out west, I called our groceries supplies. It felt more cowboy.) At the checkout, we stacked our food and beverages on the counter. The checkout lady was older and not the overly friendly type [\u201cHi! My name is Rhonda! Did you find everything you needed?\u201d] She was all business and a little dour. When she finished ringing everything up, she looked at Mary and said, \u201cDo you have a Vons Club Card?\u201d It felt like a cross-examination.\u201cNo. We\u2019re visitors,\u201d Mary said.The lady starred at us, hesitated a moment, and then reached under the counter and gave Mary a Vons Club Card. \u201cHere. Use this now. I don\u2019t care what you do with it afterward. You saved $14 on your bill.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d we said in our kindest and most genuine midwestern voices.\u201cHarrumph.\u201d She grunted, and we left.Out in the parking lot as we packed away our supplies we looked at each other and laughed. \u201cThat lady was awesome!\u201dAwe comes in different packages. Sometimes it is the breathtaking beauty of a desert sunrise or a sky full of stars. Sometimes it creeps up on you like the stillness and silence I felt on our first morning. And sometimes it is just an ordinary old package wrapped in brown paper or burlap like the checkout lady at Vons. But in every case, it is a wonder-full moment that takes you outside of yourself.Awe-Deprived PeopleThe danger is that the \u201cE-World\u201d we inhabit, filled with social media posts and electronic screens, is making us awe-deprived. We are becoming more individualistic, more sarcastic, and more hyper-vigilant and so less connected to people. Sometimes the problems we see in the world seem so overwhelming that we think, \u201cwhat difference would my little actions make on anything?\u201d Yet there is a lot of research that suggests that small steps can have a major impact on our own well-being and the well-being of others. (Why Do We Feel Awe, Greater Good Magazine, May 10, 2016, Dacher Keltner)What is awe?Awe is the feeling we get in the presence of something vast that challenges our understanding of the world, like looking up at millions of stars in the night sky or marveling at the birth of a child.Why practice awe?Their research suggests that \u201cexperiences of awe may have long-term positive effects on our minds, bodies, and social connections.\u201d Here\u2019s a list of some positive effects:\u00a7 We feel kinder.\u00a7 We feel happier.\u00a7 We feel more curious and creative. (I enjoyed drawing and writing out in our desert Airbnb and took two afternoons to finish a simple sketch)\u00a7 We feel smaller and humbled in the presence of something bigger than ourselves.\u00a7 We feel healthier. Awe may help us reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, and autoimmune disease by lowering our levels of cytokines, which elicit an inflammatory response linked to these problems.\u00a7 We feel more alert.How do I cultivate awe?Experiences of awe surround us every day but it means stepping back a moment, stepping outside of the thought wall we erect that keeps us from noticing what is always available to us anytime here and now. It is the practice of noticing, saying to yourself, \u201cFor the next few moments, I will look for something that pleases me.\u201dPRACTICEHere\u2019s a simple exercise from the Greater Good Science Center that you can do anywhere (you feel safe) and anytime. It\u2019s called:AN AWE WALKIt is a matter of intention, reflection, and savoring that makes the Awe Walk most impactful. With the right outlook, we can find awe in almost any environment, turning a mundane experience into a flight of inspiration and wonder. It is most likely to occur in places that have two key features: physical vastness and novelty. These could include natural settings like a hiking trail lined with tall trees, or urban settings like at the top of a skyscraper.You\u2019re more likely to feel awe in a new place, where the sights and sounds are unfamiliar to you. That said, some places never seem to get old.No matter where you are, the key is to be in the right frame of mind. This practice helps you get there \u2014 to turn an ordinary walk into a series of awe-inspiring moments, filled with delightful surprises.The WALK1. To get started, turn off your cell phone. Cell phones (and other gadgets) can distract and draw your attention away from what\u2019s happening around you. Even better, don\u2019t bring your phone with you at all so it won\u2019t tempt you to check it.2. During your walk, try to approach what you see with fresh eyes, imagining that you\u2019re seeing it for the first time. Then follow these steps:3. Take a deep breath in. Count to six as you inhale and six as you exhale. Feel the air move through your nasal passages and listen to your breath. Come back to this breath throughout the walk.4. As you begin walking, feel your feet on the ground and listen to the surrounding sounds. Shift your awareness now so you are open to what is around you, to things that are vast, unexpected things that surprise and delight.5. Take another deep breath in. Again, count to six as you inhale and six as you exhale. Let your attention be open in exploration for what inspires awe in you. Is it a wide landscape? The small patterns of light and shadow? Let your attention move from the vast to the small.6. Continue your walk and, every so often, bring your attention back to your breath. Count to six as you inhale and six as you exhale. Notice \u2014 really notice \u2014 the multitude of sights, sounds, smells, and other sensations that are dancing through your awareness, undetected.Once you get in the habit of taking walks like this, you may find how often you have opportunities to experience awe \u2014 they are infinite.As you move through your day, note the moments that bring you wonder, that give you goosebumps. These are your opportunities for awe. They may be in city areas, in front of art, listening to music, or connecting with others. Find your awe moments and listen to them; see where they guide you. (Awe Walk, Greater Good Science Center, Berkeley California)Take a moment today to step back and notice moments of beauty and kindness. See if you can surprise yourself at what you find. You will be better for it, becoming more humble and acting with more kindness, and so will the rest of us.We share our daily distribution list, featured stories, and progress updates from our publication.\u00a0Take a lookWritten byWritten by","18309":"The Queen dusts off her old talking mirror and asks it to name the fairest woman in the land.

Goop was founded in 2008 and was built on the premise that almost everything we come into contact with in our day to day lives is toxic.I\u2019m not just talking about toxic in the sense of ingredients. I found numerous claims from Gwyneth where she said that we need to cleanse our lives of any toxic energy that may be lingering from old relationships or situations.That means your bras and underwear might hold toxic energy from lovers past\u2026so you should just get rid of them\/burn them.I\u2019m sorry but If I had gotten rid of all of my undergarments after every relationship I would have been going commando for a long time because that is not cheap.Almost every product that I looked claimed to be a cure. Some of the products said that they would cure depression and anxiety with there is no medical backing or truth behind it.I take issue with a product claiming to \u201ccure\u201d things that can be debilitating to people especially because it could prevent them from seeking out meditation that is proven to help with those symptoms.Next, I read about the jade eggs. Now, they may look like something that you can buy at any crystal\/gem store in the world but apparently her jade eggs are \u201cmagical.\u201dThe eggs, which retail for $55, can \u201chelp cultivate sexual energy, increase orgasm, balance the cycle, stimulate key reflexology around vaginal walls, tighten and tone, prevent uterine prolapse, increase control of the whole perineum and bladder, develop and clear chi pathways in the body, intensify feminine energy, and invigorate our life force,\u201d -The OutlineI don\u2019t even know what most of that means but it sounds like a lot of buzz words and it turns out that the jade egg specifically was discovered to be dangerous if used incorrectly.\u201cDr. Jen Gunter, a gynecologist, did a review of the product, and his report went viral. He suggested that using the jade egg could result in a toxic shock syndrome. The investigation involved a total of 110 products that Goop claimed to be health-related, and only 10 had valid statements.\u201d -TheBlastThis isn\u2019t the first time that a company makes false claims and sells overpriced products to people that can do more harm than good and it certainly won\u2019t be the last.Because the companies' claims as they are so misleading and could actually be dangerous to the public there has been legal action taken against them.In fact, Gwyneth was sued in 2018 for $145,000 dollars for marketing products with claims that were completely unsubstantial.However, regardless of the bad publicity and evidence to back up that most of the products they sell don\u2019t do what they claim it will\u2026 Goop is still doing well.Personally, I don\u2019t have $150 to spend on an ounce of face oil that is supposed to stop me from aging or a gemstone that will help my aura so I\u2019m most likely never going to try one of these products for myself.Vaginal eggs and toxic energy aren\u2019t common topics in my industry.

Nevertheless, we are living in an age where the pressure of working and personal to-do lists put aside the time for gym sessions or any fitness activity on that matter. We tend to substitute physical activity with more important things like staying late at work to finish some tasks, or catching on the time with family or rushing through to meet a long time no-see friends during the weekends.At the same time, the global mHealth market value is growing each year. It\u2019s expected to reach $511 billion in 2026 while the competition becomes fierce every day. Ironically enough, the recent studies show that over 60 percent of American adults don\u2019t get the recommended amount of physical activity and over 25 percent of adults are not active at all. Many reasons contribute to this. For example, the lack of free time, childcare responsibilities, the gym is always busy, you can\u2019t afford sports classes or you have a lack of confidence.Surely you can think of millions of reasons why it\u2019s not rational to sign up for gym membership. But, what if you could improve your health with minimum effort and what is more important to buy products depending on how well your \u201ctraining\u201d was today? Sounds great, doesn\u2019t it? All you need to do is to download Stepler.So, what is Stepler? How will it help to motivate you to stay fit? How to create an app from scratch? What are the main tech challenges with the developing step tracker apps? Answers to all of these questions and even more you will find below.This is the eternal question of every person who decides to step on the road of digital health and wellness.Recent studies show that over 60 percent of American adults don\u2019t get the recommended amount of physical activity and over 25 percent of adults are not active at all. As a result, 27.5% of all adults worldwide are not physically active. Other statistics stress that only 1 out of 3 children are physically active. Perhaps, this is because children spend more than 7 hours per day in front of a screen of their mobile phones and tablets.Even though we know all the positive reasons why we should stay physically healthy, still sometimes we need to put some effort to sign up for a gym class or put ourselves together to do a morning running session. From the hectic schedule to not seeing results, there are various reasons why people don\u2019t exercise. Let\u2019s briefly discuss why is it so?The lack of free time\u201cBut I simply do not have enough free time\u201d \u2014 this is the first thing that came to your mind once the topic of fitness pops up. It\u2019s a fact, that modern society in comparison with society even 30 years ago is tighter on the ability to have free time. We are living in the swirl of constant to-do lists, where multitasking and the ability to keep a finger on the pulse are must-have skills. The reason for this is the development of advanced technologies, gadgets and modern tech solutions that provide us with a myriad of opportunities on a daily basis. So, we simply can\u2019t miss the opportunity to catch on the latest trends for your job or perhaps start your own small business. Therefore, the idea of exercise routine might fade away compared to the more important goals.Can\u2019t afford a gym\/sport class membershipSurely the price of the gym membership will depend on many factors. For example, the state\/region, location, the monthly or yearly commitment, type of classes (group or individual, yoga or bootcamps), additional convenience like pool and sauna or option 24hr fitness, etc.. Whether the gym is average or elite the cost for a gym membership can vary from $10 to $100. So, probably not all young families or teenagers can afford it.You have childcare responsibilitiesCooking, cleaning, grocery shopping, having a carpool duty and it\u2019s only a small portion of the daily activity of every parent. Therefore, exercising with kids requires planning, which is not always possible to arrange. With school or after school activities and sports, kids and teens can have schedules as busy as their parents. Therefore, making sure the kids get to practice on time some parents sacrifice their own time to contribute to their health and wellness.The lack of confidenceNot feeling secure in the gym due to worrying about how you look and what others think is another crucial reason why people tend to neglect exercising. The lack of confidence may come from expecting too much too soon. In that case, if you go from no exercise to hitting the gym seven days a week, you\u2019re bound to feel burned out. Since not every sports activity is for everyone, it\u2019s important to find a routine that fits your personality and lifestyle.The gym is too busyWhat could be more frustrating than a crowded gym? In the recent survey, people identify that substituting equipment for the one which is free is the most annoying thing that influences their willingness to visit the gym. The \u2018jams\u2019 in the gym usually happen in the morning and evening when people visit it before or after their working hours. Still, it doesn\u2019t defeat the reason why you should waste your time in the gym standing in lines.Surely you can think of millions of reasons why it\u2019s not rational to sign up for gym membership. But, what if you could improve your health with minimum effort and what is more important to buy products depending on how well your \u201ctraining\u201d was today? Sounds great, doesn\u2019t it? It all will be possible with downloading the activity tracking apps, for example.So, let\u2019s discuss one of the wellness step counter apps as an example of a simple but effective tool on how to battle the lack of motivation and get fit.You may have noticed that the notions of fitness and wellness are usually used together. And while we all know what fitness apps are, let\u2019s take a minute to find out what does wellness means.The search query \u201cwellness meaning\u2019 suggests that it is the state of being in good mental and physical health. Wellness can be achieved by surrounding yourself with positive and supportive people, finding activities that provide you with a sense of purpose and connectedness, taking care of your nutrition and what is more important is paying attention to your physical development and exercise on the regular basis.That\u2019s exactly why Stepler was created for \u2014 to boost your motivation to stay fit. The application tracks your steps and converts them into points. These points you can exchange in the app for real goods and services. Easy as that. Currently, the app is available on AppStore and GooglePlay only for Sweden, however, the team is working to expand it worldwide.Why is it the best app on the market? Simply because you can take care of your health and buy whatever products you like. All within one application. Stepler is a new vision of a healthy lifestyle and a new step in getting benefits from your activity tracking sessions.We suggest you see how Stepler approaches the most common reasons why people do not exercise:The lack of free time -> The step counter app saves tons of your time while contributing to your healthy lifestyle. We mentioned that scheduling the extra time for the gym routine or running session sounds unrealistic, nowadays. But spending a lot of time exercising doesn\u2019t mean it will be effective. So, why don\u2019t we concentrate on simple exercise that we all do every day \u2014 walking. And, if you look more closely at how you spend your time, you might realize that we walk more than you thought. Put your application to track the taken steps. Keep a calendar on your achievements so you can track your progress and stay motivated.Can\u2019t afford a gym membership -> It\u2019s free of charge, plus you can get real products by exchanging your earned points from the walking. There\u2019s no reason you have to join the gym to exercise, but if you\u2019re determined to leave the house to work out, there are more affordable options such as long and intensive walking. Such an activity can be used for core work, cardio, and even weight training. All you need for this accessible workout is a good pair of shoes and a walking app. Therefore, without any equipment, you can get a great workout.Moreover, you not only save your money but also have the opportunity to buy real goods and services. The app will track the steps for you and automatically convert them into points. These points can be exchanged for any product or service from the in-app catalog. There is a wide selection of goods that you can choose from since the Stepler team cooperates with top labels and brands to provide the users with useful and interesting product options.You have childcare responsibilities. -> Walk with the kids and cultivate a healthy relationship with the fitness activity from a young age. Just because you have carpool duty or need to make sure your teen gets to practice on time doesn\u2019t mean you have to neglect your own fitness goals. In that case, exercise can be a great activity for the whole family. Making time for a workout doesn\u2019t just benefit your health; it also sets a good example for your kids. Moreover, put on the tracking app when the kids are napping or you\u2019re waiting for dinner to cook. If children are old enough, invite your kids to be part of your routine and take them along on your daily walk.The lack of confidence. -> Boost your confidence by walking, staying fit and being motivated by buying goods as a self-treat. With Stepler you should not be worried about how you look and what the other will think. Be in your natural habitat while taking care of your health. Build your confidence step by step. Moreover, you have the opportunity to treat yourself with a new purchase. Purchasing different products by the points you\u2019ve earned could motivate you significantly. So, every time you\u2019ll take Stepler in your hands and press the button to track the steps \u2014 you already can think of your next purchase for your friends, family or yourself.The gym is too busy. -> Walk tracker is a great workout routine and substitution for a crowded gym. The greatest thing about the step counter is that you don\u2019t have any equipment at all \u2014 just your mobile phone and intention to make you a more healthy person.As a result, among the best walking apps, Stepler works as a trigger to take care of your health and wellness while purchasing real products for your pleasure.The co-founder and CEO of Stepler, Niklas Frisk commented on how exactly the app will contribute to the current market of mHealth:Niklas Frisk: \u201cI think many see Stepler as an alternative to the gym card you carry in your pocket. Far too many give away their New Year\u2019s resolutions of a healthier lifestyle for different reasons \u2014 lack of time, money, motivation, etc. So, Stepler is a cost-effective alternative that is actually complied with. It\u2019s an easy and convenient app to use on a daily basis. Moreover, companies see Stepler as a fun platform where they meet their target audience in a playful and innovative way.\u201dTaking into account the growing percentage of the digital mHealth market, it is clear that fitness and wellness apps would have a great demand among the customers of all the age in the future. So, if you want to start a small business or develop a mobile app for medical, healthcare and wellness industries \u2014 then let\u2019s take a look at how to build a step-tracking app. Based on personal experience, the 2muchcoffee team will briefly discuss all the necessary aspects of the building the wellness step tracker app.A fitness app or sports tracker, a walking app or step tracker \u2014 regardless of the name Stepler will motivate you to stay fit while exchanging the points for any product you like. Stepler automatically counts your steps, walking, and running distances. And, if you have an Apple Watch, it automatically tracks all of your activity data. So, it\u2019s time to look at the idea behind the application and what tech challenges were faced by our devs team.The idea. We believe that the beauty and convenience of any mobile app lies in its simplicity. Therefore, the key advantage of the Stepler is clear and simple user-interface and functionality. The mobile app was created to simplify the lives of the users and not vice versa.One should take into account, that the rapid growth of the mHealth market and the consequent high demand for feature-rich fitness apps created a tendency to produce feature creep apps. The apps with an excessive number of features that are not necessarily useful for targeted consumers. As a result, the market is full of applications doing multiple things like cardio tracking, fitness activity tracking, calorie calculating, providing workout exercise templates and many others.Having such an app, a user could find it quite confusing to navigate such a complex feature flow. Instead of it, users are willing to use simple apps with the focus on the specific activity. Therefore, simplicity in functionality will be more appealing to your targeted audiences and potentially create an emotional connection with the app.Moreover, simplicity and clarity can even help your product to survive severe competition in the mHealth market. How? A user or a new customer should know what exactly to expect before downloading the app. In the myriad of different mHealth apps (precisely, step tracking ones) your application should stand out. In this case, balancing simplicity with functionality is the foundation of sophistication of mobile app development.In this regard, Stepler is focusing on one particular goal and feature \u2014 user motivation to move. While the simplicity and functionality reflection in its main advantages, such as:We asked co-founders of Stepler to elaborate on what was the inspiration to create an app and its main advantages form his point of view:Niklas Frisk: \u201cThe idea was born when we ourselves lacked the motivation for exercise and movement. At the same time, nowadays it\u2019s difficult to solve the life puzzle with family, work, and training. So Stepler was the answer to several questions. Regarding the main advantages, of the app, I would say that downloading the app is an extremely low threshold. Everybody walk, who wouldn\u2019t wanna get fit and get paid at the same time? The timing is also a factor. Plus, the app (even if not directly) contributes to sustainability, climate, and a healthy lifestyle, which are on everybody\u2019s lips today.\u201dTechnical challenges and solutions. Stepler was developed to count the steps. And while it may sound simple on the surface, in reality, there are a lot of pitfalls that need to be solved. The development of step counting apps could be quite tricky \u2014 both the storage of the huge amount of data and synchronization could be the most difficult challenges even for the experienced devs.Check out the other tech challenges that might pop up during the development process:The tech stack we used: React Native, MongoDB, Zendesk API, Rabbitmq, Nestjs, Sentry.io, Firebase Analytics, Apple health integration, Google Fit integration.Our team, as well as the Stepler team, are proud of the result and the quality of the work we did. We provided a full cycle of development from idea to release. Highload project with thousands of users is never easy to handle, especially since each user has to synchronize huge amounts of steps\/data. Therefore, it needs to be highlighted that we are proud to find solutions and manage the real-time data updating and create a simple but elegant mobile app for step counting.The product perspective. Millions of people have already verified the fact that Stepler is the best app in the market niche. The application became the number one in Sweden and was mentioned in the local newspaper as the most rapidly developed startup in the fitness and wellness mHealth market.Based on such success, the leaders of Stepler commented on the scaling plans for the next 5 years:Niklas Frisk: \u201cWe start out in Sweden where we expect to grow to 250K+ users before we expand to Europe and the USA. We have a great ambition with Stepler and sees a market across all 7 continents.\u201dAmong the best walking apps, Stepler works as a trigger to take care of your health and wellness while purchasing real products for your pleasure. Don\u2019t wait for tomorrow to pay attention to your health. Start moving today, collect points and get great discounts in the shops.In 2020, being fit sounds easier than it looks. Why? Simply because with the innovation in healthcare the market became overcrowded with the feature creep mobile apps. Consequently, such applications are stuffed with unnecessary features. Therefore, being the user of such an app and having to navigate all functionality of the app might be frustrated and overwhelmed.At 2muchcoffee we believe that the mobile app should be user-friendly and elegant in its functionality and design. That is why we value the unique idea and product potential. Developed from scratch \u2014 it\u2019s no brainer, that Stepler was our favorite project to work on.Stepler tracks your steps and converts them into points. These points you can exchange in the app for real goods and services. As a result, among the best walking apps, Stepler works as a trigger to take care of your health and wellness while purchasing real products for your pleasure. It is considered the best app on the market due to its simplicity and functionality that creates a sophisticated user experience.Walking app, step tracker or step counter app, best pedometer, a fitness app or sports tracker \u2014 call it whatever you like, but Stepler is about to rock your world!See for yourself by downloading the app (AppStore, GooglePlay).Originally published at https:\/\/2muchcoffee.com on March 18, 2020.Written byWritten by","19093":"My hands are clean. I\u2019m the kind of man who scrubs in like a surgeon before eating chicken wings for dinner. From the moment I step onto the New York City subway, a petri dish on wheels, I think of nothing but the moment I can lather up and rinse off with hot water.I am constantly washing my hands, like an obsessive Pontius Pilate. It helps to see the world as I see it: splattered with microscopic death.So it\u2019s a nasty surprise to learn that I\u2019m in the minority. According to a study cited by the Centers For Disease Control, a horrifying 69% (nice) of men reported they don\u2019t wash their hands. Yes, that\u2019s right, the vast majority of dudes don\u2019t wash after using the toilet.That means almost 7 out of 10 men walk around giving high-fives with hands soaked in invisible human juices. Apparently, I have shaken hands with billions of fecal molecules. And so have you.I accept that my gender has its unsavory habits. While I often criticize and mock men don\u2019t think for a moment I\u2019m above it all.I have been known to wear the same pair of socks two days in a row. I eat week-old Thai food takeout. I don\u2019t always clip my toenails. I\u2019m gross. Pull my finger.But, my dudes, wash your hands. Please. Wash them after manipulating your genital organs. Wash them after using public transportation. Wash them, regularly, because you are a human being interacting with other human beings and human beings, while sometimes very nice, are also autonomous biological weapons. We are covered in germs and thankfully, germs hate soap.I feel like I\u2019ve been training my whole life for the coronavirus pandemic, the flu-like illness that is spreading around the world at an alarming rate and is especially dangerous to the elderly and those with weak immune systems. I really don\u2019t want to contribute to anyone\u2019s anxieties about this unfolding story but I think it\u2019s fair to say the COV-19 outbreak is not as bad as it seems and is also far worse than we\u2019re being told.In addition to washing my hands, I use to be an avid hand sanitizer user but that was before the precious goo started to sell-out. True story: a man tried to sell me a one-ounce bottle of Purell for eight dollars on the streets of Manhattan this week like it was a drug. I should have asked him how much for a squirt.The majority of infectious disease experts say the best way to protect yourself from the virus is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Some of those healthcare experts suggest singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d twice while washing hands in order to completely rinse away germs. Instead of singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d I sing two choruses of Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cDark Horse.\u201dSo you wanna play with magic?Boy, you should know what you\u2019re fallin\u2019 forBaby, do you dare to do this?\u2019Cause I\u2019m coming at you like a dark horseAre you ready for, ready forA perfect storm, perfect storm?\u2019Cause once you\u2019re mine, once you\u2019re mineThere\u2019s no going backI have been religiously washing my hands for my entire life. I wash them like I\u2019m going to win a prize. I\u2019m so good at it I should teach a free workshop. The first lesson? Washing your hands, even if you\u2019re a healthy young man, is a good way to protect friends and family. So be a hero. The coronavirus is especially dangerous to senior citizens and those with underlying medical conditions. Not to mention the uninsured. If you don\u2019t want to wash your hands for yourself do it for the vulnerable people in your life.Wait, I\u2019ve changed my mind. Do it for your loved ones but also do it for me, because, good God, you just went to the bathroom.Written byHumungus' newsletter is pretty self-explanatory.

SmithWhen Stephanie Purcell decided to change careers from marketing to production, she soon realised that there weren\u2019t many job opportunities in Omaha, Nebraska, where she lived with her husband. So she moved to Los Angeles \u2014 and her husband stayed in Omaha, where his career in IT security was skyrocketing. Living in two separate states \u201cinitially wasn\u2019t something we thought we would be doing long-term,\u201d Purcell tells Refinery29. But, two and a half years later, she and her husband are still living apart. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to give up his dream, and he didn\u2019t want me to give up mine,\u201d she says. \u201cSo we started this lifestyle of living in two different places.\u201dSociologists call relationships like Purcell and her husband\u2019s \u201c Living Apart Together\u201d or LAT relationships. Research shows that the typical LAT couple is over fifty. After living alone for a time \u2014 perhaps after being widowed or divorced \u2014 they realise they thrive when they have independence and personal space, and they don\u2019t want to give that up when they begin a committed relationship. But experts say that LAT relationships are on the rise among millennials, thanks to women\u2019s increased independence, the rapidly globalising job market, and the normalisation of other types of \u201cnon-traditional\u201d relationship styles, such as polyamory. As Purcell says, \u201cIt\u2019s not what our parents did or what our friends are doing. But it\u2019s what\u2019s best for us.\u201dAnnie Cox began creating a LAT dating app called Apartner in 2016. Although she is a boomer, she has noticed millennials\u2019 interest in LAT relationships and attributes it in part to the fact that women have more financial independence than they did when she was young. \u201cYounger people are realising that they don\u2019t have to do what we felt we had to do: get married, have children, and live together,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, women in particular are highly aware of their ability to secure themselves financially.\u201d She points out that data shows that women are marrying and having children significantly later, if they decide to marry or have children at all. \u201cThey are focusing on education and career, and if they want to get married and have children \u2014 and many of them don\u2019t \u2014 they can do so later on,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd they\u2019re no longer being ostracised by society for that choice.\u201dLinda Breault, who co-authored the book Living Apart Together \u2014 A New Possibility for Loving Couples, adds, \u201cWomen now are much better educated, more affluent, and better aware of their options than any other generation before. So many now have successful professional or semi-professional careers and are financially independent. That makes a difference.\u201dDue to the rise of social media and the increasingly global nature of the job market, couples may find that their career paths take them to separate states or even countries. Sam Laliberte and her boyfriend began a long-distance relationship three years ago, after he moved from Toronto to San Francisco for work. Eventually, her boyfriend quit his job, but the couple didn\u2019t move in together. Instead, \u201cwe both became remote, digital nomad, freelancer types,\u201d Laliberte says. And like the ambitious millennials they are, they even collaborated on a project for long-distance couples together: The #LDR Activity Book.Now, Laliberte lives in Toronto, and her boyfriend lives across the country in Vancouver. \u201cWe have the opportunity to live together in the same city full-time, and we\u2019ve chosen not to,\u201d she explains. They have many reasons to live apart: they each prefer their chosen city, have a community of family and friends where they live, and find that it works best for their careers. Laliberte says they\u2019d be open to considering cohabiting it in the right circumstances, especially if they have children together, but not anytime soon. \u201cRight now, I like living here, he likes living there, and it works,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have no end date in mind, and we have no intentions of breaking up.\u201d Channa Bromley, Lead Coach for Relationship Hero, says many millennial couples are choosing to live apart for similar reasons. \u201cIt is becoming a lot more common because the world is becoming so much more accessible than what it used to be,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have people going to different universities and staying together, and when we get promotions and job opportunities, they might not be in the same city as our partner.\u201dBromley also sees a connection between the rise of LAT relationships among millennials and the normalisation of polyamorous and open relationships. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a bit of a stigma doing something that\u2019s not the status quo, but there\u2019s definitely a rise in people designing their own relationships now,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople are beginning to understand that there isn\u2019t a \u2018right\u2019 and a \u2018wrong\u2019 way to have a relationship.\u201d Linda, who asked to be called by her first name only, says that she and her husband, who live in separate apartments in Chicago, have found acceptance in the polyamorous community, even though they\u2019re not currently polyamorous themselves. \u201cMost people we know think we\u2019re trailblazing, but we don\u2019t mean to be.\u201dSam Branman suggests that LAT relationships may be more accepted among the queer community. He and his husband are what he calls \u201cNew York long-distance, but not real long-distance\u201d \u2014 he lives in Park Slope in Brooklyn while his husband lives six miles away, in the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood of Manhattan. When I ask if he\u2019s faced any pushback on his relationship from his friends and family, which many of the opposite-sex couples I talked to expressed, he jokes, \u201cHonestly, I barely interact with straight people, so no.\u201d Branman is a designer and his husband does drag, so they both need a lot of space to store their stuff \u2014 plus, they just prefer their own neighbourhoods and apartments. \u201cA big part of it is my job,\u201d Branman explains. Because he works from home and has \u201ca massive amount of sewing stuff,\u201d it doesn\u2019t make sense for him to move into his husband\u2019s small apartment. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to live in Hell\u2019s Kitchen,\u201d he adds.Some parents find that LAT relationships make the most sense not just for themselves but for their children. Jay, who asked to be credited by his first name only, says that he and his girlfriend are both single parents, and while they\u2019ve discussed living together, they\u2019ve decided against it. \u201cWe both have children in different schools and it would have been too disruptive, plus we both like our autonomy,\u201d he explains. And while both Purcell and Laliberte mentioned that they may move in with their partners if they have children together, Relationship Hero\u2019s Bromley says that isn\u2019t the case for all LAT couples. \u201cWhat a child needs is to know they\u2019re loved, they\u2019re supported, they\u2019re encouraged,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can be empowering for the child to see their parents designing a life that works for them \u2014 and it shows them they don\u2019t need to stick to rigid societal norms.\u201d Finances are also a factor \u2014 \u201cThis is not a choice unless you have financial independence,\u201d Breault, author of Living Apart Together \u2014 A New Possibility for Loving Couples, says. But while you might think that LAT relationships are automatically more expensive than cohabiting, that\u2019s not always the case \u2014 Branman, for example, says that because he has roommates and his husband\u2019s apartment is rent-controlled, they wouldn\u2019t save much by living together.While LAT couples \u2014 particularly older ones \u2014 have been the subject of some newspaper and magazine articles in the past few years, most recently in the Wall Street Journal, the term \u201cLAT\u201d is still not very well known. Cox, who created the Apartners dating app, says that she saw a spike in interest in LAT relationships when Gwyneth Paltrow announced that she and her husband Brad Falchuk were living apart ( they have since announced they\u2019re moving in together). When I\u2019ve brought up LAT style relationships with friends and on social media, people have mentioned two celebrity couples: Woody Allen and Mia Farrow, who famously lived on opposite sides of Central Park in the \u201980s and early \u201990s (until their romance ended disastrously when Allen began a relationship Farrow\u2019s daughter Soon-Yi Previn and allegedly sexually abused his and Farrow\u2019s daughter Dylan), and Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton, who lived and co-parented in adjoining houses before amicably separating in 2014. In 2019, the Big Bang Theory actress Kaley Cuoco made headlines when she announced that she and her husband Karl Cook didn\u2019t live together, though the couple have since moved in together after two years of living apart.Very few people in LAT relationships actually know the term LAT \u2014 even most experts I talked to said that they\u2019d learned the term after beginning their research. The lack of awareness of the term, Cox says, can make finding someone who wants the same type of relationship harder. \u201cPeople will say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be with somebody all the time,\u2019 or \u2018I want my own personal space,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ve been married before and I don\u2019t want a partner around all the time,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what to call that type of relationship.\u201d She believes that as awareness of LAT relationships grows, more people will choose to be in them. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know that they want it, because they don\u2019t know what to call it.\u201dOf course, not everyone will thrive in a LAT relationship. Bromley suggests that those who are interested in a LAT relationship try it out in the short term \u2014 signing a one-month lease instead of a one-year lease, for example \u2014 before going further. \u201cThis will work amazingly for some, and for others it will detrimental,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no right or wrong, just whether it\u2019s right for each individual person and relationship.\u201d Everyone I spoke with stressed that, for a LAT relationship to work, prioritising communication is necessary, as is a sense of personal independence. As Purcell says, \u201cWe always joke that we\u2019re together not because we have to be, but because we choose to be. We\u2019re together because we like the other person, not because we need the other person.\u201dOriginally published at https:\/\/refinery29.com.Written byWritten by","19276":"How have you been feeling?

Colds and allergies part of life? Not sleeping well \u2014 maybe even feel you are not functioning well. It\u2019s normal, right?! And amplified even more with today\u2019s stress. Isn\u2019t this part of the journey of getting\u2026old\u2026If you are someone who agrees with this, I have something to share with you.As a board certified health and wellness coach, also certified in functional medicine, I have learned that food is not just like medicine, it is medicine.Let me repeat that \u2014 Food is medicine \u2014Yes, this is what *functional medicine doctors through research and from experiences with patients have proven. *Mark Hyman is one of these doctors and as a public figure he is sharing his knowledge.I first heard the term Regeneratarian in February from Dr. Hyman. A name (finally) for the lifestyle I have been following for the past five years!So what is a Regeneratarian? Here is what Dr. Hyman states:In a world that seems out of control, here is where we can take some control. Make some changes that would be beneficial for our health and for our planet.Dr. Hyman shares that being a Regeneratarian makes you:With all the above benefits in mind, I started a journey to eat healthier and live a cleaner, green life\u2026\u2026I eliminated processed foods, fast food, gluten, dairy and sugar. I focus on real, whole foods choosing better quality meats\/poultry and organic products. This includes skin and body care, household cleaners and laundry products. I drink organic coffee (black) and filtered (not bottled) water.It might look like I have given up so much. In reality, I have gained so much!I don\u2019t have to think about what I am going to eat (all those food choices) and I look at food as fuel. My weight is under control. I sleep better, wake up not feeling groggy. My memory is better, I am more focused and clear headed. I\u2019m more balanced and my mood is better.And I haven\u2019t been sick in years \u2014 before I was sick quite often. I feel better (when you eat crap, you feel like crap). Acid reflux, gas and bloating are no more.An added bonus, and something I didn\u2019t expect. In living this cleaner way, I actually lost inches in my lower half! Not weight \u2014 inches bringing me down a size. Could it be less toxins from the chemicals and less inflammation from sugar? I am not a doctor nor scientist, so I cannot say.What I can say is that I am not following the crowd with the thoughts that getting older means falling apart. I feel healthier, and stronger.This being said, it is not my place to recommend that anyone make changes based on how I live. However, I do wish to share my experience and what I have learned from Dr. Hyman\u2019s research.I\u2019d like to include a few of my fellow writers who have noticed the food connection:Nicole Linke shares this thought:Your brain and your gut are continually communicating with each other.And this from Joan Kent, PhD:Avoid junky carbs, like sugar and white flour. Limit alcohol. These trigger high insulin release and inflammation.Including also another article I wrote:In case you are not familiar:*Functional medicine \u2014 is a systems biology\u2013based approach that focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease.

When lockdown was officially announced, I side-eyed Phil to check his response. Something in the air felt kinda\u2026sexy?That night, as the reality of our new lives sunk in, I started looking forward to going into lockdown with Phil and spending some quality time together. He travels for work most weeks, so the time we have together is limited. Despite this, our Monday to Friday is filled with mushy texts, flirty FaceTime calls and passionate reunions; even though we\u2019ve been together for years, we struggle to keep our hands off each other and I still get butterflies when I see him.My head was spinning with ideas. Could this be the best excuse for a home-based honeymoon? Who needed to jet off somewhere exotic when you could have romantic picnics on the kitchen floor, steamy sex 24\/7, snogs in the hallway, candlelit baths and frisky makeout sessions in the utility room.This seemed like the perfect plan to me, and a realistic one too. Romance ain\u2019t dead in our relationship. Since we bought our house two-and-a-half years ago, I wake up to Phil making breakfast for me every morning (which varies between a Spanish omelette and an array of fruit and cereals laid out on the dining room table), all because he knows I struggle to function properly before 9am.So you can imagine why I thought lockdown would be like a Nicholas Sparks movie.But here\u2019s the thing. Pre-lockdown, we\u2019d normally start and finish the day together but now all routine has completely vanished. Being in isolation, working from home and going on one walk a day has meant our sleeping and eating patterns aren\u2019t aligning. I\u2019m guilty of going to bed and waking up later, whereas Phil\u2019s kept to his normal early riser routine. And where we\u2019d usually get all lovey-dovey after a film in the evening, coronavirus news updates have left us drained and overwhelmed.Despite this and given how affectionate our marriage is, I thought lovemaking in lockdown would be business as usual. More time at home = more sex, right? Wrong. Our days have somehow been filled with longer work hours, binge eating, rushing out to supermarkets, Houseparty chats, online workouts and COVID-19 news updates.And when it comes to feeling sexy in lockdown, I\u2019ve never felt so far from it. Not commuting into town for meetings or going out for dinner with friends has meant that wild hair is an around-the-clock look, makeup has been demoted to low priority and staying in my jammies \u2019til 2pm is a new vibe.On Thursday, we realised we just weren\u2019t prioritising spending time with each other, even though we were spending every minute together. I was 40 minutes into my virtual Zumba class, which was taking place in the kitchen, when Phil beckoned me to come upstairs. Sweating profusely and so out of breath from trying to master the upbeat salsa routine that I couldn\u2019t even give him a verbal rejection, we had to admit that our sex drives just weren\u2019t synching.When it hit home that this was not normal for us, we agreed we needed to find time together with absolutely no distractions. We had been guilty of thinking lockdown would inevitably lead to more time together, but that was complacent of us.It dawned on us that the time and effort we put into our marriage pre-COVID-19 was still required \u2014 if not more so.Finding peace in positivity and appreciation has helped us get back to a healthier mindset \u2014 and we\u2019re trying our best to stay away from Twitter and every news channel on the hour.As for myself, I\u2019ve learned the importance of self-care in lockdown. Attempting to get back to my skincare regime and pampering myself with face masks and at-home facials has been a saviour. Heck, I\u2019ve even started spritzing my signature fragrance every morning to feel more like myself. Focusing on my own mental wellbeing has helped us both, how we prioritise each other and can find meaning in this uncertain, frightening time.Love in lockdown is definitely a new challenge for couples, whether you\u2019ve just started dating, are happily married or celebrating a milestone anniversary. My advice is to try and accept that the world is in a stage of temporary grief. And while you\u2019re longing to get back to normality, be that a great sex life or resuming your favourite hobby, we\u2019re all just trying to find our new normal in this transition period. And that\u2019s okay.Originally published at https:\/\/refinery29.com.Written byWritten by","19494":"By Shani Silver\u201cI\u2019ll never ask for too much \/ Just all that you are \/ And everything that you do.\u201d \u2014 Whitney Houston, \u201cI Have Nothing,\u201d 1993I come from a long line of hard workers. Alternatively, I come from a long line of people who can\u2019t sit still. Idleness does not run in my family, we were never the type to sit and watch movies together, we were never the type to sit and do much at all. We\u2019re always in motion, always doing, working, fixing. So it\u2019s not a shock that I grew up to believe that doing less was the same thing as doing nothing. In my mind, the worst thing you can be is lazy. Then I spent 12 years as a single woman, and I\u2019m thinking that maybe doing nothing is the right thing to do.A little over a year ago, I deleted all my dating apps after a decade of fruitless use, and I haven\u2019t re-downloaded since. When friends, readers, or followers hear that I am 100% app-less, the first question is never, \u201c cool, what are you doing with all that free time you have now?\u201d Instead it\u2019s pretty much always, \u201c so then\u2026 like\u2026 what do you do? How do you find people to date? How often do you date? What do you do!?\u201d It\u2019s generally expressed with some degree of concern. They\u2019re concerned I\u2019m not doing enough about the fact that I\u2019m single.Basically the whole reason I get out of bed in the morning is to help single women understand that our singleness isn\u2019t a problem. It isn\u2019t something we have to \u201cdo\u201d something about. It isn\u2019t something about us that\u2019s broken, in need of fixing. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re all walking the streets with our shoulders dislocated and our noses gushing blood.\u201cHey lady, you gonna do something about that?\u201dNo, actually, I\u2019m good. But I wasn\u2019t always.In the era of my single life I\u2019ll call \u201cThe Before Times,\u201d single was something that was wrong with me \u2014 something that was part of my normal day-to-day. It wasn\u2019t a panicked feeling, finding a partner wasn\u2019t necessarily a goal as important as growing my career, it was just kind of a given. I was single, so I put effort into not being single anymore. That was the way life worked. Single was inherently wrong, and therefore needed to be fixed. When I\u2019d finished fixing it, when I found a partner, I wouldn\u2019t have to put effort into not being single anymore. Normal.The problem with that passive acceptance of my single status as a negative was that after a goddamn decade of trying to \u201cfix\u201d it, I was still single. Effort without reward will eventually catch up to absolutely everyone. We\u2019ll all wake up from the simulation mad as hell at some point. My \u201csome point\u201d was somewhere around mid-2018. Wasn\u2019t all that effort supposed to\u2026 I dunno, give me something in return eventually? But it didn\u2019t \u2014 ever. I mean seriously can you imagine trying to learn a new skill, language, or sport for an actual decade with no luck? You\u2019d give up somewhere in the middle of year two, if I\u2019m being generous. So I decided to find my own way to \u201cfix\u201d what was wrong with me. I decided there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with me to begin with. I found a way to end my singleness that had nothing to do with finding a man.\u201cThe guilt of doing nothing about our singleness is what keeps women going back for more bullshit.\u201dI know that\u2019s not an easy thing to hear. I also know that it\u2019s really easy to accept being single as a bad thing, because the alternative to being single is being in love. And we all want to be in love. I want to be in love, it sounds nice! And when love is the carrot we\u2019re chasing, it\u2019s easy to continuously, endlessly grab for it. It\u2019s easy to exhaust yourself, because supposedly what\u2019s waiting on the other side is worth it. My whole thing: Maybe there\u2019s more than just one other side. I think there has to be. Because there are way too many of us on this side of single that are taking it in the fucking shins.The word \u201csituationship\u201d shouldn\u2019t exist. The endless questions and points of confusion surrounding the people we date shouldn\u2019t exist. Dating memes shouldn\u2019t be a thing. Feeling exhausted and exasperated and hating dating because it feels like a second job, and a shitty one at that, shouldn\u2019t be what we\u2019re going through. But all of that does exist, because as single women, we still believe something is better than nothing. We still believe having \u201csomething going on\u201d feels better than crickets. We still call it crickets. We can\u2019t walk away from the bullshit of modern dating, because if we do, then we\u2019ll be doing nothing about our singleness. And we can\u2019t do nothing about our singleness. Because singleness is something that\u2019s wrong. Right?It\u2019s the guilt of doing nothing that makes single women re-download apps that never served us in the first place. The guilt of doing nothing keeps us going on every single date we manage to arrange, no matter what our gut is telling us about it. The guilt of doing nothing has us hanging on to one-word text messages and dumbass excuses about some guy being \u201cbusy with work\u201d or \u201cout of town\u201d or whatever they use to avoid having to say \u201c I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t like you enough to put in the effort you deserve.\u201d The guilt of doing nothing about our singleness is what keeps women going back for more bullshit.Doing nothing is harder than doing something. It isn\u2019t talked about much, but it\u2019s true. Doing nothing is the hardest something I\u2019ve ever done. And believe me, I catch myself hamster wheeling it through life all the time. Chasing down freelance work, constantly thinking I\u2019m not \u201cdoing\u201d enough to earn money as a writer. And I have to catch myself, and relax myself, and remind myself that not doing everything doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll have nothing. Work always comes, it always flows, and I find that it flows most abundantly when I stop worrying, stop hamster wheeling, and simply do what I love.\u201cI know this to be true because after a decade of doing every kind of something under the sun, I\u2019m still as single as I was when I started.\u201dThe same is true of dating. We don\u2019t have to do everything. We\u2019re allowed to do less, even \u2014 wait for it \u2014 do nothing, and deserve to have everything just the same. Love doesn\u2019t operate on algorithms. There is no if X, then Y. It\u2019s largely up to chance, luck, and the mysteries of human connection. I know this to be true because after a decade of doing every kind of something under the sun, I\u2019m still as single as I was when I started. And if dating is going to be the one area of life where effort and results don\u2019t have to match, where I have just as much chance of meeting my partner online as I do on an airplane, I\u2019d rather focus on doing things I love, stop doing things that don\u2019t serve me, and trust that I deserve love and companionship anyway.I made the choice to do less, to put less overt effort into finding a partner. Without question, my first year without dating apps was the happiest year of my adult life. I didn\u2019t spend my days swiping, I spent them creating. The space that used to be filled with no matches, no responses, and a massive void of nothing happening via online dating that constantly reminded me of how undesired I was all the time was suddenly full of things I loved, rather than full of an absence of love from someone else. And I know it\u2019s working, I know that doing \u201cnothing\u201d is exactly what I\u2019m meant to be doing, because nothing makes me happier than you reading the words I write. And when you and I connect with our partners, and we will, the relationships we have won\u2019t be \u201cfixing\u201d something. We were never broken.Originally published at https:\/\/refinery29.com.Written byWritten by","19708":"Recently, one popular research topic has revolved around how gut microbiota is interacting with their hosts and why it\u2019s important. The fact is that a growing body of evidence is suggesting that there\u2019s a significant relationship between aging and microbiota. And, research also shows that gut microbiota changes related to anti-aging are also widely occurring among animals.Some human-based studies are revealing a current trend in microbiota features that are also related to anti-aging. This shows increased gut microbiota diversity from when we\u2019re infants to when we become adults, decreasing with age. Results also showed that long-living individuals have greater gut microbiota diversity in general than even some younger people.So, what does research show regarding high microbiota diversity and general good health? It shows that gut microbiota in the elderly indicates that healthier subjects seem to have greater gut microbiota diversity. In fact, it\u2019s considerably greater than seniors who live in residential care long-term. So, these studies have produced information suggesting that long-living people could be acceptable models for further investigation. This could show whether gut microbiota promotes healthier aging and warrants further investigation.In some countries, long-living individuals over 90-years old account for approximately 1\/5000 to 1\/10,000 of the population. They generally present both good mental outlooks and excellent health. They have lower rates of hospitalization and shorter hospitalization time periods over their lifetime than the rest of the population. They also present the absence or delayed onsets of certain senile diseases, like Alzheimer\u2019s, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.Previous studies have indicated cancer prevalence in groups 60 to 80-years-old range between 25 percent and 42 percent. However, incidences of cancer and other causes of death decreased after 90 years old. So, long-living individuals are regarded as suitable models for healthier aging. In one recent study, there is one specific hypothesis that has been tested. It showed that the long-living individuals\u2019 gut microbiota can delay aging compared with those of the average lifespan.For testing, that hypothesis, gut microbiota from both typically aging seniors and long-living ones were transplanted into mice. They were analyzed for gut microbiota differences and longevity. One group of mice had greater beneficial bacteria and microbiota diversity. Therefore, this experiment presented vital evidence that long-living individuals\u2019 gut microbiota is capable of delaying host aging.Studies have also demonstrated that extreme longevity signatures exist in human gut microbiota. In addition, they differ from the microbiota of other individuals who are experiencing standard aging. That is why researchers are hypothesizing that long-living individuals\u2019 gut microbiota could slow down the aging process. This was tested via the use of microbiota transplantation. It showed that it is highly likely that transplantation of fecal microbiota from the long-living could reduce recipients\u2019 age-related dysfunctions.Overall, study results are indicating that mice who receive transplanted gut microbiota from long-living individuals possess more age-related beneficial bacteria. This shows the potential for using long-living individuals gut microbiota for anti-aging. Researchers also believe that the relationship between gut microbiota and aging is quite complex.All in all, tests show a very close relationship between gut microbiota and aging. This relationship is existing in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Furthermore, long-living individuals are excellent models for studies of healthy aging. This has prompted studies that involved transplantation of microbiota from long-living individuals to mice. This resulted in more beneficial bacteria and a marked reduction in aging-related indices. Further evidence is suggesting that some beneficial gut microbiota components could be lost in the aging process along with the accumulation of harmful effects.Study findings are also supporting the hypothesis that age-related microbiota could end up affecting the long-term aging of hosts. So, those results are also providing new insight into healthier aging. Additional studies will be necessary to confirm microbiota\u2019s role in long-living individuals, as well as its role in aging.Written byWritten by","19763":"From our life experience, it is natural to perceive the coronavirus pandemic as a catastrophe \u2014 a disease that threatens us and destroys our way of life. We see only negative effects because we\u2019ve never seen lasting positive changes in our reality \u2014 the good times end and everything eventually degrades and decays. We are born and enjoy a short period of hopeful youth only to realize that we are caught in a downward spiral of problems, disappointments, and disease until we finally die. As we observe human behavior and learn the history of mankind, we see that the world operates according to self-interest which inevitably leads to bad results. Logic forces us to agree with a negative outlook.Viewed through the egocentric lens of physicality, the default attitude toward the virus and lockdown is understandably gloomy \u2014 how many thousands will die until a vaccine is found; how deep will be the cuts to the economy; how many good times are being missed\u2026? Just as it is beyond the grasp of a child, whose freedom to harm himself and others is curtailed by a loving parent, to perceive his parent\u2019s actions as anything except punishment, we too are so limited by our narrow view of reality that we are unable to see beyond the physical consequences of the virus to imagine positive outcomes from the coronavirus pandemic.However, it is precisely through disruptions to our comfortable patterns that new insights and an enhanced capacity to comprehend the bigger picture are gained. Wellness is an active process of becoming aware of and making choices toward a healthy and fulfilling life that can spring out of this seeming catastrophe. This timeout period imposed upon us by the pandemic will allow us to enter a dynamic process of change and growth. We now have the opportunity to identify human egoism as the underlying root cause of disease in mind, body, and spirit and to dream up more effective strategies that encourage the sustained lifestyle changes necessary for people to thrive and perform to their highest potential.The coronavirus pandemic has equalized us all and thrust us to the cusp of profound metamorphosis. Our pain has cleared our vision, softened our hearts, and led us to the verge of the largest evolutionary leap of our existence. Our collective timeout has placed the scales of choice firmly in our hands and we must weigh our options carefully. Like the headstrong child who only learns his lessons the hard way, will we reactively choose short-sighted solutions that just mask the symptoms of humanity\u2019s illness and rush back to the same reckless lifestyle that sickened us until our next relapse? Or, will we focus proactively on prevention and maximizing vitality by adopting attitudes and lifestyles that create multi-dimensional wellness, a wellness that includes improved health, enhanced quality of life, and a sense of wellbeing?Wellness is \u201c\u2026a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\u201d \u2014 The World Health OrganizationThe coronavirus crisis is a stinging slap in the face of a cheeky humanity from a stern parent stopping us short in our self-destructive tracks. We are still smarting from the blow as we watch the death toll mount and the pandemic close in around us. Life and the future have become uncertain and the violent upheaval has reordered and clarified our priorities. We now realize that there will be no more \u201cliving my way\u201d without taking the whole world into account. Suddenly I grasp the fact that my survival depends on the tightly interconnected world in which I live. It\u2019s no longer philosophy, it\u2019s reality.The fear and pain have deepened our gratitude and made happiness more sublime. We see more clearly how precious our family, friends, and communities are and how easy it is to let go of the materialistic rat race that counted for nothing. A whole new yardstick of wellbeing has come into view where we measure success according to the quality of our relationships and not by what we own.Here we sit, alone in our rooms, with the clear message that there is an ironclad rule which we each must obey: Love your neighbor as yourself. The pandemic proves that we must harmonize with each other or nature will deal us blows. Right now, this means we must follow governmental directives and do our time, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t gaze in each other\u2019s eyes and consciously design a future where each achieves full potential. The sky is the limit after the pandemic has empowered us to live to love. Let\u2019s get well together and build a whole new world.Life is not merely to be alive, but to be well. -Marcus Valerius MartialWritten byWritten by","19775":"Quality sleep helps the brain to function at its best and the body healthy.Quality sleep is very important for brain function, as it is just more than a mental vacation. Scientists know that our sleep consists of stages of unconsciousness which our brain go through, as well as a series of psychological processes that restore both mind and body.At stages 3 and 4 for example, memories may be consolidated, while in dream sleep, the brain may be working on the resolutions to unconscious conflicts. However, if any factor like alcohol, a noisy issue, uncomfortable bedroom\/mattress, stress carried over from the day or drug intrudes, we upset the progressive stages of normal sleep, our body and especially brain misses the regeneration.The disturbance might even or likely to make itself felt in our next day activities, especially if mental clarity is necessary for getting the job done. Hence corporate management knows the effect of insomnia on employees\u2019 performance.Sleep Researcher, Wilse Webb of the University of Florida explained that sleep loss leads to errors because the heavy-eyed person simply does not care to attend to the problems at hand, and not because of actual loss of brainpower. He concluded that interesting tasks will continue to be performed quite well, while repetitive tasks are apt to suffer.Maintain A Journal \u2014 to monitor your sleep pattern (wake up time and sleep time), vis a vis the day\u2019s activities, such as meal times, naps, physical exercise. This is to be able to get how day time events are influencing your sleep.Maintain A Regular Bedtime \u2014 Charles A. Czeisler of Harvard Medical School Sleep Disorders Research Center, said,\u2018\u2019People just don\u2019t realize how important regularity in their sleeping habit is.\u2019\u2019He discovered that hampsters and blowflies whose schedule is shifted by six hours every week in experiments have a 25% shorter life span. And concluded that babies and adults are able to fall asleep easily when provided with the familiar cues of the same bedtime and the same sleeping space.During The Day \u2014 Realise your sleep nature. Some people thrive on naps, using them to compensate for hours of lost sleep at night. But others, an afternoon snooze may sabotage nighttime sleep.Regular exercise can set you up for a good night sleep, and may even reduce the amount of sleep you need, says Allan Ryan, editor in chief of the Physician and Sports Medicine.Release Emotional Stress \u2014 take time to release emotional stress during the day, whether through mental discipline, (meditation, playing a musical instrument, or reading), or through a physical outlet (jogging, tennis, yoga, or a walk).In The Evening \u2014 Reduce your coffee intake, take only water.Reduce nicotine, because nicotine is a powerful heart stimulant.Reduce or eliminate alcohol as well. Alcohol may seem calming but it will upset the rhythmic sleep patterns vital to a good night\u2019s rest. What's more, alcohol may give you wake up calls in the middle of the night with a full bladder.Vigorous exercise is not appropriate just before bed, as it leaves the body\u2019s systems in a charged-up state for several hours.Starchy or sweet foods enable the brain to produce more of a natural sedative, serotonin. Snack on fruits, crisps, grain-based foods or cereal.In The Bedroom \u2014 If you have a bedtime routine, stick to it, otherwise, your sleep may suffer if disrupted. So be aware of seemingly insignificant habits as brushing your hair or reading a few pages before turning out the light.Ensure your bed is only for sleep, and of course, love-making if applicable. Don\u2019t make your bed a home office where laptop and books are all littered about.Good passionate lovemaking is another good sleep aid.Reduce the noise level of TV or music if you have one in the bedroom.Better to put out lights, or if you must sleep with light, then, a dim light is better.Charles A Czeisler conducted an experiment in which he discovered that sleep patterns are tied to cyclic ups and downs of the body temperature, and we sleep best when our body temperature is at its 24-hour low.How Much Sleep Is Best \u2014 will depend on sleep quality, and from person to person. Dr Webb said most of us need between 6 to 9 hours each night, although there are few who get by with considerably less. Thomas Edison was said to be a four-hour sleep man.Our sleep requirements do not remain constant throughout our entire life. Newborns sleep some 18 hours a day, while older adults need an average of 6 hours.It is possible for people to adapt permanently to less sleep if need be if subjected to a period of sleep deprivation.Lack of quality sleep may lead to delirium in adult, especially with those with an underlying critical illness.Quality sleep is as vital as a balanced diet for optimal well being.Quality sleep boost a person\u2019s immunity in the long run.Written byWritten by","20355":"Healing from depression can feel like a waiting game. It\u2019s not a 24-hour bug or a headache that dissipates with enough water and Advil. It\u2019s usually a long and nonlinear journey back to feeling like yourself. When I was in the thick of my latest depressive episode, I became obsessed with googling \u201cways to ease depression\u201d and would read any article I could find on the subject. I also threw money at the problem. I bought any supplement that claimed it would boost my mood, got reiki, and even hired a life coach. I felt like there must be some magic fix hidden somewhere on the internet that would make it just go away. The search consumed me and didn\u2019t speed up my recovery process by any means. If anything, it took time away from the less-exciting\u2013 mostly free\u2013 things I knew I should\u2019ve been practicing. What are these practices you ask? Well, let me tell you. They\u2019re pretty standard and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read them before in dozens of other articles on this subject, but they\u2019re worth repeating. While they\u2019re not a cure-all, they really help lift your chin a bit when you\u2019re at your lowest.You wouldn\u2019t search for magic beans to get rid of a cold. You\u2019d rest, hydrate, take some Tylenol, and do whatever else you need to feel healthy again. Depression works the same way. There is no magic tonic you buy online and suddenly you\u2019re better. Do things that make you feel good. That\u2019s the key. When you\u2019re able to lift your chin a little bit higher, you can start to see over the hill to the other side. This gives you a little hope and makes you feel a little better\u2026then a little bit better\u2026and little by little you tip-toe your way back to feeling like yourself.Written byWritten by","20456":"There are several reasons for aging of our body, one of those reasons is the formation of free radicals in the body. How free radicals can damage our cells and enhance the process of aging, it is somehow a complicated secret to understand.When cells in the body use carbohydrates, fats, etc. in order to produce energy, the byproducts are also produced which are known as the free radicals. These free radicals could also produce outside the body. The things like X rays, Ozone, and so on are also responsible for the production of the free radicals.These free radicals could not be stopped at any cost, because as soon as the cells will produce energy these free radicals will produce. But we can reduce the number of free radicals in our body, it could be done with the help of enzymes better known as the antioxidants. Such antioxidants are present in the vegetable, fruits, grains we eat. We all know about vitamin C, vitamin E, etc., which are very effective in reducing such free radicals inside the body and help us in slowing down the process of aging. So, now we can simply understand that if the amount of free radicals is less than the antioxidants in the body, then it means we are going to look younger. But if the presence of free radicals is more than such antioxidants, then we should worry about it.If you are not taking the diet rich in antioxidant, you are going to face several skin aging problems in the near future.The studies in the late fifties has shown the facts that these free radicals cause aging and other diseases in the body. Till now, we have seen a lot of evidences which prove that the free radical is the biggest culprit.The doctors have shown the results that antioxidants can reduce the speed of the aging process. If the level of free radicals is less than the antioxidants, the process of aging would be slower and you will look younger. We have to maintain this equilibrium, but it gets affected by several other reasons.There are several things like stress, use of smartphones, laptops and computers in access, smoking, etc. are responsible for free radicals. It is the reason why some people look older than their age. People who adopt a healthy lifestyle stay young because they do not have the free radicals in access in their bodies.Written byWritten by","20871":"What would you do if someone ran in front of your car? If they were clearly in distress? And if they threw their body down on a busy highway?I ask for two reasons.The first is that I watched this happen last Sunday on Los Angeles\u2019 busy US-1 highway. The other is that I assumed people would stop and help.I\u2019ve replayed the scene in my head many times over since. How quickly I stopped, how she looked straight into my eyes, screamed, and laid down on the road; how I called for help, moved my car to protect her from other vehicles, and waited for someone to stop as instead hundreds of cars went by. Most diverted their eyes, many pulled out phones to document the scene, but none stopped until a beaten up sedan came to a halt.A woman with broad shoulders and a kind face opened her door and without any hesitation, walked over to the woman on ground. She sat right on the highway, and offered her a hand.It would seem that our ability to help isn\u2019t so much a lack of compassion, but empathy, the willingness to put ourselves in the other\u2019s shoes.As Brene Brown says, \u201cEmpathy is a choice, and it\u2019s a vulnerable choice because in order to connect with you, I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.\u201dWe\u2019re hardwired to help. We just have to remember we\u2019re safe enough to give, and this is true now more than ever.This Great Pause we\u2019re all living in is a moment that calls for greater community and emotional accompaniment. We\u2019re all going through something, and we\u2019re doing it together.On Saturday March 14, as we prepared to enter quarantine, the Kensh\u014d team came together to discuss how we could help. Being in the business of looking at health holistically, we knew that the forecasted risk was far more than the pandemic\u2019s impending death count, that loneliness, isolation, fear, and the desperation that comes from financial and familial volatility would take their toll too.After a quick discussion we realized we could make the biggest impact by quickly expanding access to the practitioners, holistic health practices, and resources we had at our fingertips.We put a call out to our provider community to see if they had any interest in offering a workshop or class to support these times and in a matter of minutes we found our 3x daily schedule booked for the next month. This quickly evolved into a digital retreat, where Kensho\u2019s community can find support at 8am, 12pm, and 5pm daily on Instagram.Over the past six weeks, we\u2019ve hosted nearly 100 free sessions, giving much-needed community and support to more than 100,000 attendees.As the weeks went on, our network of practitioners let us know they were discounting prices and would even waive fees entirely if a prospective client wasn\u2019t able to pay for support. When we asked our broader practitioner network if they\u2019d be comfortable doing the same, we heard a resounding yes. The next day, we announced \u201cHealth & Care for All,\u201d an initiative to make holistic health truly accessible with unified sliding scale pricing.As instagram messages from people looking for immediate support came in, often healthcare workers on the front lines, we introduced an informal concierge service to quickly connect them with qualified practitioners.Each of these innovations came as social forces asked us to adapt, and quickly. Perhaps none so much so as when we, like all of you, began to see the influx of suddenly free digital health offerings, from live yoga and dance classes, to group therapy, conscious cooking, and breathwork. Brands, practitioners, and studios got on board. There was a groundswell of giving, and we found ourselves having a hard time keeping it all straight: who was teaching what, when, and on what platform. So we built a spreadsheet to help ourselves to keep track of it all, then shared with a few friends and watched as a Google Doc went viral. Quick and sustained viewership was a signal that was need for a more dynamic solution.In a matter of days, we built Kensh\u014d Daily: a one-stop directory of free and donation-based digital holistic health and wellness classes and workshops.As the country began to ease into its new normal with the first few weeks of quarantine over, we began to hear from practitioners who were anxious and looking for advice on how to keep their businesses afloat, knowing that physical health practices and studios wouldn\u2019t be opening anytime soon. We quickly added a donate button to Daily, helping our practitioners take tax-free payments, and watched as our community gave back.As a company, we were up against a big choice ourselves. Quarantine happened to hit on the very same day we\u2019d planned to open our next round of funding. We could have continued \u2018driving down the road\u2019 as so many did that Sunday, but we saw a real need, so we stopped to help. We felt deep empathy for those whose lives had been disrupted, who were grieving the loss of stability, future plans, loved ones, and freedom. We were too. So we altered course and leaned into a deep belief that if we did the right thing, the rest would work itself out. And it has: capital presented itself, former team members reached out to offer support so we could bring new features to life quickly, a podcast host who had once interviewed me joined to lead social, and existing investors \u2014 Crosscut, Female Founders Fund, and Evolve\u2014 all reinvested so we could a breath.

It gives me a glimpse into a world I wish I could inhabit: a life where hiding my Autism isn\u2019t necessary, because I am wholly understood, accepted, and loved, no matter how strange I am or how much support I require.Boo\u2019s husband runs the account for the most part, though Boo provides input on much of the content, consents to all the posts, and is more comfortable sharing photos of herself on the account than her husband is. The husband writes lovingly about Boo\u2019s very Autistic habits, such as collecting toys and spending hours lining them up on the floor. He talks lightheartedly about how Boo finds certain hygiene requirements, like washing her hair, to be a sensory nightmare.The couple attends therapy together, and Boo\u2019s husband helps her study social cues and practice holding conversations. They work together to balance Boo\u2019s need for stimulation and noise with her husband\u2019s desire for a quiet, calm house. By all accounts, this husband is a top-tier Autism ally, someone who has educated himself a great deal and treats his wife\u2019s needs with respect. Even when she adopts an annoying self-stimulatory behavior, like repeating the word \u201cwow\u201d in an Owen Wilson voice hundreds of times a day, he appreciates Boo just as she is.Boo\u2019s needs are honored at her job, too. Boo has had a special interest in medicine for a long time, and the staff at her hospital recognize what an invaluable asset someone with her deep, almost obsessive knowledge base is. Boo prefers working with kids, and connects with them easily, so her bosses usually assign her shifts in the pediatric ward. When Boo goes nonverbal and temporarily loses the ability to speak, her workplace accommodates her, allowing her to use sign language with both coworkers and patients.Seeing an out, proud Autistic person receiving the support they need is very healing.As a person who has tried to hide my Autism all my life, seeing an out, proud, very obviously Autistic woman receive all this support makes me teary. I\u2019ve never been out in at any job. I waited for years before coming out to any loved ones or friends. I try to seem \u201cnormal\u201d around people even if they know I\u2019m Autistic, to put them at ease and reassure them that us neuroatypical people aren\u2019t that \u201cbad\u201d. I\u2019ve spent so many years trying to reign in my Autism that I couldn\u2019t let it all loose even if I wanted to.In the Autistic community, we refer to hiding our symptoms as \u201cmasking\u201d. When I suppress my desire to sway in place so I don\u2019t distract anyone at a work meeting, I\u2019m masking. When I leave the house and plaster a big, placid, nonthreatening smile on my face so that no one asks if I\u2019m \u201cangry\u201d or \u201ctired\u201d, I\u2019m masking too. Sometimes masking involves falling silent in large groups because it\u2019s unclear when the appropriate time to speak would be. Other times, it means skipping a social event entirely because it might make me panic and cry and hit myself in the head.In order to succeed in the neurotypical world, most of us have no choice but to mask. If we took the filter off and dropped the smiling, professional facade, we might not be allowed to participate in public life anymore. Openly Autistic people sometimes lose friends and jobs because of a moment of awkwardnes, all without ever being told what they\u2019ve done \u201cwrong\u201d. They can wind up profoundly isolated, without any resources. They can even lose their legal rights and autonomy if they start seeming too profoundly disabled.While masking is often necessary, it comes at a high price. Research shows that Autistic people who mask experience severe psychological side effects, such as depression and social anxiety. Long-term masking is exhausting, can cause breakdowns and burnout. It wears us down on an existential level, leaving us detached from any true sense of who we are. The trauma of masking for years might be why many Autistic people experience declines in functioning as we get older.When I was a child, I was far too bizarre, and I paid the social price for it. In order to survive, I started piecing together a more socially acceptable persona. As they years wore on, my mask shifted as the situation required it. I went from a sarcastic joker to a high-achieving go-getter; then I became a passive, forgettable face. I hid away every demand and desire, became someone who could slip under the radar and survive.Now at 32, I have been variety of people, and I don\u2019t always know who the real me is. My mask has fused itself to me, leaving me inhibited and confused, uncertain of how to break loose, left wondering if being authentic is even possible anymore.I have no choice but to don the mask. I wear it reflexively every day. Here is what that costs me.Last weekend, a tweet criticizing \u201cpicky eaters\u201d went viral. I\u2019m sure most people saw it as totally benign, but as an Autistic person, it was acute reminder of just how loathed neuroatypical people like me truly are:I\u2019m sure that when Ashley Reese wrote this, she believed she was just mocking \u201clazy\u201d people who choose not to eat vegetables because they don\u2019t care about their health. But what makes someone a picky eater? What keeps someone from succumbing to the massive social pressure to eat a more varied diet for 28 years? Often, it\u2019s a texture or taste aversion caused by Autism or sensory processing disorder. Or it\u2019s the compulsion to eat only familiar, \u201csafe\u201d foods, which often is caused by Autism or an eating disorder.The vast majority of people who remain \u201cpicky\u201d eaters well into adulthood have a logical, often disability-driven reason for it. But since being \u201cpicky\u201d is associated with being childish, it is derided as unattractive and embarrassing. All kinds of disabled traits get mocked in this way: collecting toys, loving cartoons, relying on one\u2019s parents for financial support, even having a \u201cneckbeard\u201d are all rejected as \u201cchildish\u201d traits. The adults most likely to engage in these behaviors are ones with disabilities.Our society has a lot of contempt for children, because they are not productive and they need help in order to live. Their passions aren\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d and their emotions are an annoyance to adults who have supposedly more important things to do. This disrespect of children bleeds into how we talk about disabled adults, who also have high support needs and hobbies that don\u2019t make anyone any money.As an adult Autistic, I\u2019ve internalized it all. I feel a simmering, low-grade shame about every habit that could look \u201cimmature\u201d to other people. When I cry, I fear it makes me look like a bawling infant, and I hate myself for it. I love cute animals and stuffed toys, but I worry this might make other people cringe. Even being too earnest and happy seems like a threat to maintaining my professional \u201cmask\u201d. Having to mask my Autism has made me hate some of the purest and most tender parts of myself. It\u2019s a constant struggle to get back in touch with my innocence.Autistic people have a lot of habits allistic folks find annoying. We flap our hands, bounce on the balls of our feet, yell, and repeat phrases or words that feel good in our mouths. These actions, which feel very natural and pleasurable to us, draw a lot of stares. As kids, we\u2019re often reproached for being distracting, annoying, and strange.Growing up Autistic means learning to constantly filter yourself. The twitches and chirps that soothe us make everyone else upset. Finding comfort by sitting upside down is somehow unacceptable. When we get excited about a topic, we want to talk about it endlessly, yet most people hate our info-dumping and find it tiresome and boring. I even lost some close friends as a child because parents disliked my \u201cweird\u201d mannerisms.Though masking often involves creating a fake, outgoing personality, an even larger part of it is inhibiting our natural impulses. Autistic people aren\u2019t always good at guessing what other people want to hear or see, after all. Often, all we can tell is that what feels right to us is wrong in everyone else\u2019s eyes. So we stop doing anything. Or saying anything. At all. We become quiet, restrained, inoffensive, void.When I\u2019m in public, I am painfully aware of how I am standing, what I\u2019m doing with my hands, how I\u2019m positioning my face. I\u2019m terrified to cross one of society\u2019s invisible lines, so I make myself as small as possible. I wait until the conversation hits a lull before speaking up. I fold my arms in tight. I try not to fidget, try not to even breathe too loudly.I don\u2019t know what normal is, but I know I sure as hell am not it, so I try to be as unlike myself as possible. Even when I want to open up to people, it\u2019s a real struggle. Controlling my every word and movement is so instinctive that I can\u2019t let it go.I\u2019ve always felt an implicit pressure to hide the parts of me that are \u201cneedy\u201d. I don\u2019t know how to ask for attention, or tell someone that I need cheering up. It feels perverse to do something like that, nearly invasive as masturbating in front of somebody.Just as I hate seeming childish to other people, I hate seeming weak or overly dependent. I have erected massive walls around myself, and only let socially acceptable traits pass through. I connect with others by helping them and listening to them. I have no idea how to ask for help, or what asking for help would even look like. I\u2019ve done things on my own as long as far back as I can remember. I\u2019m not sure where other people would even figure in.Many Autistic people struggle to name their emotions. It\u2019s taken me years of practice and therapy to develop even halfway decent emotional awareness. In the heat of the moment, I still struggle to know whether I am angry, sad, regretful, or embarrassed, and where those feelings might have come from. My partner finds it frustrating that I don\u2019t tell him what\u2019s bothering me until it has reached a blow-up point, but it\u2019s difficult for me to voice concerns before that. When I do have the awareness to speak up and ask for help with something, I\u2019m ashamed of my \u201cneediness\u201d for hours afterward.When I see neurotypical people effortlessly bearing their souls and connecting over shared trauma or loss, I can\u2019t help but mourn all the chances at bonding I\u2019ve squandered by being so icy and withdrawn. I\u2019m good at being candid, but only in a factual way. I don\u2019t know how to really be emotionally present with someone else and reveal my inner experiences. I\u2019m often far too fixated on managing the expectations and needs of those around me.Like many Autistic people, I\u2019m pretty easy to exploit and abuse. I take people literally and believe they mean what they say. I hate making people angry or sad and usually want to downplay conflict. I\u2019ve spent so long modifying myself for the sake of other people that I sometimes do it instinctively, and co-dependently, failing to realize until long afterward that I\u2019ve been taken advantage of.Research shows that Autistic people are at an increased risk of domestic abuse, because we tend to be a bit gullible, and are quick to alter ourselves to placate other people. Our disability makes us vulnerable; we\u2019re acutely aware that we live on the fringes of social acceptance. This makes us more likely to tolerate mistreatment from allistic people. We think we have to accept whatever relationships we can get.By the time an Autistic person is an adult, they\u2019ve been told to stop acting \u201cweird\u201d hundreds of times, starting when they were very young . They\u2019ve lost friends, romantic prospects, and maybe even jobs tons of times, often for violating nonsensical social rules that no one ever bothered to tell them about. This isn\u2019t intentional gaslighting, but it does amount to a decades-long campaign to make us doubt our every impulse and perception. We learn our sense of reality can\u2019t be trusted, and that authenticity will get us punished. This makes it very easy for us to fall under an abuser\u2019s thrall.Growing up, my dad was emotionally abusive. My instinct was always to manage his emotions for him. For years I severed as his proto-therapist, absorbing his every negative feeling and thought. My mom was much more well-intentioned, but she didn\u2019t know how to handle it when I became depressed as a teenager. I decided it was best for me to hide my pain from her, to try and be a fount of humor and entertainment.I carried these strategies over to every other relationship I had. I was always playing the role of either the unofficial therapist or the distracting, uplifting clown. By the time I was 21, I was trapped in a physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive relationship with a man who was all too happy to exploit my people-pleasing instincts.Though I escaped that abuse over a decade ago, I\u2019m still inclined to manage other people\u2019s emotions. I get too invested in situations that I don\u2019t involve me; I jump into action the second someone is upset or in need. In some activist spaces, I\u2019ve been guilted and manipulated into taking on responsibilities I could not handle; at some jobs, I\u2019ve doubled my workload to avoid ever being criticized. I never want to fulfill the stereotype of Autistic people being inconsiderate or unintentionally cruel, so I bend over backward trying to be giving, compassionate, and overly accommodating.\u2026Despite how negative this essay might seem, I\u2019m actually very happy to be Autistic. Autism has given me an analytical and creative brain. It allows me to hyper-focus on the topics and activities that inspire me. I\u2019ve become a better person thanks to my involvement in the Autism self-advocacy community, and forged lifelong friendships with people who help me feel normal and OK. The Autism is not the problem here. The pressure to hide my Autism is.I hope that some day I can be like Boo, openly Autistic and lovable and odd. I want to be out at work, the same way I\u2019m out among family and friends. I want to be able to stim in public, to let my face take on strange, awkward shapes, to ask for the professional and personal accommodating I deserve. I want to be unabashedly strange, to cry without shame, to share my weaknesses readily and to realize that such vulnerability makes me easier to love, not harder.I am very far away from attaining all that. The mask is so hard to take off. I\u2019ve worn it forever. It\u2019s become an integral part of who I am. But I want to learn how to let go of it. Masking has helped me survive in a world that is deeply ableist and cruel. But I don\u2019t want to survive by hiding anymore. I want be genuine and messy. I want to be me. I want to thrive.Written byWritten by","21175":"I\u2019m not a meat lover, either vegetarian. So I have been eating eggs daily for a long time in order to fulfill my protein requirement. At least two eggs daily. That\u2019s how my friends and relatives came up with warnings. Cholesterol. Heart deceases. Then I started to discover about eggs. I wondered after getting to know all these things about eggs. I would like to share what I have found so you can think about how you can fulfill your daily protein requirement, tolerate warnings from anyone, and enjoy your meal.It\u2019s a debatable topic, Are eggs good or bad? Some believe that, since eggs contain saturated fats and cholesterol, eggs are bad for health, while some believe that eggs are good since they contain lots of nutrients.Undoublty eggs are a good, inexpensive source for high-quality proteins. As well as eggs contain essential vitamins such as Vitamin A, D, B-6, Calcium, Magnesium, Iron, Cobalamin, Sodium, Potassium, and fats. Eggs contain both saturated and unsaturated fats 5g from (50g) large egg, and 186.5mg of cholesterol. Yes, the cholesterol content is a big amount. However, it\u2019s worth to find whether this really bad for heath or not?Recent research has found that our dietary cholesterol have not a great impact on our blood cholesterol as we previously thought. The studies suggest that the consumption of one egg per day may not be related to increasing the risk of heart disease, but specifically, those who ate an average of one egg per day had a 28% lower risk of death from stroke and an 18% lower risk of death from heart disease. Also, research has found that most of the cholesterol in our body is made by our liver and liver stimulated to make cholesterol primarily by saturated fats and trans fats in our diet, not dietary cholesterol. The researchers suggest that one explanation might be the fact that eggs contain heart-healthy nutrients, such as folate and omega-3 fatty acids. And also in some research has found that egg consumption has increased the Vitamin E absorption from co-consumed vegetables. Further, there are many health benefits that can obtain by having eggs.Since eggs are a perfect source for our nutrition supply it\u2019s good to find furthermore about Eggs.Sometimes I\u2019ve heard that some people questioning about the color of eggs. The color of egg maters but not the eggshell color. The eggshell color may vary from brown to white and olive green. Nutrient content in an egg is independent from its shell color while shell color depends on the breeds of hens. But the color of egg yolk is an indication of the nutritional quality of the egg. Also, the color of egg yolk is determined by the hen\u2019s diet. The darker egg yolk means that hen\u2019s diet is higher in green plants and deeply pigmented plant materials and the lighter yolks mean hen\u2019s diet high in wheat, barley, and cornmeal.When we went to the supermarket to buy eggs always confusing about labels on the cartons. Here\u2019s what those labels mean in brief.The eggs we buy in the supermarket are graded. But it\u2019s not about the size, color, or flavor of eggs. Therefore having knowledge about egg grades also important, because grades are given by considering both the exterior and interior quality of the egg. According to the USDA, egg grade may vary from grade AA, grade A to grade B while grade AA is the highest quality and grade B is the lowest quality.And also to find the freshness of the eggs that you have brought, you can simply use this method at your home. Place an egg in the glass of water, if the egg is fresh it lies flat at the bottom, if the egg it stands up it\u2019s getting worse, and if the egg floats throw it away. Further, you can store the eggs you brought home in the refrigerator, it\u2019s the best way to store. Eggs can keep fresh for about a month by refrigerating. If the eggs are power washed in the production, refrigerating is a must, because the washing process has removed the outer covering of the shell. The eggs which not power washed can be kept at room temperature also.Eggs are important not only they are full of nutrients, but also they are a versatile ingredient in a wide range of cooking. Eggs basically act asIn conclusion, nutritionists recommend that eating an egg per day is almost safe in a heart-friendly way if you are healthy. Eating whole eggs is better than eating egg whites, because egg yolks containing an abundance of nutrients, including vitamins and antioxidants. But the people with diabetes, hypertension and high cholesterol should be limit their egg intake.Although the egg is super nutritious food, there are some risks that could be occurred. It\u2019s possible to have an egg allergy for someone and those may experience skin rashes, trouble breathing, or stomachache after eating eggs. It\u2019s better to always have cooked eggs than the raw eggs because there is a risk to contaminate eaters with Salmonella when eating raw eggs.Further, it has found that raw egg whites have interfered with the absorption of biotin but by consuming cooked eggs the problem may be solved. In fact, whole eggs are a good source of biotin. And also it\u2019s important to pay attention to what we eat with eggs, because if we eat cheese, ham, white toast, and bacon may add lots of calories as well as lots of saturated fats to our meal. Therefore what we eat with eggs and how we eat eggs are also important. There are so many ways to cook eggs in delicious ways, but most common, easiest, and safest ways are hard-boiling, soft-boiling, poaching, and frying eggs (sunny side up, over easy, over medium and over well).I hope now you can free up your mind and enjoy your next meal with delicious egg recipes. :)Written byWritten by","21240":"\u201cMeditation is literally the art of doing nothing,\u201d Naval Ravikant says.You don\u2019t need an app to meditate. You don\u2019t need peaceful sounds or guided instructions. And you definitely don\u2019t need a $299 headband.All of these are distractions. By turning it into a billion-dollar industry, we\u2019ve done to meditation what humans always do: We overcomplicate it.\u201cAll you need to do for meditation is to sit down, close your eyes, comfortable position, whatever happens happens. If you think, you think. If you don\u2019t think, you don\u2019t think. Don\u2019t put it effort into it, don\u2019t put effort against it.\u201dThe purpose of meditation is to \u201cjust witness,\u201d Naval says. Concentration only helps insofar as it quiets our minds to the point where we can drop whatever we concentrate on, so you might as well go straight for the end game.When asked if he focuses on his breath or uses a specific technique, Naval goes: \u201cNothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.\u201d That\u2019s how much we\u2019ve baked virtue signaling into mindfulness: If you don\u2019t have any techniques to share or 1,000 minutes to display on your app, we\u2019ll doubt how legit you are. We\u2019re looking for gimmicks while you\u2019re doing the real thing.\u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that everybody says they do, but nobody actually does.\u201dIt\u2019s true. We turn meditation into a sport because the real practice is scary. Who wants to sit in solitude, alone with their mind? Who wants to face the void? No one. And yet, if we actually did it, we\u2019d benefit from it immensely.Noticing and processing are not the same thing. Being self-aware, I thought I didn\u2019t need meditation. I was wrong. For nine months now, I\u2019ve meditated every day, often just 5\u201310 minutes. Finally, on top of knowing what goes on in my life, I also make some time to acknowledge it, if only a few seconds. Like Naval, I just sit. I close my eyes, and whatever happens happens.Meditation won\u2019t solve all your problems, but it\u2019ll solve the problem of not dealing with your problems. It\u2019s not about being spiritual or smart or chasing some fleeting state of bliss, and it\u2019s definitely not about being better at it than your neighbor.Meditation is about making peace with yourself today. If you have the courage to look inside, that really is an option. To not just find peace but to create it.Tune out the noise, and give it an honest try. It just might change your life.Written byWritten by","21338":"Solange\u2019s last album. Patti\u2019s Pies. Self-care. That\u2019s a short list of life\u2019s joys that are misunderstood\u2026Most people see me as a high vibing, \u2018the glass is half full\u2019 kind of girl. I\u2019ll admit, as a self-employed writer who often travels, my life is pretty charming. I spend my days doing what I love when I feel like doing it. However, it wasn\u2019t always this way. Before life was charming, it was violent and unpredictable. I spent the better part of the last decade battling domestic violence, poverty, and substance abuse. I\u2019d gotten so used to toxic relationships that they became the norm.\u201cI just wish you cared for your Self more,\u201d a trusted friend confessed one day. A series of bad decisions and burnt bridges left everything from my job to my living arrangement hanging in the balance. I wanted to smack my friend back to the future for trying to tell me how to live my life. Still, I knew they were right. I may have mastered the art of survival but I knew nothing about the caring of Self.I spent the years that followed getting my shit together. I worked on releasing some bad habits and unhealthy relationships. I paid attention to my behavior; Am I contributing to this adverse situation\/relationship? What does my physical and mental health crave that it\u2019s not receiving? I focused on hydrating and minding the business that pays me. The more I poured into my Self, the more I began to enjoy life. Without realizing it, I had used self-care to achieve my goals and live a life that was far closer to my dreams.You probably don\u2019t need me to tell you that the \u2018wellness community\u2019 is littered with racism, ableism, and spiritual bypassing. It\u2019s dominated by non-Black people who have no regard for those of us who navigate dangerous intersections. They\u2019ve made a mockery of manifestation, often shaming those who can\u2019t will their way to health and abundance. They perpetuate the idea that self-care is all about bubble baths, day spas, and shopping. That, pampering oneself is the path to rejuvenation and healing. That idea is bullshit. Real self-care is meant to enhance life and combat the debilitating stresses we face on the daily. Self-care is meant to be complex, intensely personal, and healing in a way that allows room for more joy and abundance. More importantly, it has nothing to do with money. This is why ancestor Audre Lorde was adamant in reminding us that self-care is a radical act of warfare for Black women.Since late-2016, I have been acting as a self-care coach and have organized a variety of self-care fairs, workshops, and lectures. I don\u2019t know everything there is to know about self-care, but I\u2019m taking notes every day. What I know for sure is that there are three essential levels of caring for Self that can drastically improve one\u2019s quality-of-life:physical (this does not require a gym membership or yoga pants)emotionalspiritualBy focusing on the physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of self-care, I\u2019ve developed a variety of practices and routines designed to cater to those who need it most. Earlier this year I launched Casa de Tami, an intense retreat that focuses on teaching Black women the fundamentals of free self-care. The retreat took place in my home \u2014 hence the name, and was filled with activities like hydration monitoring, morning affirmations, and afternoon movement and manifestation. Like every other great plan for 2020, COVID-19 mucked it up. Instead of delaying all this much needed healing, I\u2019ve decided to go public with my free self-care syllabus.Hood Wellness is a combination of years of research, past work, trial and error, and teachings from Black folx who are way smarter than I.

In the beginning, fungi played an essential role in the development of our oxygen-rich atmosphere by mining phosphorous from the rocks and transferring it to plants to power photosynthesis. So, without fungi, your life as a human wouldn\u2019t be possible.Also, fungi decompose practically everything that dies or decays. Without fungi, death would engulf the Earth, and make it virtually uninhabitable for you and every other living organism.And Fungi impact your life significantly in ways you\u2019re likely unaware of, and you probably barely notice.You may not know it, but fungi figure prominently in your diet. Mushrooms are the fleshy, spore-producing, fruiting body of fungi. Typically, mushrooms grow above ground and are but a minute portion of the larger organism that grows below ground, weaving its way through the soil and among the roots of plants.No doubt you already know you can eat mushrooms and you should since they have a plethora of health benefits.Morels, shiitake, chanterelles, and truffles are considered delicacies. But mushrooms aren\u2019t the only way fungi appear in your diet. Molds of the genus Penicillium ripen many kinds of cheese.Fungi also ferment the grains and fruit to produce the beer and wine you drink, and they provide the wild yeast for bread.Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also known as baker\u2019s yeast, is an essential ingredient in natural sourdough bread making, a food that\u2019s been a staple of human life for thousands of years.A study in the Journal of Experimental Biology and Medicine found that all the common mushroom varieties reduced breast cancer cells by a whopping 33 percent. But breast cancer isn\u2019t the only type of cancer mushrooms help. Studies on prostate and stomach cancer show similar results.Beta-glucan and lentinan are two properties found in mushrooms that give your immune system a much-needed boost. Plus, they\u2019re high in crucial vitamins \u2014 many mushroom varieties contain high levels of vitamin D, and crimini mushrooms carry lots of B12, which makes them an excellent choice for vegetarians since B12 is most common in animal products.Red yeast rice is the earliest medicinal use of fungi on record. China developed it around 800 AD. Cultivating Monascus purpura (yeast) in rice produces a pharmaceutically active mixture of compounds.Now, millions of patients with life-threatening diseases are treated each year with medicines made from fungi. The medicinal value of fungal metabolites is a knowledge that\u2019s centuries old.Perhaps the most potent yet controversial fungal medicine is psilocybin mushrooms, medicinal properties have also been used for centuries.In his book, \u201cHow to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence,\u201d Michael Pollan delves deep into the history of these drugs.Pollan explains that psychedelics were once legal and used successfully in the US to treat mental disorders, including anxiety, depression, and addiction. According to Pollan, \u201cFor most of the 1950s and early 1960s, many in the psychiatric establishment regarded LSD and psilocybin as miracle drugs.\u201dHallucinogens alter your perception, mood, and a slew of other mental processes by working their magic on your brain\u2019s cortex. The drugs activate specific receptors called 5-HT2A receptors (2ARs) that are typically triggered by serotonin.This cascade of neurobiological changes to your brain helps you to experience a renewed wonder at everyday things. You\u2019ll have greater self-awareness. Your senses will be more acute so that colors appear more vibrant and sound, taste, and smell more intense. And you\u2019ll remain focused on the present.The positive effects remain long after the drugs have left the building. Participants reported a significant reduction in anxiety and depression after just one use.They also mentioned experiencing a \u201cspiritual awakening,\u201d which was responsible for a permanent shift in their consciousness. Afterward, participants said it was easier to stay focused on the present, and they had a greater awareness of the interconnectedness of all things.So, if you suffer from any of the aforementioned mental diseases, or you want to experience spiritual enlightenment and quiet the constant chatter in your mind, psilocybin mushrooms may be for you. And you may be wondering how to cultivate them.So, now that you know the extensive benefits of fungi and their mushrooms, are you ready to grow some? The following technique works for most types of mushrooms, but the focus of this article is on psilocybin cultivation.Currently, it\u2019s illegal to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms in most countries. But, right now, medical researchers are working diligently to prove the therapeutic efficacy of psychedelic drugs like psilocybin, and they\u2019ll likely be legal soon. So, you can learn the process for when they become legal. Because you, of course, wouldn\u2019t dream of breaking the law, right?At this point, you\u2019re probably wondering how long this process takes. That\u2019s a terrific question. Here\u2019s an approximate timeline:After two or so, the cakes will begin to turn blue, and no more mushrooms will form.All in all, the process takes from 4\u20136 weeks from spore inoculation to fruiting.You\u2019ll learn about each of these as we go through the steps. So, here goes:Phase one of your cultivation is where you\u2019ll create what\u2019s known as a birthing cake. A birthing cake is when mycelium has fully colonized your jar and wound around the substrate. When you turn it out of the mason jar, it will hold together like a cake and sprout mushrooms.Enemy number one in mushroom cultivation is harmful bacteria hijacking your inoculation jars. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to take the following steps to sterilize the jars and the surrounding environment. You\u2019re trying to keep minuscule microbes from creating murderous mayhem on your spores and multiplying in your jars.Choose a small room in your house, like a bathroom that you can use as your secret laboratory (prep space).Gather all the items on the phase one portion of your list. Don your face mask, enter the room and close the door.Spray the room down reasonably well with the disinfectant spray. Then put on your gloves.Wipe your jars off with rubbing alcohol using paper towels. Pay special attention to the top of the jar.Use your lighter and heat the metal portion of your hypodermic needle until it glows red. Typically hypodermic needles come pre-sterilized, so this is merely a precaution.After you sterilize the needle, don\u2019t lay it down, continue to hold it until the needle cools down.Shake your syringe to distribute the spores evenly. Insert the needle into the port and inject one cc into the jar.Repeat with the remaining jars, sterilize your needle each time.After injection, place your jars in a cardboard box, close the lid, and put it in a dark, warm place. You\u2019ll want a steady temp of 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. I know it\u2019s exciting, but try not to check your jars for five days. They need the dark.After five days or so, a fuzzy, white substance will start to form in your jars. When this happens, jump up and down and perform a joyful, happy dance because this is a good sign.The white substance you see is mycelium. Mycelium is the vegetative part of the fungus, similar to the roots of a plant. And the mushroom is like the flower on the plant.Let the mycelium grow for at least 15 days, and it can take much longer. Once your jars are 100-percent colonized by mycelium, wait a week then proceed to phase two.Now it\u2019s time to remove the birthing cakes from their jars. Over the next month, they\u2019ll sprout mushrooms \u2014 hopefully, a whole plethora of them.First, gather your jars and all the items on the list for phase two.Once your jars are fully colonized by mycelium, it\u2019s time to birth them and place them in the fruiting chamber so they can sprout mushrooms. But, the mycelium have been in an airtight container and have used all the moisture in the jars. They\u2019re going to be thirsty, so you\u2019re going to give them a nice soak for 12 to 24 hours before you place them in their new home.After your mycelium cakes have had their long, cold bath, it\u2019s finally time for them to go in the chamber.Pour boiling water and a bit of bleach into your container and swish it around to sterilize your container. Then rinse the container with boiling water without bleach. Then clean your flat mason jars lids the same way.Fill your spray bottle with 10 parts boiled water to one part hydrogen peroxide or H202.Create a layer of vermiculite or Pearlite on the bottom of your growing chamber and moisten it thoroughly with your H202 infused spray bottle. But don\u2019t soak it so much it\u2019s sitting in water.The vermiculite is there to help your growing chamber maintain humidity, and you will need to re-wet it periodically.Place your mason jar lids into the bed of vermiculite, then place a cake on each lid. Sprtiz each cake thoroughly with your h20\/h202 mixture, but not so much that puddles form. Make sure you leave enough room between each cake, so there\u2019s plenty of room for mushrooms to sprout without crowding each other.You may see little mushroom sprouts already forming, these are called pins. And that\u2019s a good thing.To check the health of your mycelium, give each cake a little sniff. They should smell faintly like the fresh mushrooms you buy from the store. If you smell foul odors, that a sign your mycelium may have harmful bacteria.Put the lid on your growing chamber and place it where it will receive indirect sunlight. The room should be well ventilated.For the next month or so, mist your mushroom twice a day with the water and hydrogen peroxide mixture. Keep an eye on your humidity\/temperature gauge. Ideally, you want to maintain a temperature in the mid to low 70\u2019s and humidity of 85-percent. If your humidity level is low, you may have to spritz them more frequently.When your mushrooms are ready for harvest, snap them off the birthing cake at the base of their stems and place them in an airtight container in your refrigerator.A harvest of mushrooms is called a flush. You can reuse the cakes for multiple flushes. Since this is an article for beginners, I\u2019m going to save those instructions for part two.The primary image in this article is one of a fully ripe birthing cake that\u2019s ready for harvest. As you can see, one cake can yield plenty of mushrooms. I recommend ten jars because that\u2019s how many jars most syringes will innoculate.Ten jars yield ten birthing cakes, which will produce more than a lifetimes supply for most people. You can start with fewer jars, which means you\u2019ll have leftover spores. Spores stay viable for eight months to one year, but dried mushrooms last far longer.Mushrooms stay fresh for 3\u201315 days. Keep them in the fridge as you would any mushroom. After that, dry them and place them in an airtight container. Then place the container in a cool, dark place.There is no set dosage for psilocybin mushrooms, so your dose depends on your size, sensitivity level, and the effect you desire. And it depends on the strength of the mushrooms. One mushroom can pack a punch, so start slow. You can\u2019t un-eat them if you take too much, but you can take more during your psychedelic journey. Just remember it can take up to an hour before you feel the effects.Your set and setting are just as crucial as the dose you take, and there are steps you can take to ensure a positive experience.Just like everything else in life, there are a gazillion methods for growing mushrooms. After you\u2019ve grown a batch or two, you can debate all the daunting details of the perfect fungus growing process with experienced, enthusiastic experts who will, no doubt, make comments on this article. But if you\u2019re a beginner, this is a simple method you can wrap your brain around.Do the number of steps feel a bit daunting? If so, re-read the steps until you can picture the entire process. Once you\u2019re familiar with the steps, they\u2019ll seem simple.Lastly, don\u2019t focus on the result; enjoy the entire process. To grow anything is a privilege. But to cultivate a substance that can heal your mind and soul and transform your consciousness without adverse side effects is the mystery and magic of nature, and it deserves your appreciation.Written byWritten by","21441":"As a society, we have made talking about anything to do with gut health, taboo. In doing so, we have inadvertently perpetuated the suffering and challenges that those with serious bowel conditions endure. Today is World IBD Day, a day dedicated to spreading awareness about Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, with the goal of improving diagnosis and increasing societal awareness of the difficulties faced by patients. The hope is that by opening up the conversation around IBDs and other gut disorders, we may mimic some of the positive progress we have seen happen for other conditions such as mental health \u2014 in lifting stigma, fear, and shame \u2014 bettering life for patients, their families and carers.Often described as \u2018invisible\u2019 illnesses, Inflammatory bowel diseases are lifelong autoimmune conditions that are relapsing and remitting in nature, affecting 10 million people worldwide. In the UK, roughly 300,000 people are currently diagnosed with either Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis \u2014 the two most common IBDs. With around 1 in 420 British people suffering ulcerative colitis and 1 in 650 affected by Crohn\u2019s, you\u2019d expect that we\u2019d all know more about these illnesses, but the reality is that many people have no idea about what the symptoms are, don\u2019t have a benchmark for what gut behaviours are \u2018normal\u2019 and are too embarrassed to discuss the goings on in their gut because as a society we are ashamed to talk about our bowel habits. The result? There are likely many more people unknowingly living with IBD \u2014 which is an issue, because early diagnosis leads to more successful management and better treatment outcomes.IBD symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions, which may be a contributing factor to late diagnosis. The disease and its symptoms can affect each patient differently, but during periods of active disease, common symptoms include:Frequent diarrheoa \u2014 5\u201330 times a day is not uncommon, and if you\u2019ve ever had food poisoning and know how unwell and weak it can make you feel, you get an idea of how unwell IBD patients can become after weeks, months and sometimes years of experiencing this symptom.Chronic constipation \u2014 this is less commonly seen, and is a symptom which can present as a result of inflammation of the rectum \u2014 the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract.Fatigue \u2014 for some patients with particularly virulent disease, this can be severe enough to impact their ability to execute light tasks or even walk short distances.Abdominal pain, nausea, and bloating \u2014 some patients don\u2019t experience these symptoms, whereas others describe the pain they experience as \u2018crippling\u2019.Blood and mucus in or on attempting to pass stool \u2014 this can occur as a result of damage to the GI tract due to ongoing inflammation. Blood in the stool is always a \u2018red flag\u2019 symptom and could indicate other medical conditions such as colon cancer, so if you spot this \u2014 either as fresh blood or blackish coloured bits (often described as looking like coffee grounds) \u2014 it\u2019s imperative to see your GP for a referral to a gastroenterologist.Extraintestinal symptoms \u2014 Although IBDs are illnesses of the GI tract, they are sometimes described as \u2018systemic\u2019 diseases. This is because the inflammation may affect other areas of the body. It\u2019s not uncommon for IBD patients to experience joint, eye and skin issues, though extraintestinal inflammation can affect anywhere in the body.One very important issue, which often goes forgotten, is the mental health impact of having a lifelong illness that can be unpredictable and difficult to manage. One survey revealed that during a flare up, 80% of IBD patients suffered anxiety and 60% reported symptoms of depression.If you notice any changes to your gut function lasting more than a few weeks, it\u2019s important to book an appointment with your GP to rule out other causes and to have your symptoms properly checked. If it\u2019s supected that you may have IBD, you should be referred to a gastroenterology team as soon as possible for further investigation.Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis patients are usually able to live a full life when they are in remission, however, during a flare \u2014 which may last many months or years, and can be extremely debilitating \u2014 ordinary life can be restricted. It affects everything from work to school to friendships and dating.Many young patients fear they may never have a \u2018normal\u2019 life, go on to find love, have a family or the career of their choice. For those of working age, career prospects can be curtailed, job security is a constant worry, and ability to be a great parent are a concern.For all patients, embarrassment and shame is a running theme, a simple commute on a bus or train can be petrifying, and fear of eating, failing to get to the bathroom on time, and what the future holds, loom large. Managing expectations of friends and family can be difficult too, especially when often, the impact of the disease isn\u2019t obvious.And it\u2019s not just patients who are affected;- parents lose around 20 working days per year in caring for their children with IBD.Ask them what you can do to improve things for them at this time. Many with chronic conditions are reluctant to request the support they need, and simply opening the conversation can be a start to improving their quality of life. If your friend with IBD has had to cancel social plans, consider offering to visit them if they would still like to meet. If your employee is in a flare and they fear the journey to work because they\u2019re feeling nauseous or concern about the lack of bathroom access, offer to allow them to work from home, or if they need a rest in the day, suggest they make up the extra hours in the evening if that works for them. We\u2019re all teleworking at the moment, so we know that for many jobs, it is perfectly possible to work in this way.Having a new diagnosis of IBD can raise feelings of fear and isolation, and you will likely have many questions. There are associations all over the world which are there to support you as well as to answer any queries and provide information on all aspects of the illness. In the UK, the main one is Crohn\u2019s and Colitis UK.Medical treatment is aimed at dampening inflammation and suppressing the immune system. There are a variety of different drugs which your medical team can try, but it can take some time to find an effective treatment, as not all medications work for everyone. Many respond well to drug therapy, but unfortunately some don\u2019t, which means around 23 to 45 percent of people with ulcerative colitis and up to 75 percent with Crohn\u2019s disease will require surgery at some point. Some surgeries can be life-changing, but more common are smaller operations to remove damaged parts of the GI tract. To make things more complicated, the course of the disease can be unpredictable, and a medication which may have been previously successful may not work for the same patient at another time.There is evidence that diet and lifestyle can contribute to the development of IBDs and may also be an important aspect of managing the condition. However, complementary measures or therapies should be just that \u2014 used to complement medical management to boost treatment outcomes. Additionally, some supplements such as probiotics \u2014 which can benefit some people \u2014 may be contraindicated for certain patients, and there is a risk of some supplements being unsuitable for use alongside specific medications. The inflammation which characterises IBD can quickly spiral out of control and lead to serious complications if incorrectly managed, so interventions such as diet and supplements should be incorporated only whilst under the care of your gastroenterologist of IBD nurse, and with the advice of a qualified and registered dietitian or nutritional therapist experienced in working with IBD patients. However, stress management techniques such as meditation, light exercise, and implementing good sleep hygiene, are safe to incorporate daily.During a relapse or first ever flare-up \u2014 which may have been going on for a while \u2014 it can be easy to feel as if life will be curtailed forever and you may not be able to achieve the goals and milestones that you envisage for yourself, or indeed simply to live a \u2018normal\u2019 life. Statistics show that the majority of patients will go on to enjoy periods of good health once their illness is well managed. Some may go on to have life-changing surgery, but with the right support, you can go on to achieve the career goals you dream of, travel, have a happy relationship or start a family. It can be hard to stay positive about the future when you are sick, but it\u2019s not uncommon for IBD patients to forget the difficult periods of a flare-up once they are back to health and making the most of life.Aliza Marogy pioneered the application of nutrition and functional medicine to health long before it became mainstream.She is the founder and CEO of Inessa \u2014 a leading and Amazon bestselling global supplement and wellness company, a respected clinical nutritionist and ND with a celebrity and high profile client base, media contributor to premium publications, and international speaker.Originally published at https:\/\/www.inessawellness.com on May 19th 2020Written byWritten by","21788":"The world cancer statistics are disturbing. There were an estimated 18 million cancer cases around the world in 2018. Of these, 9.5 million cases were in men, and 8.5 million in women. According to World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research, the ten most common types of cancer are as follows:With a growing global burden of cancer, prevention (or rather, risk reduction) is one of the most significant health challenges of this century. Today we look at living healthily through changing dietary patterns, reducing alcohol consumption, increasing physical activity, achieving and maintaining a health body weight, and more.As well as action by us as individuals, achieving healthy patterns of diet and sustained physical activity over the life course requires concerted and integrated action from all sectors of society, including civil society, the private sector, and health and other professions.An updated American Cancer Society guideline increases the amount of weekly physical activity recommended to reduce cancer risk. A focus remains on staying at a healthy weight, staying active throughout life, following a healthy eating pattern, and avoiding or limiting alcohol. I will add that we should avoid tobacco-containing products, and get adequate sleep.How much of a difference can lifestyle make? At least 18 percent of all cancer cases in the United States alone are related to a combination of these factors.The guideline \u2014 published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians \u2014 also suggests individuals reduce consumption of red and processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, processed foods and alcohol, and includes evidence-based strategies to reduce barriers to healthy eating and active living.\u201cWe update our guidelines as new scientific evidence becomes available. This update has been in the works for some time now and is finally available for release,\u201d Laura Makaroff, DO, senior vice president of prevention and early detection for American Cancer Society. \u201cThe updated recommendations reflect the totality of the evidence on diet and physical activity on cancer risk since the last guideline update in 2012.\u201dLet\u2019s turn to some of the key recommendations in this new guideline:We begin with physical activity. The updated American Cancer Society Guideline for Diet and Physical Activity for Cancer Prevention \u2014 published this week \u2014 recommends 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week.The previous guideline recommended at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity weekly.The guideline continues to emphasize and help people achieve and maintain a healthy body weight throughout life, as well as continue to be physically active. Moderate activity includes brisk walking and rigorous activity may consist of a light jog to get the heart pumping.The update also includes a recommendation for children to be moderately or vigorously active for at least one hour per day, including reducing the time spent being sedentary, such as with screen time.Regarding healthy eating, the updated guideline recommends all age groups consume high-nutrient foods in amounts that help achieve and maintain a healthy body weight. It specifically recommends a variety of vegetables, fruits and whole grains.Conversely, the guideline specifies that a healthy eating pattern limits or does not include red or processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages, highly processed foods or refined grain products.This new work emphasizes the importance of people composing a pattern to their diets. This healthy eating pattern starts with foods that are rich in nutrients, fruits, vegetables and whole grains, while limiting red meat and processed meat. You can eat a healthy diet with meat, but if you\u2019re following the recommended pattern, there is a little less room for it.It\u2019s the difference between eating several servings a week or several servings a day, which was a historical approach to our eating patterns. It also is very important for people to be cognizant of the amount of sugar in their diet because, if we\u2019re eating a diet full of refined sugar, we\u2019re not getting the healthy phytochemicals and fiber we need from fruits, vegetables and whole grains.(Don\u2019t shoot the messenger; I know I am about to hear from the red meat consumers! I would parenthetically add that that the evidence level to recommend elimination of red meat is low. I would also add my personal view that charring of food, with the creation of the potential carcinogen acrylamide, is unwise.)If I am in trouble for sharing the recommendations regarding diet (incuding red meat), I am about to get in more trouble: The guideline states that it is best to not consume alcohol, strengthening the recommendation from a previous guideline that recommended individuals limit consumption. For those who choose to drink alcohol, the updated guideline recommends maximum daily consumption of one drink for women and two for men.The updated guideline also includes a recommendation for community action.\u201cPublic, private and community organizations should work collaboratively at national, state and local levels to develop, advocate for and implement policy and environmental changes that increase access to affordable, nutritious foods; provide safe, enjoyable and accessible opportunities for physical activity; and limit alcohol for all individuals,\u201d it states.Clinicians should remember that helping individuals reduce their cancer risk and make healthy choices can have a significant impact on the nation\u2019s overall cancer burden, Makaroff said.\u201cWe must remember that up to 20% of all cancer cases in the U.S. have some compilation of excess body weight, physical activity and alcohol intake and that these individual risk factors are modifiable,\u201d Makaroff said. \u201cHelping to educate patients and empower them can make a big difference in reducing their risk for cancer.\u201dOver the 8 years since the last report, we have seen much more data from large, human studies, plus outstanding reviews from Health and Human Services\/National Institutes of Health, and updated guidelines from American Institute for Cancer Research and World Cancer Research Fund. All of these organizations have more precise data, so we know more than we did the last time American Cancer Society did its review.Instead of simply saying, \u201cWe need to exercise more,\u201d they are starting to put numbers to these recommendations. When you give numbers, you give people a clear and reasonable target they should work toward, based on good science.It also is important to recognize that, for many individuals, making healthy choices can be challenging.\u201cHelping the community develop strategies to break down barriers to help all people have access to healthy choices, including eating well and living a physically active lifestyle, is important,\u201d Makaroff said. \u201cThe guideline has more specific recommendations around community action for public, private and community organizations to work collaboratively to implement policy and environmental changes to help individuals make healthy choices.\u201dHere\u2019s the take of Steven Clinton, MD, PhD of The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center:We need to work at a government level \u2014 whether it is national, state or community \u2014 to make sure these recommendations are achievable by all people. This is particularly important for those who suffer from social or economic disparities, which contribute greatly to public health.Many people have a hard time meeting these guidelines because their world is challenging. They are working two or three jobs for minimum wage. As they are rushing around to feed their children, they can only find food at the convenient market at the gas station, and they\u2019ll pass 25 fast food restaurants before they can find a grocery store.We need to take action to ensure our communities have parks and other spaces where people can get the physical activity they need, and we need to improve access to good food \u2014 with more farmers markets, community gardens and similar initiatives \u2014 to reinforce these recommended health patterns. We can have all the guidelines we want, but the most important step is creating ways to implement those guidelines and making sure everyone can benefit from them.I\u2019m Dr. Michael Hunter. I hope you have a joy-filled day. Perhaps with a brisk walk!ReferencesWritten byWritten by","21893":"They echo. The words I wish I hadn\u2019t said. Images of the things I wish I had never done. The things people said to me that stung. It happens to everyone.Recently, my echoing thoughts got me thinking about the myth of Echo and Narcissus.In ancient Greek mythology, Echo fell in love with the beautiful Narcissus. Echo followed him wherever he went. She was too intimidated by his beauty to show herself to him and declare her love. When Narcissus thought he heard someone in the area, he\u2019d ask, \u201cwho\u2019s there?\u201d and Echo would repeat his words rather than acknowledge her presence.One day Narcissus saw himself reflected in a lake. His beauty transfixed him. He fell in love with himself. Unable to part with his reflection even for a moment, Narcissus died of starvation.After Narcissus drew his last breath, Echo\u2019s body soon withered away too. She died longing for the beautiful young man who never knew she existed. That is how Echo became an incorporeal voice. She wanders the world, still looking for her beautiful Narcissus. Sometimes, when we\u2019re beautiful, or in the right place, she follows us and repeats our words. Her voice is soft; that\u2019s how longing sounds. It\u2019s too deep to be loud.The inner voice that echos with negativity, from where does that come?What\u2019s it for?Is there an evolutionary basis for it?A mythological one?Does it keep us from loving ourselves so much that we fall too deeply in love with ourselves?If our inner voice\u2019s goal is to save us from the fate that befell Narcissus, perhaps it\u2019s a good thing.Self-love taken to the extreme is deadly. If not for ourselves, then perhaps for others, the ones who adore us like Echo.We do need to be able to keep a check on our self-adoring egos, but our inner negative voice goes too far.Where does the negative voice come from?Tara Brach, a Buddhist teacher, and psychologist describes in her book Radical Acceptance the \u201ctrance of unworthiness.\u201d In this trance state, we know we judge ourselves harshly, but we are unaware of how pervasive it is or how it seeps into our lives. It becomes our normal state.So what do we do with our negative voices?Plenty of people have written about the human propensity for negative self-talk and how to stop it. The answer I usually see is to focus on positivity. But doesn\u2019t that just lead us to see-saw back and forth? One day we love ourselves. The next day we despise us.I believe the answer, if there is one, is to listen to the talk, acknowledge it, recognize it without identifying with it. It\u2019s simply a part of being human.We don\u2019t need to drown it out to not to drown in it.We need not put our names on our critical voice. We can keep it separate and distinct from our identity.But perhaps we should have some compassion for our negative voice, our Echo. It fears our strength and our beauty even more than we do.~\u00a9 2020, A. Breslin.

It\u2019s hit or miss whether or not I\u2019ll even be awake at such an ungodly early hour, but this time, I was awake. And, despite not having the number saved, I decided to answer anyway.\u201cHi, Zachary? The is the receptionist from Dr. Jen\u2019s office.\u201dSidebar: I do not understand how people are perky and energetic so early in the morning. It makes no sense, and it goes against all of the laws of nature. Nobody should be so wired into well in the afternoon. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re in high school anymore. We\u2019re adults. There\u2019s no reason to be up for the sunrise.Anyway, once we affirmed that it was, indeed, me, she continued on.\u201cWe just got the reports from your last stay at the hospital, and we noticed the doctor wanted to do a CT scan. So we got that scheduled for you.\u201dOh, really? This had never been brought up during my last stay at the hospital, a 2 day adventure where the doctors basically loaded me up with Lasix and tried to get me to pee off a few dozen pounds of water weight; an attempt that only had limited success.That is, they got a lot off, but there is still a lot left \u2014 and enough swelling to re-open the old wounds on my right leg.\u201cWe scheduled that for the 2nd. But, before that, you\u2019re going to have to go to the imaging department and pick up a cleanse that you\u2019ll have to take before the test.\u201dAnd, all of a sudden, I\u2019m having a flashback to the episode of the Ditch Diggers podcast, where Ursula Vernon talks about taking a similar-sounding concoction, one that left her on the toilet for the entire evening, begging for toilet paper.Now, to be fair, it might not be that same concoction. It might be something totally innocent. But I have my doubts.Anyway, I thanked the receptionist for passing along the information, and I hung up. I might be a snarky asshole, but I save that for the blog and social media. I\u2019m not going to grutch at some lady who\u2019s trying to do her job \u2014 no matter how anxious\/worried\/unhappy I am.Et c\u2019est moi.I am a very large person. And the hospital likes to remind me that I\u2019m a very large person. And I\u2019ve been in and out of the hospital a lot lately. They never manage to broach the conversation in a non-awkward way.\u201cDo you know how much you weigh?\u201dHonestly, no.I know what I weighed when I was losing weight. I know that, after a shitload of hard work, I managed to drop somewhere in the neighborhood of 80\u2013100 pounds off my body.I know what I weighed before the Water Nation decided to attack, adding anywhere from 60\u2013100 pounds of fluid weight back to my body, including a gigantic, hard nodule on my lower right thigh, which probably weighs a good 30+ pounds by itself.But I give them a guesstimate. I give them my pre-weight loss weight. The whole, shameful number that I thought I\u2019d managed to fight my way away from, only to have it come right back. It\u2019s always a quiet disappointment.And, to be fair, there are no comic spit-takes of shock and horror when I give them the number. They manage to keep up their air of professionalism most of the time.Usually, they\u2019ll try to perform the test that they want. The only one they out-and-out said they couldn\u2019t do was the cardiac stress test. For that, they shipped me off to another hospital . . . who decided not to perform the test.But when they do perform the test, the results are never good. There\u2019s a phrase that tends to pop up quite a bit.This one\u2019s from an MRI, where I had to go into the claustrophobic tube and lay flat on my back for nearly 2 hours, in a world of pain. Of course, I didn\u2019t complain and stuck it out, but it actually didn\u2019t help for much, as you can see.From an echocardiogram (a.k.a. mauling my chest with an ultrasound probe).This is from an ultrasound taken of my legs, something that happens every time I go to the hospital, for any reason.I could go on and on with these. I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019m ready to get PATIENT BODY HABITUS tattooed across my chest.So, yeah. I\u2019m sensitive to it. On the other hand, I don\u2019t want anybody blowing smoke up my ass. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m unaware of the fact that I\u2019m fat. I just . . . don\u2019t need a reminder five times in the same medical report.One of the first responses I got when I mentioned that I had a CT coming up was \u201cGood! That means you\u2019ll get more information.\u201dExcept, odds are, I won\u2019t.Oh, I\u2019ll do the test, of course, if they let me on the machine. I\u2019ll drink that god-awful cleanse, shit my brains out, and show up for the scan.I\u2019ll lay down painfully flat on that tiny little bed-platform that I\u2019ll worry the entire time about breaking, and spend however long stuck inside the CT machine. And I\u2019ll do it all without complaining.But, odds are, a few weeks later, I\u2019ll get a report back that says the same thing as all of these: You\u2019re too fat for us to help you.It makes me wonder if there\u2019s a better way. It makes me wonder if I\u2019d be better off asking for a transfer to the local zoos here in Erie or Pittsburgh or Philadelphia.They\u2019ve got to have a CT for their big animals, right? Put me in with the pandas or the giraffes or the zebras, or something. Call it a medical safari, and bill my insurance company for the whole damn thing.Sure, it\u2019s embarrassing as all get-out. But no more than having to continually pray that I don\u2019t break the machines. And, maybe, it will actually lead to some useful test results.Maybe, for once, all the difficulty will be worth it.Learn all my tricks for writing a great query letter.Zach J.

This is a personal account of addiction, unfiltered and unbiased.]It never fails. Every time I talk about drugs or medicine, some well-meaning goomba busts into the comment section like a holier-than-thou Kool-Aid Man, to lecture me that I should absolutely not be doing that.It happened again, yesterday, about my Xanax intake. The latest vintage is so pitch-perfect boilerplate that I\u2019ve had to reshuffle my content calendar just to address it. So, here it is, taken as [sic].It scared the shit out of me to read that you are taking Xanax every day from last 9 years\u2026it doesn\u2019t heal you but just makes you numb and devoid of the the feeling to be alive.I have understood in my 30 years of living that what works is being with someone who actually loves you, support you and take care of you, that\u2019s the most effective remedy of every problem out there. I wish this blessing for every individual on this earth\u2026Amen!It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve \u2014 and therefore they\u2019ve \u2014 addressed my low-grade benzodiazepine dependence. It\u2019s a recurring aside here in the canon, but it\u2019s usually slipped very casually inside of other, larger, more socially relevant points.Yet, let\u2019s do some navel-gazing and talk about Xanax: why I take it, how it weaved its way into my nightly routine, my attempts to quit, and what I\u2019m doing about it now.In the decade of the 2000s, I endured roughly 200-ish panic attacks. On November 13, 2011, I had my first panic attack in almost a year.I was driving home to Austin from Dallas, following watching my beloved \u2014 and up until woebegone \u2014 Buffalo Bills lose 44\u20137. It was about a three-hour drive, and about halfway through, I had to pull over and lay flat on my back in the grass at a rest-stop. My girlfriend at the time was, shall we say, less than pleased.I had yet another panic attack less than a week later. I went to the ER. I was prescribed a week\u2019s supply of Xanax. I took it. I calmed down.On November 27, I \u2014 then, in transit from my girlfriend\u2019s birthday dinner to a surprise party I\u2019d planned for her \u2014 had another panic attack, which forced me to leave said party early. It was pretty fucking humiliating and, as I think about it now, still kinda is.The following day, I had yet another panic attack, and I went back to the ER, where I was, again, prescribed a week\u2019s supply of Xanax. The following week I went to a psych, complaining of recurring panic attacks. I\u2019d had at least one damn near every day for the previous three weeks. She prescribed me a month\u2019s worth.Every month since, for the past eight-and-a-half years, I\u2019ve re-upped. 30 days of 0.5mg peach generic alprazolam pills, every 30 days. I take it. I calm down.How much is 0.5mg? Precisely one-quarter of a bar. It\u2019s a comically low dose. Yet, for those of you who aren\u2019t used to chronic tranquilizer intake for chronic anxiety, let me inform you: even at that low dose, it\u2019s surprisingly difficult to stop.Let me unequivocally state that I, too, wish I was not taking Xanax. It\u2019s obviously not an ideal method for controlling anxiety, and it\u2019s not a form of healing.And, let me unequivocally also state that, if the withdrawal was even remotely tolerable, I would\u2019ve quit already. In fact, I\u2019ve tried that.I first tried quitting in late 2012 and early 2013. It led to repeated trips to the ER, thinking I was dying of respiratory failure, a hidden heart condition, a neurodegenerative disorder, or cancer. I racked up quite the tab at St. David\u2019s Medical Center in North Austin.As it turns out, hypochondria is a side-effect of benzodiazepine withdrawal. It\u2019s accompanied by sweats, insomnia, fog-brain (not a medical term), cognitive impairments, emotional instability, panic, depression, muscle twitching and a host of other assorted unpleasantness. (It can also be deadly.)I tried again in late-2014, as I was recovering from shoulder reconstruction surgery, and alprazolam is a contraindication with oxycodone. I stopped one to take the other \u2014 because they had just super-glued my labrum back onto my shoulder socket \u2014 and I immediately found myself back in the ER thinking I was dying of lung cancer.Once I\u2019d stepped down to Tylenol-3, some four weeks post-op, I restarted the Xanax regiment. Why? Because I was dizzy and sick and sad, and quitting Xanax cold-turkey is not recommended by any reputable medical source.I am, mostly, quite healthy. Sure, I\u2019m immunocompromised and I\u2019ve had chronic asthma my entire life, leaving my lungs to function like a used Ford Escort, so I\u2019m no stranger to medicine. In fact, I actively wonder what life might be like without needing to take medicine. I yearn for such a life.Yet, my mind is sharp, I\u2019m in decent shape, my blood pressure\u2019s great, and all my organs and vitals look good. I pass physicals with flying colors.The cost of chronic Xanax use at that 0.5mg dose is \u2026 well, that I can\u2019t just will myself to stop without a taper plan in place. To my knowledge, that\u2019s it. The cost of stopping? Well, I just read you the menu.The benefit? I don\u2019t have panic attacks the way I used to. I\u2019ve had precisely zero panic attacks in the past decade that weren\u2019t directly related to Xanax or alcohol withdrawal. I don\u2019t much drink anymore, either. And so I choose to soldier on, as I have.I could go to a 28-day rehab \u2014 which \u2026 no, no, no \u2026 It\u2019s expensive, time-consuming, and a bit like killing an ant with a bazooka \u2014 but I\u2019ve done the calculus and I\u2019ve, instead, elected to quit on my own. My doctor and psychotherapist said I could do this, also.And so, I started a taper in February. Three weeks in came Coronavirus, three months of self-isolation, economic depression and civilization collapse.That fucked with my plans and, when I told my doctor I needed an early refill in April, a nurse informed me, \u201cThis is one of the most common calls we\u2019ve gotten since this whole thing started.\u201d Apparently, I\u2019m in good, anxious company. I\u2019ll try again when a deadly virus I\u2019m at high risk for isn\u2019t breathing down my neck.So, yeah. Nine years of nightly benzodiazepines. Are you scared? I\u2019m not. I\u2019m scared of not taking them. I\u2019m aware that they don\u2019t heal me. They treat me.You know what else treats me? Therapy, running, attempts at SSRIs, ketamine infusions, plant-based diets, going easy on the booze and smokes, quality time with friends, writing and music.And, up until March, it was going just fine. I use Xanax, as prescribed. I do not abuse Xanax \u2026 I never have, and never will.Spare me your magical recommendations of \u201cbeing with someone who actually loves you, supports you and takes care of you.\u201d I\u2019ve had that, too. And I took Xanax all the way through those relationships, also.Maybe that makes me an addict. If so, then candidly, I wish I did more drugs, because taking Xanax has never been fun for me. It\u2019s always been medicine \u2026 just like the Symbicort, Singulair and Albuterol I\u2019ve breathed into my lungs, every day, since age 3. Those aren\u2019t fun, either, but if I quit them, I die.There will come a time, again, when I will work up the strength to taper. I have a 14-week plan in place to do so. It\u2019s been 14 weeks since I last tried to stop. I\u2019d be free and clear right now if a goddamned global pandemic didn\u2019t get in the way. I didn\u2019t bank on that, and I\u2019ll bet you didn\u2019t, either.Nobody knows how to handle what we\u2019re facing, and I\u2019m calling bullshit on anyone who claims to be handling this well. We all have our own ways of coping, and this is one of mine. I\u2019d enjoy it if you didn\u2019t judge me for it. I don\u2019t need the substance-shaming in the midst of all [*gestures at the tire-fire that is America, 2020] this.There\u2019s plenty of bigger evils worth aiming our ire at, plenty of more severe concerns worth addressing. I\u2019m far more scared of all that outside world nonsense than I am about a measly nightly quarter-bar of Xanax. I\u2019m not glorifying or excusing it, I\u2019m merely informing you of what is, and what has been, and what will be, until it\u2019s not.I promise I\u2019ll address my sedative ritual at a later date, and I\u2019d appreciate it if you gave me the grace that I \u2014 and my doctor \u2014 am giving myself in dealing with it. My ultimate goal is survival; this helps me survive.Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m going to take my inhalers and go for a run.Written byWritten by","22531":"It seems like I\u2019m surrounded by goal-oriented people. Which is, in all honesty, an oddity.But it\u2019s a pleasant one! I watch, transfixed, as they set out their goals: for the next month, the next six months, the next year, the next five years. All written out in neat and perfect bullet points. Not only do they know exactly where they want to go, but they know every step that it\u2019s going to take to get them there, bada bang, bada boom.They know each step, and all of the steps required for each step, and now that they have it written down, it\u2019s just a matter of doing it. They\u2019re sitting over here planning world domination, one step at a time, and it\u2019s all easy, peasy, lemon squeezy.And let me be clear. I\u2019m not speaking from a place of bitterness or scorn. I\u2019m in awe, wondering how the hell they do it.I\u2019m sitting over here in my tie-dye shirt, not entirely sure what day today is, or where I\u2019m going to be tomorrow. Alive? Probably. Mentally well? Maybe. Physically well? Comme ci, comme \u00e7a. Energetic, driven, and well-rested? No.But, hey, I am definitely alive. That\u2019s got to count for something, right?so happy for and encouraged by the thought of something that may or may not happen.I mean, I kind of get it. I used to be one of them. Like every weird kid in high school, I spent my time looking forward to college. I could be free of my family, studying the things I loved, and be around people that liked me for me. I would be my own person!The thought of going to college was the thing that sustained me through all of the bad things: the mean gym teachers, the peers that treated me with scorn or, else, ignored me, the difficult classes, the unrequited love. All the stuff that comes with being a fat weirdo loner in high school. Knowing that I\u2019d someday be far away from that, from there, and from the family that did not understand me was my encouragement. I was going to get the hell out of there.Spoilers: that didn\u2019t happen. Not because I didn\u2019t work my ass off, or make good impressions, or anything like that. It was, largely, due to financial aid reasons. Namely, I couldn\u2019t get tax information from my parents.So, even when I did get accepted to one of the two schools I could afford to apply to, I didn\u2019t have the money to put in the deposit, to say nothing of paying tuition.I think that was when my childhood shattered, learning that lesson: you can work hard, set goals, and do everything right. You can do all that work and still fail, still walk away with nothing.And that wasn\u2019t the only time in early adulthood that I\u2019d learn that lesson. Going through the slog of applying for hundreds of low-wage jobs, across two states, only to hear nothing back. Or, when I did hear something back, going out on a job interview and watching an interviewer\u2019s face close off the second they see your fat body.Every plan, a failure; every goal falling flat. Not being good enough, no matter how hard you work.But still. You follow the example of others around you, and you make up goals. Except they\u2019re goals that are impossible to reach.Things like:(If it sounds like I want to be like one of the vampires in Stephenie Meyer\u2019s books, well, yeah, actually! That would be pretty great.)Things that you know you can actually do. Things like write a blog post and a poem every day. Things so modest that they can\u2019t possibly make a difference.But you sit down, and it feels like busywork. You feel like a grown-ass adult sitting on a kiddie trike and making vroom sounds. You\u2019re pretending that these little, inconsequential things can make you into the person that you want to be. And so, it falls apart.Or your mental health falls apart. Or your physical health. And the next time you blink, you\u2019re six months into your one year goal, and you\u2019ve already failed.I think about the goals I\u2019ve made on here, especially when it comes to my weight loss.On one hand, I did almost pretty good at first. I lost 90 pounds. I was going to all of the doctors meetings for the surgery.And, then, out of left field, my leg started swelling up. It was so huge that I couldn\u2019t fit it beneath the steering wheel, so I could drive the 90 minutes to the surgeon\u2019s office.Eventually, all the weight I lost came back as water weight. And then, eventually (probably) it came back as weight-weight. And, now, I\u2019m the dumb-ass with dozens of old blog posts about how I\u2019m going to lose weight and completely change my life.\u201cOh, you sweet summer child.\u201d I can practically hear the mocking tone in George R.R. Martin\u2019s words.So, yeah. I watch in awe as my friends set and achieve goals. And I can\u2019t help but wonder why, when I try the same thing, I fail so much. It makes me wonder. My first instinct is to wonder: what could I do, if I tried?And then I remember: me trying isn\u2019t the problem.Then what is?Good question, inner voice. Good question.Learn all my tricks for writing a great query letter.Zach J. Payne is, to borrow the words of Lin-Manuel Miranda, \u201ca polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive Payne\u201d.
